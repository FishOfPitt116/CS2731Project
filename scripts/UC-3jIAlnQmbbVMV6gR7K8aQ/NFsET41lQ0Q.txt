but here's another sense of where the
some of the left is to Tulsi Gabbard
announced that she is running and you
know we've mentioned on this program
like I I think my the threshold from
when I think someone's stuff in
someone's background is problematic
changes based upon what position they're
going for smarter right yeah you
run for Congress there's 435 of them is
that what is her and you would know that
and 452 whatever somewhere around there
I can't remember the time I and you know
there's so many I can barely remember
this specific number so if you run for
Congress the freshmen but if you're
right for president and you you belong
to a I'm in a hate group or you speak in
front of a hate group and you there's a
little bit of cult in your background
and maybe your foreground I start to get
a little nervous like I don't you know
anybody from the fellowship to being the
presidency either right and so but
there's other people who have different
opinions and because I'm people who
oppose who's proposed war right
this clip is rich well let's just play
this because this is really part of our
core brand proposition to I give you
Jimmy door upon the announcement
Tasi kappa have you seen the intercept
of the humans report coverage of tolsey
i love tossie but if you read these
pieces you will learn some uncomfortable
truth that true let the Indian
journalists have pointed out looking
forward to Lorraine you know we're all
about reading about Tulsi and learning
more about her because Tulsi identifies
Hindu I need to hear from her about her
stance on Modi fascism a lot
Islamophobia imperialism in Kashmir and
whether she agrees morally with the
Keast system that is incredibly sexist
against women thanks for the donation I
don't have any I can tell you one thing
there's one thing I couldn't care less
about it's what's happening is in India
is that wrong of me to not care I mean
how does that affect me yeah there's
lots of bad governments all around the
world why should I give a about
another one I don't understand right
this isn't like saying like hey it's not
a good guy and so we should have troops
there I don't understand none of them
are good guys look like Israel's
doing it as medics on their border
that's our ally Turkey's our ally look
what we're doing in Yemen with our
allies Saudi Arabia I mean so this idea
of somehow but the people in the ugly
got her because she likes a guy in a
word bed with Saudi Arabia well
that's just ridiculous
they're gonna have a different litmus
test now for her than you have for every
other president including Barack
Obama so why do you oppose all those
other governments you care what happens
in Yemen but that's not their version of
their parody show right
I would never see that stupid
we just couldn't change the logo these
she's not that she's Hindu like I don't
think she deserves any specific extra
scrutiny because but it's her what she
has done and her so you cannot trust the
Hari Krishna's they've at the airport
they'll try to kidnap you it's a nice
boy of my neighborhood it listed he
became an IRA and he just ate vegetables
and never called his mob it was very
very that's stuck in my mom's craw for a
long time with that kid like literally
the thirty years later be careful at the
airport aside from that I don't know
really how to respond to something like
that where you just the the desire for
Tulsi Gabbard to be somebody that she's
not is extremely intense and she does go
surfing that makes you a progressive
that's pretty cool
the yeah it's three o'clock
[Laughter]
can we get that in the studio
did you imagine if somebody's like
uh-huh let's talk about your view of the
first principle it's like it's 2:45 put
down the phone sad let your people leave
stop torturing them Matt with the drop I
just to actually articulate those words
like I'm surprising and say I don't give
a about what's going on in India or
and and I don't wake up in the morning
and turn to the India section of the
paper I do but I know you do but this is
pretty stunning stuff and I think like
you know this is you know I think an
example of what a concern that we've had
for a long time at our show and why we
spend so much time sort of policing it
you know frankly Jimmy's show it I don't
think it's terribly effective that video
will get a hundred and fifty thousand
views and there'll be a lot of people
out there who you know Jimmy reefer cake
will send in a song next week that will
sing about people think we should ban
Jimmy reefer dick
not that many wow that's not as
overwhelming I don't think we should ban
them Wow good there's the 90% in the
middle of everything yes that gesture
like whatever just go on with the show
just clap exactly he's also a
guy who's done a million videos on Syria
and a couple weeks ago was just like
Roch Nava with the Kurds and
know that he literally didn't know about
the Kurdish areas anyways he's not a
leftist he's not a left us like I think
he's I think he is ideologically left I
think he's just not somebody who likes
to read I think you are you saying he's
a dum-dum
I think he can read but I'm not sure
no like people complain about leftist on
leftist violence when we make fun of
jimmy dore if you don't care about
people all over the world including on
the other side of this thing we
call borders you're not a leftist sorry
[Applause]
