opportunity you should always take it
and this listener what's his name again
Christian listener Christian was at
politican this past weekend I guess it
was right was it this past weekend and
ran in to my good friend Jesse Lee
Peterson who has been so supportive your
stableman of he's been so supportive of
me and of free discourse he called out
steven crowder as you know in a very
famous video that he made and i will
make it clear I did not ask Jesse Lee
Peterson to do that video I did not I
did I never even brought it up with him
yet he released the video calling for
Steven Crowder to debate me and I just
want to say kudos and I appreciate it
and now he's taking it one step further
listener Justin has gone and spoken to
Jesse Lee Peterson here it is

I know you'll be fairly moderate I don't
know what there's no
oh he's got one more I thought that was
great and and I want to make a tool I
would love him to be the moderator of
course I would take anyone as moderator
or no moderator I guess I guess it
wouldn't take anyone or someone's
dadaism I guess I wouldn't take anyone
although I would have taken Gavin
McGinnis as a moderator for Crowder
himself but that's about it
I don't know if I would you know but so
I'm not gonna say any moderator I'm
gonna say I will take Jesse Lee Peterson
up on this he's been so gracious in
supporting this call for steven crowder
