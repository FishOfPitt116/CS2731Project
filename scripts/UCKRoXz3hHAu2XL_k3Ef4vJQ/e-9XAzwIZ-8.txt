hey everybody
it's time for a very special okay stop
here with
john favreau hi tommy vitor
hello julissa arsey hello the whole
qriket family is here
uh earlier tonight the person occupying
the oval office
a job once held by american presidents
gave his first and ideally second to
last oval office address
the topic was immigration and the border
and trump's efforts to manufacture a
crisis in order to justify his impulsive
decision
to shut down the government and
blackmail congress to get five billion
dollars in wall funding
after republicans and democrats in the
senate unanimously passed a spending to
without it
what did he say to become a different
person were the network executives
feckless wimps for running the speech
let's find out an exciting episode i
love this mystery
my fellow americans tonight i am
speaking to you
because there is a growing humanitarian
and security crisis
at our southern border every day customs
and border patrol agents
encounter thousands of illegal
immigrants trying to enter our country
we are out of space to hold them and we
have no way to promptly return them
back home to their country okay stop
so we are out of space to hold them
that one really stuck out of me uh
julissa what do you make of that
okay first of all i would like to point
out that he's given the address from the
oval office and behind him presumably
are his immigrant parents
and he's speaking about keeping
immigrants out
and this whole this whole we're running
out of room
 uh no they're not a country
because
big country well and also you know we
used to we used in 1994 we used to hold
maybe 7
000 immigrants in detention as of 2018
it was 32 38 000 immigrants that were
holding in detention and in his proposed
2019 budget
he's asking for 52 000 detention beds so
this idea that we're running out of room
and that's why we should build a wall
is it's really idiotic because he is
asking for more detention bets
uh julius i just want to correct one
thing that i believe is factually
inaccurate i'm not sure that those are a
picture of his parents i believe he got
those at an
old-timey racist frame store
it's possible it's it's also worth
noting
that he started this speech by talking
about immigration
making up this this crisis on the border
the federal government shutdown
yeah this is the speech he gave prime
time because the federal government is
shut down there's 800 000 people who
aren't working right now
government services aren't being
delivered and
he just like he starts this whole
beginning of the speech is talking about
immigration
can i can i say one thing about the
people who are being affected by the
by the shutdown because yes of course
you know like craft brewers can't like
print labels for their new
beer that's really affecting me
personally
um but one one group of people that
we're not talking about
um at all really are native americans
who are
who are highly affected by this because
they heavily depend
on federal payments to
run very basic functions like having
their clinics open and having their
schools open and having their roads
be available to people to drive on so to
me
i've like really want to let this set
like settle in my head that we that
native americans are suffering over a
government shutdown
because trump wants to build a wall to
keep people out of
of the country land that we stole from
them and now they're the ones suffering
for it right
ironically they're the ones who could
point to an immigration crisis yeah and
by the way there is no crisis illegal
border crossings are way down in 2000 it
was 1.6 million people apprehended
trying to cross the southern border
in 2018 it was less than 400 thousand
and two-thirds
are people of undocumented immigrants in
the us did not sneak across the border
they flew here on an airplane and then
just overstayed their visas so
this is made-up
america proudly welcomes millions of
lawful immigrants
who enrich our society and contribute to
our nation
but all americans are hurt by
uncontrolled
illegal migration it strains public
resources
and drives down jobs and wages among
those hardest hit
are african americans and hispanic
americans
okay our southern here we go i mean i
could
i could have predicted i mean i was like
this is he's gonna go to the
race-baiting fear-mongering
uh you know the the pinning of the
latino community versus the
african-american community
he doesn't give a about our
communities all he cares about is that
we think we're in competition with one
another
and that we fight for the scraps and
i'm so tired of it like no this is not
this this whole speech is not about the
latino community it's not about how do
we help latinos how do we help
african americans it's simply about
painting our communities against each
other
it's also worth remembering that there
was a deal so we're now in a shutdown
because he threw a fit
because of ann coulter and democrats
getting attention after they won the
house
and he's saying he wants this 5 billion
for nothing democrats there was a deal
on the table for him to get 25 billion
for the border to just all he had to do
was protect dreamers who made who
did nothing wrong by coming here and one
of the reasons that he turned down that
deal
is because he wanted to reduce legal
immigration which he just claimed here
was something something he really cares
about yeah
orders a pipeline for vast quantities of
illegal drugs
including meth heroin cocaine and
fentanyl
okay stop oh just real quick most drugs
that enter the us from the southern
border are in legal shipments or
smuggled in passenger vehicles so
his stupid wall would do nothing to stop
that and the fentanyl comes through the
mail from china which apparently he
tweeted a couple years ago
so he knows that like he really needs to
watch like uh he really needs to listen
to
el chapo uh the podcast i think he'll
learn a lot from how
el chapo smuggled drugs into the country
which
was not you know through the through
through the i mean a lot of it came
through like
tunnels and to your point like shipments
so
a wall is not stopping the drugs and we
know that because that is what
the dea tells us the government agency
over the years thousands of americans
have been brutally killed
by those who illegally entered our
country and
thousands more lives will be lost if we
don't act
right now this is a humanitarian crisis
a crisis of the heart and a crisis
of the soul okay stop i just just a
quick note on crisis of the heart and
crisis
of the soul there is nothing everyone
said away that donald trump
is less capable of delivering than
something that's meant to evoke
human empathy which i don't even think
that was every once in a while we're
treated to some
really awful stephen miller's speech
writing it's um and that is
a great example yeah it is a reminder
it's like the american carnage
thing it's sort of like an over rot the
dregs of republican politics
a crisis of the heart what is it what
does it mean anything what are you
talking about the difference between are
you talking about the heart and a crisis
of the soul what's the difference like a
total eclipse of the heart
it's like slightly worse it's like she's
like needed a few extra words
and also none of this is actually about
human life like he doesn't
care about human life like we've had
jacqueline seven-year-old watermelon
girl who
died at the custody of the u.s
government felipe gomez the
eight-year-old watermelon
boy that died at the hands of in the
custody of the u.s
of u.s custody and you know not to
mention that we've had 185 deaths that
ice has recognized so people who have
died in their custody from
2003 to 2018.
so he doesn't care about humanity that's
a humanitarian crisis exactly
that we have that we've separated how
many children from their parents and we
don't know where some of them are
and so far he hasn't said anything about
how do we actually process claims for
asylum
because if this is a humanitarian crisis
and it's about people seeking asylum
and we care about human life then why
aren't we talking about
how do we actually process this claim so
that people can come
into the country legally yeah well i
mean that's that's a great point because
the one thing that has changed because
border crossings are at you know a
two-decade
low but there has been an influx in
people and women and children
specifically families and children
seeking asylum everyone agrees except
this
that um you can build a wall across the
entire border
that's not going to stop people from
going to ports of entry and trying to
claim asylum which they're legally
allowed to do
and the reason that there's such an
influx and that we have
we're all backed up is because there's
not enough immigration judges to process
the claims and so
like he has created and they're
furloughed he is because of the shutdown
he has created his
own crisis on the border based on
people seeking asylum because he's
refusing to grant them asylum or even
process their claims
right
of an overall approach to border
security law enforcement professionals
have requested
5.7 billion dollars for a physical
barrier
at the request of democrats it will be a
steel barrier
rather than a concrete wall okay stop
that's just a lie
democrats didn't request that at all
look we've been critical of chuck
schumer in the past but chuck schumer
did not go up to donald trump it's like
i don't like concrete i want metal
i want something made of you know
something that combines some metals that
i like
who is that talking point convincing
what's the value of it if it were true
what the are we doing why is a
steel wall less than a cement wall i
don't know i don't yo
where did we get this why does he think
that's good why does this
think that's good
damn i was gonna call him a
i wanted to get one in
like it's gonna uh look you know these
democrats they hate cement
classic liberals you know with their
with their socialism and their
they're dancing they're dancing new
yorkers fine i'll give you steel you
want steal i'll give you steel you're
happy now that ocasio-cortez
instagram living her cement pouring
activities at the same
this barrier is absolutely critical to
border security
it's also what our professionals at the
border want
sniffing indeed this is just
common sense the border wall would very
quickly
pay for itself okay what would it be
the wall is not getting a job what are
you talking about
um it won't pay for itself he's
right first he's like mexico's gonna pay
for it then he's like
it's gonna pay for itself trump in 2020
is gonna be like the aliens are gonna
pay for it
i'm like no and also you know when he's
saying like oh we asked people
and they told us that they wanted the
wall well guess what there are 15
million
people that live along the border like
sometimes we talk about the border as it
as though it was this like abstract
place in our minds but there are actual
real people that live there 15 million
of them
and in a recent survey 65 of them said
they definitely do not want a wall going
across
their backyard people who live along the
border don't think there's a crisis and
they don't want a wall the people who
think that and believe that
are fox news viewers we just ran an
election where
uh trump's entire closing argument was
another made-up order crisis about this
caravan
and the result of that election was
aside from losing 40 seats in the house
he also lost two republican seats along
the border
and now the only uh person who is a
republican
who still holds office that has a border
district is will hurd who says that the
reason he won his election in a tough
year for republicans is because he
opposed the border wall
so that is that is the politics of uh
the border and border walls it's also
like you know you step back
like i would love to go back to the
campaign where
donald trump's favorite sentence was
we're going to build a wall mexico is
going to pay for it
but if they don't i'll shut down the
government to get you to pay for it
and then i'll say it pay it for itself
based on nothing and i'll change it from
concrete to steel if you're
still upset about it what do you want
the wallet
you want rubber solar panels
force field what happened to the solar
panels so solar panels on the wall
so the legal drugs exceeds 500 billion
dollars a year
vastly more than the 5.7 billion dollars
we have requested from congress
what is he slipping i was a bit like
what
it's not you know that when we
confiscate drugs we don't get to turn
around and sell it
i don't know that he doesn't you know
like you know we stu
we get you know i think in his mind he
thinks that the dea sells the cocaine it
seizes
you know they should peter get a fact
check on that does the da sell the
cocaine
seasons we found a funding mechanism he
doesn't think so didn't
what's his name ted cruz i hate that guy
didn't he like uh introduce some bill
called like a chapo
el chapo bill oh i don't know yeah
because so he he wants like the money
that we seized from el chapo
to go towards paying for the wall like i
thought it was a joke
but it's actually something he proposed
we paid for indirectly by the great new
trade deal
we have made with mexico senator chuck
schumer
who you will be hearing from later
tonight
okay i just i love that he gives a
preview of chuck's be like welcome to
the show tonight you're gonna hear from
me then you're gonna hear from chuck and
nancy i'm headlining but after me
and also he doesn't even mention nancy
he's like you're gonna hear from chuck
schumer
except like nancy is in line as you were
saying earlier to take your job you know
if it came down to it
and show little respect you preempted
ellen's game of games
repeatedly supported a physical barrier
in the past
along with many other democrats they
changed their mind
only after i was elected president okay
stop so
who changed their mind here i mean
actually but what's interesting
about it though is indirectly he is
pointing to something that is true which
is
uh over the last what 15 years we have
steadily increased funding for border
security it's true under george w bush
was true under obama
there is an unprecedented amount of
funding for border security and
unprecedented amount of manpower on
border security it's in part as john
mentioned
why illegal crossings are down i mean
one of the
remember when barack obama was trying to
get a comprehensive immigration bill
passed
one of the points he made over and over
again is every time he tries to get a
comprehensive immigration deal
republicans come back and say we want
more border security and every time we
said yes
i remember writing this speech with you
in 2011 with him and he was like
every single request they've uh they've
asked for for border security we've done
it and they still won't do anything
about a path to success
drones you get drones you want you want
more boots on the ground you get boots
on the ground you want
he said you want them you want a wall
you'll get a wall because they were they
were giving him money for these
they were we have spent an incredible
amount of money on this already
trump's chief of staff mick mulvaney
gave up the whole thing in 2015 when he
said the wall is stupid it's not going
to work it's a thing you can sell
politically yeah it was just
it's an image we were saying oh you want
you want more we'll give you a moat that
was what that was our final
thing about we just think we just heard
those when he said oh then they changed
their mind the person
who changed his mind was donald trump he
backed a continuing resolution that
would have funded the government with no
5.7 billion for the border wall
republicans passed it through the senate
a hundred to nothing
he was all ready to go and then ann
coulter got mad so here we are
doing this thing yeah and like
the the fact that that mitch mcconnell
and lindsey graham and the rest of these
douche nozzles don't have whiplash from
how quickly they switched their position
they passed it no funding for the border
wall
they they obviously would not have
passed it a hundred to zero if they knew
trump was going to pitch a fit
then he does this demands the house does
it of course paul ryan and his uh
merry band of goons back in the bad old
days before the house was
run by a cool old lady
[Laughter]
who i love uh went along with it and
then mitch mcconnell said he won't even
consider
a bill without the border funding which
is insane because he passed it
a week ago remember a week ago anyway
he's given a great address
democrats in congress have refused to
acknowledge
the crisis and they have refused to
provide
our brave border agents with the tools
they desperately need
to protect our families and our nation
low energy the federal government
remains shut down
for one reason the first time you
brought the shutdown only
because democrats will not fund
border security my administration
is doing everything and there's enough
oxygen in there those
impacted by the situation
but the only solution is for democrats
to pass a spending bill
that defends our borders and reopens the
government
this situation i mean at some point as a
country we'll have to talk about the
sniffing
he only does it before major primetime
addresses um
look you can go google it there's a guy
that worked on the apprentice who says
donald trump
uh is putting stuff up his nose and it's
not his finger so
what it's a drug station
yeah maybe he already does talk to el
chapo that would be a twist
what if he's doing this to control the
market have you people seen ozark
what if this is ozark spoiler i'm not
spoiling it i don't i mean it's not
actually happening in ozark
but here's the thing right like first
they they first he yells like the reason
we need a wall is because
uh rapist and then he uh said it's ms-13
and then the caravan
and now they're screaming terrorists and
now he's saying the reason the
government shut down is because
democrats
but i'm just gonna tell you that what it
is is a bunch of
yeah yeah that's it it's
could be solved in a 45 minute
meeting some have suggested a barrier
is immoral then why do wealthy
politicians
build walls fences and gates around
their homes
they don't build walls because they hate
the people on the outside
debatable but because they're very
debatable people on the inside
also debatable what is immoral
is the politicians to do nothing and
continue to allow
more innocent people to be so horrible
okay
okay stop this would piss me off for
this whole debate like we spent all this
time debating whether or not there is a
crisis we spend almost no time just
reminding the world that the wall
would not fix the problem even if there
was a crisis it is not a deterrent to
smugglers or traffickers it's not going
to
stop the demand for drugs or the
interest
for people living in places with
horrible political situations to come to
the united states
it's a waste of time and money
and it's a political symbol and like
i just hate how the press corps gets led
down this path where we debate the
crisis and the stats when it's like your
solution is
well it's always not gonna and it's not
going to even dent the issue
at the border right now which is an
influx of people trying to claim asylum
that's not
the wall's not going to do anything
about that right because that's not
like the core of the issue of why people
are living or they're leaving their
countries like we're not even addressing
that at all right we're not addressing
the
the aid that we should be sending to
those countries
we're not addressing the crisis that he
did create which is the daca crisis
which
you know none of us are like talking
about and i'm just going to plug it in
that we have a qriket conversation
coming out when we talk about the state
of daca
yeah and we talked to um uh to jin park
who's the first daca recipient to get a
rhodes scholarship
um and so like these are the things that
to your point we need to keep
bringing back into the conversation like
what is happening to the people that are
sitting in the detention what is
happening to the
to the 3 000 families that were
separated at the border what is
happening to the people that are getting
deported right now we have more
deportations you know we have like
record
number of deportations happening those
are the crisis that
donald trump created and those are the
crisis that democrats need to
ask people in leadership in the house
now they need to think about what are
the
the bills that we need to pass to
protect those people and to solve the
crisis
that that created got it
how much more american blood
must we shed before congress does its
job
for those who refuse to compromise in
the name of border security
i would ask imagine if it was your child
your husband or your wife
okay i actually think it's worth
stopping to say
like you can argue that like one of one
of the biggest
that politics boils down to like who can
you be convinced to imagine yourself
being
and donald trump wants to talk to a
tiny a narrow sliver of older mostly
white americans
because those are people who can't who
find it much easier to imagine being
the victim of some kind of violence
trump you know you know uh uh
exaggerating the threat posed by
immigrants but of course donald trump
would never
say imagine it was you were stuck it
might you were coming up here
from guatemala escaping pain and and and
deprivation that's the immigration
willie horton head yeah and that's his
go-to for
literally every issue i was going to say
i mean daryl lynn made this point in the
thread a vox reporter on immigration um
that his his theme his one theme
political theme
since the day he came down that
escalator
has been uh immigrants are coming to
kill you and your family
that's it he did it that was the
announcement speech
that was all through the campaign
american carnage that was that was the
inaugural that was 2018.
it is literally the only political
weapon he has he has nothing to say
about anything else of substance
no matter what the issue whenever he is
in a jam whenever he is in trouble
whenever his approval rating sag
whenever he's in a tight election
immigrants are coming to kill you it is
all he has
yeah and to this sort of like point
about what can we imagine right like i
always tell people
you know as an as an immigrant like
there's no
like who in this room would risk their
lives
leave their family behind leave their
land behind leave their language behind
leave their
good food behind to travel 2 000 miles
and put their lives in danger
so that we can come commit a crime or so
that we can come get on welfare like
that's not why people risk their lives
to get to the united states which by the
way is why the statistics are pretty
clear
that immigrants commit far fewer you
know far less crime
than native born americans because
exactly what you're saying people came
here to build a life they came here to
start over and and just
we never talk we are talking about a
manufacturer crisis he's calling it a
humanitarian crisis there are
there is there is a set of policies you
would pursue if you gave a
about the people along the border if you
should immigration if you cared about
american jobs
there'd be a different set of policies
you pursued the wall has nothing to do
with any of it
he's getting to the good stuff now
we're so cruelly shattered and totally
broken it's redundant
to every member of congress pass a bill
that ends this crisis to every citizen
call
congress and tell them to finally
after all of these decades secure our
border is that a hatch act violation
this is a choice
between right and wrong justice
and injustice this is about whether we
fulfill our sacred duty
to the american citizens we serve
when i took the oath of office i swore
to protect our country and that is what
i will always do so help me god
thank you and good night so help me god
i'm about to take this hoops off
he's gotten to that point in the night
he sucks in this setting
he's so low energy he can't read for
 he sniffles like a weird scuba
diving noise it is awful
he's terrible oval office addresses are
a waste of time anyway we always hate
them they're just weird settings that
are antiquated that are from like 40
years ago but he's really bad
guys guys guys guys guys before we get
to that uh it's time now to go to the
response
by the grandparents of a bride
sternly watching their granddaughter
marry someone they hate
i mean that is that is a terrifying
sight what
what what why did they do that well
because uh basically uh
jack nicholson was having trouble
finishing his book uh
and uh he goes more and more mad and
then he is told to go to this room in
the hotel but when he's walking down the
hotel there are these two people just
standing
in the hall may i suggest the next time
there is a response to give from the
democrats
chuck and nancy maybe like rock scissors
paper over who gets to do it
but maybe you let nancy do it just let
pelosi do it she's
third in line for the presidency and is
the speaker of the house maybe let her
take this one
i love pelosi i think everyone sitting
here does but like
there are things that uh we just elected
this really exciting young dynamic group
of lawmakers
use those people they're great
communicators put them out for these
responses like that's how you lead a
party
yeah no i know i like and it's like
who's it going to be i know it's tough
just you know rockstar's paper pick it
out of a hat
or or two people at a podium or two
people a podium has never worked for
anything no i mean
it's um it's it's rarely attempted
it's yeah they attempted the rare double
perfume you know it's not a
black-and-white cookie you don't split
it
it's just gonna be a bad true detective
season whatever meme that's all that is
right their message was good it was it
was a good argument it's a good argument
i didn't hear the message because i was
so uncomfortable i think a lot of people
are gonna be
stuck on the style i it is i would say
that if you put what donald trump said
and you put what uh nancy pelosi and
chuck schumer said in front of people
there is
absolutely no question in my mind that
people would choose the more reasonable
approach
because forget the argument of the
border the it is so sensible to say
we have a disagreement about the border
it has nothing to do with
faa regulators food safety food stamps
uh you know furloughed federal employees
at the agriculture department
just let them go back to work
and we can argue about immigration until
uh you know
yeah like you leave this building once
you looked away from uh schumer's
terrifying gaze you realize that he
he painted trump into a corner by saying
like look we are happy to negotiate on
border security
but you've got to open the government
first open the government put people
back to work
get government services going again so
people aren't hurting in this country
and then we'll go to the table and we
can debate board security but we're not
going to do it
with the government which is a good i
mean and he's going to pass a bunch of
what they're going to start passing
individual spending bills and
republicans are going to slowly start
getting peeled off meaning
there's no come here the senate
republicans already like i saw
a quote from like shelley from west
virginia republican senator who's just
like
we gotta we gotta stop this this is not
gonna they're not a state that can't
afford it they are not going to be able
to hang on to this and so
now the thing that we thought was gonna
happen tonight is like maybe he declares
a national emergency so
he does it on his own he didn't do that
by the way the networks gave him
10 minutes here to save a bunch of lives
uh
snort a lot say a bunch of lies snort a
lot and
offer more than he told blacks yeah
that's true that is so rare for him to
do to do it to get the snort to lie
ratio that high
and there was no news there was zero
news everything was old warmed over
 lies that he always told before
well i am sure the network executives
who decided to give donald trump this
time despite the fact that he's an
obvious liar
and they were simply more afraid more
afraid of being called fake news than
actually doing the right thing
again and again i hope they're very
proud of themselves
because i hope they're very proud of
themselves i'm very i'm very glad that
they did not get the ad revenue they
were supposed to get
from ellen game of games end of okay
stop
[Laughter]
and when we come back dystopian hell
you
