enjoy your seafood while you can
all this and more on today's majority
report
that's right ladies and gentlemen uh
particularly a few pescetarians
oh yeah um matt chrisman convinced me i
should feel fine about being a
pescetarian because we're the last
generation that's even going to be able
to eat
fish so that's right you know that's
just yeah the noms are good
phase itself out um
and probably now i mean i think to the
extent that we get our shrimp from the
gulf coast
um it comes complete with all the
chemicals you need
all the preservatives you need without
having to put anything into it that's
what's nice about that
yeah young uh michael is back
from his extended vacation i i am back
and and uh
it was great vieques is an amazing place
and in that
top line that you just did there i
definitely feel as if i've arrived back
home no more fish
things are terrible trump is president
trump continues to be present uh pence
venezuela democracy
we've got uh we got clips of uh bernie
sanders town hall last night
and you know the the fact is he is the
um by really any measure
the um the front runner
and um i think you know things could
change i have feeling there's uh
did jay inslee uh jump into the race yet
i suspect he will
he's already talking about the um
getting rid of the filibuster in the
senate which is an odd thing for a
governor to be talking about unless
you're gonna run for president
um you would focus on uh global warming
that would be his main area um
and we will uh talk maybe a little bit
more about
um the uh
really the the protest with with um
uh dianne feinstein yesterday i mean we
mentioned it and
it is um uh
it's it's garnering uh you know perhaps
maybe a little more attention than
people would have anticipated but it is
i think uh indeed it clearly
is indicative of of
something that has struck a nerve and
um because as we get closer
to the potential of defeating donald
trump
and perhaps taking
the the senate in 2020
a climate change is going to re-emerge
as um
an issue that we can actually do
something about
to some extent it goes away
during i mean does it climate change
itself does not
the urgency does not obviously it grows
with
with time it's less of a focus
when there's a sense that you have
completely controlled republican
government because they will do nothing
about it not just do nothing about it
they will
actively fight against the um
the reality of it and as we get
now that we have a democratically
controlled house
uh that's why that debate begins to
to heat up and that's why it becomes
largely
an internal democratic debate
because the republicans are
immovable uh
on that accord and um
ultimately to the extent that climate
change is going to be addressed
in a timely fashion they're going to
have to be irrelevant to the equation
so the argument becomes between
people in the democratic party
essentially
who will hopefully have uh
a hold of levers of power and
how seriously they will will take this
and that's why
pushing dianne feinstein
to swing for the fences when we already
know
that there's not going to be any runs
scored until democrats take control
she's up there saying look what we're
going to do is we're going to try for a
single
because i've been here for 30 years and
i know the best we can do is a single
but the fact of the matter is it's not
going to mean anything either way
everything we're doing now about climate
change every argument we're having about
climate change
is for what can be done when democrats
take control
so when dianne feinstein says like i i
can get something passed
it's irrelevant anyways
passing something with the republicans
today is irrelevant
the interior department just rolled back
1700
um or provided 1700 waivers
for safety regulations following the bp
disaster
there's no part of the trump
administration or the republican
governance
that is going to actively engage in
climate change
so the the places to to fight
about this are within the democratic
party
and i guess also
on the view where
megan mccain has a really interesting
take on this
just i want you to just before you hear
her take on this
i'm just going to say her name to you
and i want you to think about that
her name is megan mccain
what the hell i love dianne feinstein
now i loved everything about it and i'm
in the minority on this
i really hate when people use children
as political props
in general i i what i thought of thank
you very much
is that there was a kid named jonathan
crone who spoke at cpac in 2009 and he
was like the new young conservative
voice
and he made cable appearances and later
on as an adult he said he was naive
he was just saying the stuff he had
heard for a long time he also said i
shouldn't have done that speech it was a
bad idea
later on as an adult and i think
children have to be able
to grow up and make their own political
decisions about what they want and
anyone shaming dianne feinstein she has
been doing this 30 years
and if you don't like it she also said
in that i won by a million vote margin
i don't agree with her politically but
she makes a lot of good she's talking
about basically the
things you have to go through but you
know i would make just one point about
this because years ago during the aids
crisis larry kramer was on my show
he was the person who did act up and
really went after people about
aids medical help et cetera
no he was the grown-up larry kramer his
famous activist
and he was going after elizabeth taylor
now elizabeth taylor was a pro-activist
she was one of the champions in the aids
crisis and he was going after her and i
said why are you picking on her
and he said because if i go after the
antis
nothing gets done i can at least make a
dent when i'm talking to someone on our
side and dianne feinstein
has an incredible record on climate
change so yes
go to her because if you go to that guy
inhofe who's holding a snowball and
thinks that that makes the point about
global
global climate change you're going to
get nothing out of it
and trump same thing i actually think
that kids today know a lot about climate
change and
and and they are are the ones that are
going to be directly affected by it my
kids know a lot about climate change
they know a lot about recycling
and i think you give them short shrift
if you say you know what they don't know
enough they should keep their mouth shut
i think my daughter paloma is 12 years
old
and she could give dianne feinstein a
list of reasons
why she should vote for her
i don't know that they're necessarily
being used as as as props and i i don't
like the way that she engages
and this is a common cheap trick using a
kid as a prop i never like it i never
have did yeah
yeah so in other words uh the two people
who are sitting at that table because
uh their dads were i was gonna say and
with that
i would like to announce that i'm
leaving the view right exactly
um i know jonathan crone uh we had him
on the show
actually uh back uh four or five years
ago couple of months before i
started and i remember going through the
the uh the archives being like
this is one of the more bizarre we well
wow
talking about him on uh on break room
live and
mocking him and i think the problem that
megan is having is that she's finding
out that
on the right they use the kids as props
uh
and you know kids are used to props in
all sorts of contexts but
in this instance these kids
it really is their future and you don't
need to be a scientist
to make the case that we have a
urgent need to address climate change
because
the overwhelming number of scientists
who study this stuff have made that case
so you can just simply rely on the 97
percent of scientists
who weigh in on this and you don't need
to be a scientist yourself
and dianne feinstein has probably done
no more reading
than i would imagine some of the parents
who are with those kids
about this oh def definitely and it's
also just such a
i'll be on brand for a second and i'll
mention south africa there's a
there's a you know a thing in there's
the anc youth league
right like just the civil rights
movement was powered
by uh you know teenage and younger
activists so like
it's very funny that the concept she's
just being disingenuous i mean
totally but more broadly there's an
important point here too
that like not only is is young people in
politics
not a prop necessarily it's actually
powered some
extremely significant things and it's
going to need to on this because
they're literally like we are to a much
higher degree than dianne feinstein
and if you're 14 to a higher degree than
us
live on this planet that's being made
about the
parkland uh well right that's another
great example of course not right i mean
so these kids were like five to six
years younger uh but the issue
is is the message they was bringing is
pretty
fairly straightforward um and
so megan mccain may have issues with the
way that she was used as a prop
at different times which perfectly
legitimate she should write another book
about it
but um i would love to read that book
good for joy behar too for making the
point that
you you protest people you have leverage
with
there is there may be some modicum
of value to protest uh people you have
no leverage with but it is really just
more for your own
well-being and to make yourself feel
good
but you protest on issues where you want
legislation
with legislators who on some level at
least
are within the the ballpark of needing
to listen to you and all the things
are supposed to at least pretend that
they have to listen to you right well
i mean dianne feinstein did not like to
be in that situation
even if she's not gonna she's not gonna
run for reelection or whatnot
but the the bottom line is she feels
some
pressure from that because somewhere in
her social circle somewhere in her
political operation
there are people who are who are
susceptible
to that type of pressure and if she
wasn't she would have just locked the
door and not had them come in at all
yeah and so uh the you know the
they feel the pressure certainly more
from their
from uh you know than had they gone down
to jane
inhofe's uh office definitely
and you know there's a certain amount of
of some psychology in it otherwise she
just you know she
i mean dianne feinstein can't possibly
be like i just got to watch my back
because of reelection
also and the ways where everybody's sort
of praising her for
breaking down supposedly of the world
works of these kids is
indicting why the world as it is
constituted does not work
i've been here for 30 years and we've
done nothing
incredible that is the most extra
and i do have to say this is a
pernicious problem with democratic party
leaders because unfortunately
republicans have accomplished a lot
accompl you know for destruction but you
have all of these democrats running
around saying i've worked on this for
decades well
okay well let me apply a little market
logic to that right exactly yeah think
about your life
think about your choices uh folks

so uh it was announced
well i guess we had mentioned it and
sort of teased it yesterday but the
full numbers came out yesterday in terms
of um
bernie sanders
a fundraising and the reason why
you know we're getting stuck on this for
uh
and i don't know we're talking about it
too much but
um bernie is clearly the fundraiser i
mean excuse me the uh
the uh the um the front runner
and um the real question was going to be
that i think a lot of people had at
least in some
uh quarters how much of bernie's
support was a function
of him being essentially the only other
candidate
in the race with hillary clinton yes
martin o'malley was there but
he did not necessarily have the um
the charisma or the foundation
to to make a name for himself in that
race and so the real question was is how
much was bernie sanders
uh a
a reaction to hillary clinton or how
much of it was
proactively bernie sanders he got 43
percent of
the vote in this in the uh the primary
election
and and look if
we had a presidential election where one
candidate got 55 percent
of the vote the other one got 43 of the
vote that is a landslide
i mean that would be a landslide now
it's the dynamics in the democratic
party are a little bit different
uh than the nation at large
so you know the the democratic party is
not nearly as polarized
uh and the dynamics as to why you vote
for someone in a primary a little bit
different than they are
in terms of a uh you know a general
election
uh but 43 of the vote that's a lot of
vote if he could retain
the question is how much of that 43
percent would he retain
does he have the ability to build on
that because
one of the things that hillary clinton
had in her favor
was a sense turned out to be
not necessarily correct but that she was
a sure bet she would definitely win
and a significant percentage of
voters probably in both parties um
vote for someone in a primary who they
think has the best chance of winning in
the general election
obviously a certain you know significant
percentage of people who voted for
hillary clinton
she was her first pick um regardless of
what they perceived as her ability to
win so the real question with sanders
was going to be
how much of that support would he retain
on day one and the numbers
are are in and they're pretty stunning
i mean we know what the polls say but
that's all well and good
sanders collected 10 million dollars
from
360 000
donors
it's an extraordinary number he i think
his total donor
list in um if i'm not mistaken
in 2016 was 2 million
but that was over the course of a year
and a half
long campaign to have
20 of those people show up on day
one is nuts
and here's what's interesting about that
too 39
of those donors used an email address
that had never been
before used to give to mr sanders now
that obviously doesn't mean that there's
40 percent new donors
some people i gave money when i was in
college
three years ago and now i got rid of my
college email address or
you know i finally got off of hotmail or
uh
you know my email account got hacked
whatever it is
there's always some churn but even if
that's
half even if 20 of the people
are brand new donors
it's incredibly impressive 10 million
dollars and just to compare it
um sanders got 230 million dollars
in his 2016 uh primary so he has
already
gotten about five percent of that total
a little bit less maybe
but significant portion of those people
committed to um
almost 50 000 donors have agreed to give
sanders
um a reoccurring donation
oh yeah i signed up for six dollars a
month because i'm a bro
well there you go one million dollars a
month
uh each so there's another almost get
you know 15 million
off the top and it's pretty stunning so
you start off
on in the first week with already
essentially having raised 10 percent of
your total
from uh 2016.
which is it's it's stunning elizabeth
warren
uh 20 times what elizabeth warren did
on her first day kamal harris did a 1.5
million on their first day um
and i think a lot of the other ones have
they even released it because i
i think some according to a piece i read
last week
a lot of the candidates have not
released these numbers and presumably
they would release them if they looked
good yeah and and
and some are divined i mean they
these fundraisers have a notion they
have a calculus
as they can tell what other campaigns
are doing close or
close anyways um and here's the amazing
part
so there was
20 donors out of
the 360 000 who maxed out
this i mean this is it's it's crazy
which means that there was
officially 359 914 donors
so 359
894
can give again i i just want to say
two quick things one is is well i'm not
going to say it's petty i'll just say
you owe me five bucks from the bet with
perrine
when i predicted bernie would run and
you did not
yeah all right uh but the second more
important point i think is
i i and i actually like i mean i think
bernie's campaign so far and i know
we'll get to it has been you know
i think ver i mean certainly not from
like places like msnbc and cnn
mostly but from people like bill
fletcher jr's example there was valid
criticisms of bernie which i think
they're
uh responding to and i also like the
idea that even that he's told his
supporters like to basically be chill
online which i think is good
we'll get that but i just want to say
that i guess the big takeaway though is
like
this is also just like listen to what
people say people are excited about this
guy because of the agenda
i mean there's a reason there's
durability here yeah
and and i think this is at least
indicative that
his um the support for him
was not merely um
a not merely a reaction to clinton
surely uh some of it was and other
people are going to go
to you know some of those uh former
bernie supporters are going to end up
going maybe
maybe to other candidates who knows i
mean the question is
has been how much of that uh 43 percent
would he retain
um could he build on it i don't know
that you need to build on it
in a race this big this many people also
i mean it's a historical tragedy for
hillary clinton but i feel like she
actually had both experiences because i
think in 2008
it was about like there wasn't really
any difference between her and obama in
terms of policy but it was like
we need something really different here
and also iraq was a really big deal
but it was very stylistic it was very
generational it had a lot to do with
where you stood and don't forget i mean
because her campaign then
uh under mark penn was you know they put
out a memo saying like
barack obama like indonesia as a kid
save that for 2040.
like they they ran on some very nativist
stuff but i think 2016 was definitely
the real sign coming out of black lives
matter and occupy and the
living wage movements like no you you
gotta start delivering for people
yeah and i think a lot of young people
who supported
uh obama in 2008 are supporting
bernie for a lot of the same reasons
after being very disillusioned by obama
and and i think well i mean i think
we'll have a better sense of that as we
go on but
clearly what is um
i think these numbers have got to scare
you if you're working on another
on another campaign um i mean there's
just no
there's just no two two ways about it um
you know i can only imagine right now
that howard schultz is sitting in a
bunker somewhere
uh surrounded with people who are making
millions of dollars to tell him that he
can win
uh soon i'll be having conversations
gotta do this i've got a teal about like
actual
bunkers and it's gonna be very
disturbing get me another double
espresso
we're gonna do this i need a thinking
session so 10 million in less than a
week
um is uh super impressive
and then last night um sanders
did a um town hall
and um
i was watching to see you know because
you know it's funny this wasn't quite uh
february of 2015 but it was in the
summer of
of of 2015 when
two or three protesters from black lives
matter
um basically rushed the stage at net
roots nation
and i remember there was a lot of
uh bernie supporters who were upset
about this and from
my perspective and i think we we we
shared this when we were talking about
this michael was that this was a good
thing for sanders because he clearly
had very little experience
in speaking to the concerns of african
americans
in this day and age and it was
early enough in the campaign where he'd
have the opportunity
to uh to to adjust and i don't know
and while i think to a certain extent
he probably um grew
a little bit in that respect i don't
know that in the context of the campaign
that he had enough time
to understand i mean i think you know
look he has a very good record in terms
of
of civil rights but i also think that
we're in a different era
and there's different uh sensitivities
and so uh this was i thought
one of the best answers he gave at least
in the context of this question
uh last night there was another uh
question where it was slightly addressed
where i don't think he did quite as well
but this one i thought he did very well
and and i'll and i'll show you why too
to an important question we have a
question from noel osama he's a policy
analyst here in washington
thank you senator sanders uh there's a
deep sense of mistrust for you by
by some within the african-american
community many feel you undermine
secretary clinton after a nomination by
not showing enough support
and which contributed to president trump
being elected along with that many also
feel that you are times racially
insensitive
and by virtue of your background don't
reflect their experience enough how do
you address these concerns and what's
your approach to winning their votes
well first of all i reject the first
premise that you made
i knock my brains out in fact i just saw
a letter today from hillary clinton
which said thank you bernie for working
so hard
in my election all right we went to
state after state i think we had 35
40 rallies in all of the battleground
states
so i do not accept for one moment that i
did not do
everything that i could and then people
say well you know some of your
supporters voted for trump
true but some of hillary's supporters in
2008
voted for mccain that's the reality more
of those did that than voted for me now
on the second point okay pause it for
one second i just want to just
add in here because this and this is
going to come up in in a different story
apparently over the course of uh
the three months after the
nomination to the election that would
have been october
uh september and august he did
39 rallies 17 rallies in the last seven
days
of the campaign so that's i mean that's
a pretty substantial
number of rallies it worked quite hard
for her
i mean but people are mad that he ran it
all
that's the reality more of those did
that than voted for me now
on the second point okay we ended up
winning
among younger people
more votes from young african-americans
latinos
asian-americans native americans
then clinton and trump combined
all right furthermore if you look at the
polling out there we're doing quite well
with the african-american community but
let me just raise an issue here
maybe i haven't been as strong on this
issue as i should be
i talk about the fact that we have a
nation of massive inequality
okay and i believe that i think that's
the most important issue we can talk
about
but within that inequality we have
another inequality
and that is racial disparity and it's
important that everybody understands
that
that means that the wealth gap between a
white family and a black family
is ten to one if you are a black mother
the likely it is that you are you
you will have a baby that will die your
infant mortality rate
two and a half times higher than a white
mother if you are a black businessman i
remember talking to a fellow in
milwaukee black businessman
said bernie i can't get a loan from the
bank
and his business is pretty good because
of
redlining black kids are leaving college
more deeply in debt than white kids
so we have an enormous amount of
disparity in wealth
in education in health that must be
addressed and i will work as hard as i
can
number one to have a cabinet that
reflects
what america is and number two
to do everything that i can in every way
to end all forms of racism
in this country and so you know that um
yeah and and i think what what's what's
particularly
encouraging about that is that um
and you know look i i i i i
you don't want to give somebody uh a
cookie for for
for doing stuff that is sort of like
baseline
but uh saying that he acknowledging
that he could have done better on some
stuff
at one point i can't remember the exact
wording but he says you know i could
have done better on this
acknowledging that he could do better on
it and
uh indicating you know that
there is a specific element whatever you
believe to be the root causes whether
you believe that it's a function of
of of class that drives racism or not
the the reality the lived reality
of people of color in this country is
that
they may be subjected to the same um
class disparities but there's a whole
nother set of disparities that they have
to uh
deal with and acknowledging that reality
is i think crucial to i mean
identifying them is crucial to dealing
with them and you certainly it's
certainly not going to happen the other
way you certainly can't
you know not be aware and acknowledge
those realities
and hope to deal with them i just don't
think that's possible um
but so both from a substantive and a
rhetorical standpoint that's a huge
upgrade bernie 2.0 there is
um is a big upgrade and that's good in
that respect
i the reason i really liked it though is
the way i mean you you covered
obviously the most important part but
the seamlessness of him
being able to totally reject the first
premise of that question which we
explain yeah
i mean it's a separate question yeah
it's a separate but it's it's inelegant
to combine those two things and it's
actually a feat to pull off
simultaneously saying that questions
total bs
that other question's hugely important
and let me sort of get to it
yeah the guy really pitched him a good
question i don't know uh
whose side the dc policy analyst is on
but it it worked out really well in the
end
yeah and and i think you know look i
think part of the um
and i don't know if the question about
clinton is is meant to be a surrogate
question for
his relationship to the democratic party
but
like you said earlier michael he's made
a point of saying
you know show some respect to the
institution
and part of the reason why i think
particularly in the context of older
african-americans i think we said this
yesterday is that
the democratic party
means something to them because of the
material benefits
that i think particularly older african
americans
are um aware of relative to you know
their their lived experience
um republicans have made it
really um have provided a very
stark difference uh for particularly
older african americans in terms of some
very
fundamental um uh rights
to the extent that the democratic party
and there certainly um
you know has um has not been
as strong as it could be i mean even you
know going back to social security let's
say
um that stuff is a little bit more
subterranean
but the republicans have been very very
explicit in their hostility
to um to people of color and
and even for what it's worth like with
with i mean i don't want to get into the
whole new deal and roosevelt and
obviously it goes without saying that
there was
huge compromises and racism built into
negotiating with southern democrats like
you said
but there's also the reality that under
roosevelt there was actually
a big shift in the african-american vote
towards democrats
so even in that time actually
yes this was the party that on a
relative scale
was doing a hell of a lot better and
that was uh registered in
uh support all right so here's another
question that bernie got
and it is um
it is uh a a similar question came
earlier
um it is uh and i think
he didn't do as well with
he did well with part of this question
not so well with one of the one of the
premises and and so
um there were a couple of stories of
what appeared to be narrow instances
of sexual harassment on the campaign
in 2016. this is
every campaign as far as i can tell had
the same problem clinton had someone
very high placed
uh in her campaign i guess who was
accused of uh
of similar um but
his response here makes it clear my
understanding is the campaign
is um taking this extremely seriously
but there was another part uh and and i
think he addressed that well there's
another part of this question that i
didn't think he did
as well he's from denver
as we saw in the 2018 midterms the
democratic party has become more female
more racially diverse and younger in age
how can a voter like me feel confident
in your ability to represent the party
especially given that your response to
sexual harassment allegations during
your campaign
is that you were quote a little bit busy
running around the country trying to
make the case to be elected as president
well i think that quote was a little bit
out of context
but let me ask you a question i am
enormously proud
of the fact that we have the my most
diverse
progressive freshman class in the
history of the united states congress
and you know what i did in 2016 and in
2018
i ran all over this country to try to
make that happen
all right so when you talk about the
political revolution you're talking
about two things
number one are the ideas that we are
fighting for
an economy that works for all not just
the one percent but the second point
that i have made over and over again
is we're not going to be able to
implement a progressive agenda
unless millions more people get involved
in the political process
so i am delighted i am glad we started
an organization called our revolution i
think nina turner is here you know what
the purpose
of our revolution was about is precisely
to bring young people
into the political process and i think
we're making some real progress
what do you mean what are you going to
do senator to make sure that the
allegations that occurred against your
campaign
a couple years ago uh are not repeated
what are you personally
going to do to make sure that that's
okay for one second all right so
um because he does much better with this
question in terms of
of the sexual harassment but the the
problem that bernie has
in addressing um that first part of the
question is
regardless of whether you think the
premise
is important or not um
the fact of the matter is the party is
far more
diverse and dynamic and changing
i don't know if it's changing uh as
rapidly as much as we're
you know there's a greater awareness um
of the party being made up of of
a vast majority of people you know a
diverse uh
group of people but but he has to
acknowledge
that's the case he has to acknowledge
that
i am aware that when democrats win
they lose the white vote and when
democrats win they always
lose the old white man's vote
and we're going to have to rely on
people who
look like this woman um to win
and he has to acknowledge the reality of
that
and then simply say and then go on with
the rest
you know there cannot be any
defensiveness about that because you're
not
fooling anybody she asked about you know
about people of color about women
and he responded with young people and
he's gotta he's got to address the
question
and and you know he's got to do
exactly what he did later in the uh in
the broadcast
um in response to you know
uh some criticism that he's gotten in
the african-american community
more more specific criticism but he's
got to be able to do that because
he i think has the confidence that his
policies
are going to help across the board
and the reality is he's an old white guy
and he's obviously he's not going to get
any younger and he's not going to get
any less white
and so he's got to just acknowledge it
and move on and
uh but for you know day two
of the campaign or day six of the
campaign i think he's in pretty good
shape
and then this i think was very good
because they have some they
clearly have a specific um
a specific apparatus that they are
have developed or developing to deal
with a sexual harassment on the
campaigns
a couple years ago are not repeated what
are you personally
going to do to make sure that doesn't
happen again i'll tell you what we have
done and what we are doing
i was very upset to learn what i learned
uh when i ran for reelection in vermont
in 2018 we
instituted i think maybe the strongest
protocols
against sexual harassment and that will
be the protocols we bring into the 2020
presidential election every employee of
mine
in this campaign will get significant
amounts of training to understand what
sexual harassment is about
anybody who feels harassed will have an
independent
uh entity to speak to outside of the
campaign
and we have hired some of the best
people in the country
to help us on this issue we take this
issue very very seriously
um you know i think this is a uh you
know
i i don't think campaigns have had to
deal with this in the past
women have had to deal with it probably
the entire time
campaigns themselves have not um had
any type of formalized apparatus as far
as i can tell to deal with any
you know um employee issues like of this
ilk
they just haven't felt like they needed
to and it's good that they now realize
they do
and there should be formalized uh
systems for people to deal with this
stuff
and it's good i mean i i frankly think
every campaign they should be
we should be able to go to their website
and
see what their you know
obviously not the specifics or it
shouldn't be too granular but we should
see like
hey this is a process that we have that
is institutionalized within the context
of our campaign
we have you know a some form of human
resources function to deal with this
because inevitably stuff like this comes
up
uh in the context of of of campaigns
um what's the third clip is venezuela
um but let's go to uh
should we let's do just venezuela one
more time
we'll we'll finish off this uh the uh
the town hall and then we'll go back to
the uh
to the tucker but um
right now the tucker yeah the tucker um
us government
yesterday uh instituted new sanctions on
venezuela
we've already had fairly crippling
sanctions on venezuela
since um really the beginning of 2017
instituted in part i think by the obama
administration
now uh it really depends on who you talk
to
um as to whether
this was the um
this was the catalyst for
problems in venezuela or more like an
accelerant
and uh my sense is it's an accelerant
just because
of of the of the timing of stuff but
timed with that
i think there was also a uh within
venezuela
private industry who also wanted to add
an accelerant
uh to this the whole idea being that
maybe they can collapse
social uh civil society in uh venezuela
and weaken maduro um bernie sanders has
been
criticized
and his foreign policy apparatus within
the context of his campaign
have been criticized for
parroting the administration lines
that uh maduro is undemocratic
that he's problematic et cetera et
cetera don't forget
authoritarian authoritarian word
imperialists love to use to discredit
socialist governments in latin america
yeah i mean but i think there is you
know uh undeniably
a strong argument that uh
maduro has uh been
somewhat undemocratic
there is um i think
wide acceptance that there were
the election his election was highly
irregular not his first one so i just
second
second re-election yeah the re-election
highly irregular
uh there's a lot of people who argue
that his move
to dissolve the constitution uh
also highly problematic
he ran on a platform of creating a new
constitution and won
i would just say i want to just can i
just say something really quick on this
because maybe we can tease it out but i
would just say like ava gollinger who i
do respect and i've done a lot of stuff
with
is not only is she close i mean she
literally was a legal advisor to this
government
and in her book you know she concludes
and she's
extremely aware of what the united
states is doing and
some of the elements of the bolivarian
movement that maduro has clashed with of
course now critically supported but she
basically says at the end of the book
like i'm not going to go into details
but like
yeah the corruption is incredibly deep
and it's really gone off the rails
including like putting contracts on
people
so there's actual problems there yeah so
i mean and that's not the front burner
at all of the conversation right now but
it doesn't you know we don't need to
paint a fake rosy picture
exactly exactly and but there so so
there's criticism
there that um that articulating
those ideas though um is
um you're you're simply parroting what
the cia is saying
as a way of laying a predicate for
going to uh war or some type of like
various forms of of either military
or aggressive other types of
intervention now of course when we have
um when we have a
uh you know uh a sanctions regime
that we have now against venezuela we're
already
being you know highly interventionist um
and so there's some who say that it's
not enough to be simply against the
military intervention
um here is bernie
addressing that question and it still
won't be satisfying to uh to some on the
uh on the left because it is
acknowledging that there are problems
with maduro and some people don't want
to do that
we have another question i want to bring
in chanel saldana student at american
university here in washington
she's from pittsburgh good evening in
light of the recent events in venezuela
you came out against u.s intervention a
contentious stance as many in venezuela
are currently suffering at the hands of
maduro through starvation
and violence and it is clear that he
will not let humanitarian aid in
under these circumstances and moving
forward do you have a clear position on
u.s
intervention overseas both economically
and militarily
for nations that are under the regimes
of these oppressive dictators
thank you good question
there are a lot of awful things
happening in the world and what's going
on in venezuela is terrible
the economy is a disaster people are
living in hunger and in fear uh
i strongly believe there has to be an
international humanitarian effort to
improve lives for the people
i think the evidence is pretty clear
that the last election in venezuela was
not a free and fair election
and under international supervision i
want to see a free and fair election
but to answer your question let me say
this
i am old enough to remember the war in
vietnam
and i was as active as i could trying to
keep the united states from going to war
in iraq i was in the congress at that
point
and i am very fearful of the united
states
continuing to do what it has done in the
past as you know
when they know the united states
overthrew a democratically elected
government in chile
and in brazil and in guatemala and
in other countries around the world so
as someone who fervently believes in
human rights and democracy we have got
to do everything that we can
but i think sometimes you have
unintended consequences when a powerful
nation goes in
and tells people uh who their government
will be
so my view is that whether it is saudi
arabia
which is a despotic regime or whether it
is venezuela
i think we have got to do everything
that we can to create a democratic
climate but i do not believe in u.s
military intervention in those countries
why do you senator why have you stopped
short of calling maduro with venezuela a
dictator
well he i
i think it's it's fair to say that the
last election
was undemocratic uh
but there are still democratic
operations taking place in that country
the point is what i am calling for right
now
is uh internationally supervised
free elections i mean i
you know i don't know how
much better uh you could answer that
question or i should say
from my perspective anyways i mean the
idea that
you can both say that like the the
situation there is bad
um it is hard to get um
it is hard to trust international
efforts now
i mean particularly in um you cannot
trust that aid convoy that a
convoy is absolutely a trojan horse for
military u.s
aid is just the cia and has been
condemned by the red cross
yeah being too politically compromised
but even you know
even an international response now is
somewhat suspect
because of what took place in libya but
the problem is thank you marco rubio
yeah it's not like one of our
own lawmakers tweeted a direct threat to
kill maduro right and and
um let's be clear the mandate from the
u.n what had nothing to do with regime
change
um and to a certain extent
we may have by blowing through the the
un mandate
destroyed the ability for the u.n to
sort of respond
in a measured fashion in these instances
um and uh my support
at the time for the libya um
uh bombing anyways uh was predicated on
the idea that
the u.n had determined that there was an
immediate
narrow threat to uh of of a genocide
of a mass killing in benghazi
um but when the
essentially the uh the western forces
the allied forces
um overstepped that mandate we lost
china and russia
for future um such uh you know
stop you know attempting to stop like an
imminent threat
i don't think there's anything like that
in venezuela right certainly there's no
threat to us
but i don't think there's no and just i
mean i just think it's just i know
you're not saying this but just because
of how the propaganda machine is it's
like
the harshest critique of maduro that's
based in reality
is not even it's in a just totally
different universe than what was being
alleged to have happened in libya i
don't
see how anybody could look at not even
remotely venezuela
as like um as more oppressive than
what's going on in saudi arabia every
single day
more frankly more oppressive than what's
being wheeled out
frankly by bolsonaro and also what's
going to be more oppressive than
unfortunately a very
right-wing opposition i mean i think
this is another thing too that people
also just need to get used to
situations where it's not like this
isolationist oh it's over there whatever
don't think about it
but there are definitely scenarios where
there is not
a there's no morally satisfactory
outcome
and in some ways the american need i
think that like oh well
what's our answer to this is problematic
in and of itself this is because our
answer is always
coups and invasions and in latin america
right wing dictatorship
so why don't we just ease out of this
and if you want to as a citizen or in
the en
or in the actual ngo sector try to have
solidarity in sport
great i mean people are still traveling
to venezuela right now
this is i mean this was this was the
same what we heard
in in syria from like 2011 maybe 2012
uh for three or four years and the the
answer is is that
um just because something is broken does
not mean that united states can fix it
in fact and this is this is like the
this is the sort of the more sincere
response to it right
this is the last cynical uh version like
there's no intent
for the united states to fix it the
intent is for the united states to have
hegemony over over the situation but but
even if i was to take like
the the most sincere thing which is that
you know
we want to help people sometimes you
just can't
a finer point i'd like to see put on it
and the cnn town hall probably not the
place for it and i do think bernie would
be the best on this issue but
he talks about military intervention and
what about covert intervention or the
cia like what about you as the president
are you gonna do to get the cia under
control
the real response should be we're not
going to intervene
we're not going to intervene uh
militarily we're not going to intervene
you know covertly and we're not going to
intervene
with the sanctions regime now the
problem with the with the sanctions
regime is
is that there may be times where you
would want to use sanctions
right i mean yeah in very targeted ways
i mean the ones on venezuela have been
unremitted and punishing and they have
tried to
and i'm unclear like as to why well then
they can say it's a failed statement i
mean yeah they want
it i mean there's no i know that what
i'm saying like i don't understand like
what is the argument
that we're trying to like what is
ostensibly the justification well the
extensive justification even under obama
has been that venezuela's some like
uni yeah and that's insane
and it was obviously under chavez it was
i mean
again not that he didn't have his
problems but he absolutely
not only won his elections he crushed
them and was
hugely popular was putting in low-cost
heating oil into the northeast
as some type of troops no interest loans
to haiti and helping people in the
caribbean and and that's where people do
need to look at it and be like
no obviously that's the part where and i
and i think
actually and i forget who made this
point it wasn't me but i cannot
recall the name i i think there is
something with
the the illegitimacy of
capitalism or whatever you know
a certain kind of faith in our system at
home
and the way trump is going to miami
and pulling up all of this like
operation condor years politics
because it's not just venezuela i mean
if they go into venezuela there's talk
about
pushing to cuba i mean they're this is
very very aggressive and it has to do
with
re with that sort of getting back into
that like trump supposedly always says
like
panama was easy like why can't venezuela
be like panama
and as somebody said about the invasion
of grenada it was great tv
and so that great precursor of trump by
the way
on the last election um the u.n
would have been there they would have
been there observing it but the
opposition petitioned them
not to go because they did not want
anyone to say that the election was
legitimate
and also it's really hard to find
accurate information about this in the
mainstream media this is one of those
situations where you're not going to
find an unbiased source
so at least you should be reading
alternative sources for balance
yeah uh definitely
venezuela analysis and so on but i would
say and i think but even people who are
like
like greg wilpert who helped found
telesur and his wife is a venezuelan
ambassador i think to ecuador
you know hill and is that the real news
now but he'll say like yeah i mean
when maduro didn't fix the exchange rate
that led to huge problems with capital
flight and capital problems with this
government like you know again we can
of course read alternatives oppose
imperialism
and the best critique inside the
government comes from within
from people who are legitimately
committed to that project
yeah but they're marginalized right now
that's the other truth yeah i've been
trying to make this case to some of my
leftist friends that bernie is
definitely the best
viable presidential candidate we're
gonna get on this issue
by a lot um while still acknowledging
that yeah some of his tweets
sucked and he maybe he knows it maybe
he's playing a game
maybe he just needs to learn more about
it but
you know when you say oh you should be
letting in humanitarian aid
um you're ignoring the precedent
that countries that want to overthrow
your government
that aid is not just aid you know that
that was really wrong stance in my view
like substantively but i think when a
hundred percent but i think some people
are getting really off the road like
when matt dusk tweets out the whole
question of why you won't condemn a
dictator is a game that washington hawks
play to reaffirm intervention and status
quo and bernie won't play it
that's like calm down there's a lot of
really important work being done here by
the democratic front-runner right that's
a big deal
you would not have heard you say that a
democratic front runner
uh in any uh
in any campaign say
we were instrumental in overthrowing uh
the government
of half a dozen uh latin american
countries
i mean also uh
the only one to speak on the lula case
democratic front runner progress wow um
so maybe one way bernie's gonna
distinguish himself this time around is
also by his foreign policy well i mean
he started getting into you know
like even like initiate but at least his
the his acknowledgement of the history
of the u.s foreign policy
has already been sort of like a dramatic
um
uh change all right let one last clip
because this is um
uh funny because it's involved tucker
carlson there was a
a hit piece that was put out about
bernie that was a really funny uh
piece uh i mentioned earlier that
bernie sanders attended uh 39
rallies uh in the last three months of
or in the general
election you know three months of the uh
in support of clinton
um 17 rallies in the last seven days
there was a politico piece put out
that quotes um
four or five one named
and the other anonymous clinton campaign
staffers
saying that ex-clinton staffers slam
sanders over private jet flights
and the story uh was that
the clinton people apparently were upset
because uh sanders wanted
uh charter uh planes and uh let's read a
little bit from this uh during
okay so um according to
uh here it is i'm not shocked says this
guy
that while thousands of volunteers
braved the heat and cold
to knock on doors until their fingers
bled
in a desperate effort to stop donald
trump
uh his royal majesty king bernie sanders
this is a quote would only be very regal
would only dane to leave his plush dc
office
or his brand new second home on the lake
if he was flown around on a cushy
private jet like a billionaire master of
the universe
said zach petkanus who is the director
of rapid response for the clinton
campaign
who um
does not know the value of subtlety when
trying to sound legit
um and it comes out the sanders campaign
preferred mode of travel quickly emerges
a point of tension according to six
former clinton staffers and another
source familiar with the travel
senator ended up flying private
it's actually charter i don't know what
the distinction is but
on three separate now listen to this
here we go on three
separate multi-day trips in the last two
months of the campaign all right so
three separate multi-day trips
prior to working out the logistics of
sanders travel
quote our working assumption was that
ninety percent of the time it would be
commercial said another person familiar
the matter
if he was trying to hop from city to
city in a particular state and
commercial didn't work we were open to
chartering a plane
so they anticipated ten percent of his
travel
would be on charters
they have a quote from uh sanders
spokesperson saying it would have been
possible to do all this and then later
in the piece they say okay
uh sanders held 39 rallies in 13 states
on behalf of clinton's campaign
according to jones
17 events in 11 states in the last week
alone okay
forget about that i'm trying to kill it
i've
we actually have some numbers here and i
did some news
i mean i did some math i should say
which is news because i did some math
so 39 rallies right
presumably let's just say one rally a
day
they had 17 rallies in seven days so
they did
uh two and then one day probably three
two days three over the course of those
seven days
so there were um you had 30 days
of him actually going out taking plane
travel
now it's back and forth so it's really
more you know trips than that
but let's just say 30.
he took a um a a private jet
on three days now according to my math
three equals ten percent of thirty
in which case what they anticipated
which was 90 of his travel would be
commercial
actually happened they wrote a four-page
story
ultimately that bernie ended up
traveling
by charter in the exact percentage that
they assumed that he would
wow wow i'd like to fly high play
put me in a socialist jet i'll pretend
to support hillary
but it needs to be the best
put me in the high plains fly around
here take me from vermont any
win
but this is what it's going to be
there's going to be a series of
hit pieces from people who are upset or
worried about bernie and they're
all and the narrative you know
apparently
they're going to end up having to find
another narrative because
that they anticipated bernie would only
use
chartered jets in support of clinton's
campaign
ten percent of the time and then do an
expose
that shows that he used um
uh chartered jets 10
of the time is just not going to further
the narrative
well it's great that there are so many
conflicting narratives against him right
because he's being attacked by the right
and the center
and they don't tend to work together at
those two sides
so like if anything this is gonna help
him in the primary
with people who are concerned he didn't
help hillary enough indeed
now the attack on bernie for for
supposedly using um chartered jets
in support of of campaigning for hillary
clinton
uh yes he's attacked as supposedly a
a hypocrite to his socialism
or democratic socialism as he as he made
a point of saying in the cnn thing the
other night
um but tucker carlson also enjoys it
because
it's it's more part of his like uh the
elite
are our hypocrites this is a segment he
wanted to do with rutger bregman yeah
this is the one he wanted to do with
rucker bregman
uh where it's like oh he'll tell you
that we have a problem with global
climate change
but he took a chartered jet yeah i bet
he wears a coat in the winter too
exactly here it is so they say it
a lot they demand that you repeat it
they require that you believe it they
attack you
if you don't any evidence of doubt makes
you a denier
but do they themselves believe it that's
an interesting question and rarely asked
when he was campaigning for hillary
clinton in 2016 bernie sanders
repeatedly demanded private
jet access for his himself and his
entourage
over the past three years according to a
report in politico sanders has spent
almost 350
000 on private flights how can you
justify that if you believe the world is
ending
because of climate change all right so
that's the premise and so
it's like entourage jeff weaver bernie
sanders todd devine
jeff is vinnie excuse me obviously
birdies vinnie so they uh
tucker uh brought on uh um um
mark green and not mark adam green
friend of show uh head of the uh p
triple c or co-founder of the p triple c
i think they
is his title um and i think he's uh i i
think they're
you know a warren folk over there at the
p triple c
but uh nevertheless here he is basically
uh telling tucker
you're ridiculous tucker and tucker is
having a tough time lately
with guests who don't agree with him i
feel like something's going on maybe
with tucker that he's
lost a little bit of he's lost a step am
i hitting a wall
point is that if you believe that carbon
emissions are destroying the earth
that's too many houses that's too much
consumption that's too much carbon
you lead by example why is it the people
who are trying to control
my life and tell me what i can do and
can't do it how many kids i can have
don't bother to restrain themselves
again that's not silly it's true
it's silly it's a fake apost hypocrisy
argument you're basically saying that
you know
if you believe that facebook has bad
privacy policies you shouldn't check
facebook every day
if you believe you want a better job you
shouldn't know what i'm saying if you
think adulterously
tens of millions of jobs in the future
in clean energy of course
he should spend the last few days of a
campaign doing everything he can to
fight for a green view you
should reduce your own emissions no it's
really simple you should walk
because all you want is power
you make better that's the most amazing
just
get out of the game all he wants is
power it's so obvious
just like so on is it just the sneering
sociopath
cable news star like what happened to
tucker
liberal like political
this is like that it's also like the
best dressed with all due respect that
i've ever seen
like like this is the power guy like all
you want is power that's why you
decided to become a bold you know just
start a group called bold progressive
yeah and we're targeting what happened
tucker that he lost
like he lost a step like that's where
you go to like
after like if you feel completely i mean
let's tell you this in parenting right
like
you don't go to like threaten to take
stuff away because that
that that communicates to the child that
you have no power
and tucker's doing that when he's like
all you want is to take over the world
did you hear how he shoehorned in uh
having kids to that
too like maoist bernie with the one
child policy
well it's actually uh it's green who
wants to keep people from having
children
is idiotic you just said he should he
should walk from vermont to dc
obviously you don't believe that
obviously don't believe sorry he's not a
hypocrite for doing that i'm sorry i
can't
tens of millions of new jobs in the
clean energy economy this is what this
is idiotic what you're saying
because look you will just have you
should watch from from myself or your
leaders you just said you're dumb
you should walk from vermont to dc i
asked the keith walk you said yes
come on not a real argument you got me
adam you got me you're a brilliant guy
thank you so much
i appreciate it we're going to um
pictures apparently
oh my god he was so mad
so mad unbelievable there it is tucker
carlson
all right let's just uh quickly uh check
in uh with adam green adam
so adam green uh welcome to the show uh
you did a good job on
tucker carlson was it fun thank you it
was very fun it was a blast
yeah and do you anticipate that he will
have you uh back again
uh probably no right
all right thanks adam there you go so we
got where
power hungry out of green right there it
reminds me uh luke mayville there's a
freedom idaho
uh luke mayville uh who you know who's
doing work for to expand medicaid
there's medicare in uh
idaho medicaid uh medicaid expansion
idaho they're accusing him of
leading a band of agitators on twitter
so right
right no two scary guys well right
because what happened was was that they
passed it overwhelmingly overwhelmingly
through referendum and now the
republicans in the state house are
trying to kill it which basically
subverts the state constitution
and so luke is doing luke who like
teaches like john
adams at columbia is tweeting things
like
respect the will of the referendum
agitators all right folks i'm gonna head

i've spent another just an
abnormally long time just fishing around
software that
just because i'm fascinated it existed
um let's go to the
ims also got that reuben one right there
oh yeah okay though um megan
mccain birdbrain michael welcome back
show is not the same without you sam
with respect to bernie i'm hearing a lot
of performative not another old white
guy proclamations
against my annoying liberal peers some
of whom supported him in 2016 what's the
best way to combat this racist aegis way
of thinking
well i would start with do not perceive
it as racist or ageist
it seems to me that it is i mean i don't
think it's a
um a deeply thoughtful uh criticism but
i don't think the vast majority if you
will check chapter
like two of my book blame the electorate
of the electorate actually thinks that
thoughtfully about this stuff
and the fact of the matter is there's a
lot of reason
to say like i don't want uh an old
white guy to be president again there's
some ageism going on though come on
i don't think all the people who are
like oh he's so old
oh there's well listen you can say he's
so old but the fact is is like i don't
think there's
there's a question i mean younger than
when nelson mandela took the presidency
i don't think it's a question of of his
capacity
as much as it is is that there is a a
sense um that this is what we've had
for presidents um
the vast vast majority of our presidents
have had this profile and i like i say i
think it's a superficial uh assessment
but i don't think that it's a ageism or
or racism yeah i guess we could
disaggregate the ageism from the other
stuff
and and i i think i think what you say
is
um that's the case but i also happen to
think that his policies
um are going to provide the most
opportunities
for um
for the type of diversity we want in the
future i mean
barack obama's winning of the presidency
did not it certainly made a difference i
think probably
to um uh to
to all like young people in particular
and to you know i think a broad range of
americans in terms of what's possible in
this country
and i think that was helpful but from a
material perspective
um i think there's an argument that um
it didn't
help one wit and
um and so
i think the idea is that it would be
great
if um if
you know stacy abrams was positioned
like bernie sanders and had bernie
sanders policies
um uh or you know but
these are the options that we have and
of those options i think you know in
terms of the most transformative change
transformative change brings about other
transformative changes
um and so i think from that perspective
that would be my argument i mean i think
there's i i think there's a perfectly
legitimate reason to say like
we need you know it is helpful for
a multitude of people in society to
um see someone like themselves
rather than um
someone who is quite similar at least
you know
on the surface um being a president i
mean i i'm quite convinced the reason
why we have marriage equality today was
simply because of like
you know will and grace and or ellen
i think that i think that we probably
have i think that growing up today
gay as a child is
far um um
far less traumatic maybe it's not even
traumatic at all
in in some instances you know or you
know broadly speaking
relative to the way it was like 30 years
ago um
because there were public role models
you know i think that's it's not dumb to
care about representation
right like i too would love to see a
woman president
i think it's bad that we haven't had one
yet
but and like all things being equal i
would much prefer
someone who's not a white man but all
things
are not equal and there's nobody else
with the policies that bernie has and
the perspective that he has
so that's where i'm at
right uh
alba mccain's right kids shouldn't have
to protest and get arrested to push
adults to do something about climate
change
adults should do something about climate
change so the kids futures aren't effed
uh waterboard from cashmere does anyone
else think the lion king's message is
kind of messed up
what is mufasa teaching simba by saying
all land
the light touches will be yours sounds
like he's teaching feudalism and the
whole story about circle of life about
lions eating animals and providing
fertilizer for grass to grow for the
prey
sounds like organic free-range version
of trickle-down economics i mean the
lions are on top of the food chain
they're on top of the pyramid what uh
mike mike racine did a bit about this on
his podcast
oh he did yeah i was just gonna say it
sounds like somebody workshopping a
stand-up bit
yeah he literally did like uh him
holding him up and like
i don't remember the movie sounds like
ronald reagan's probably uh taking uh
taking somebody's material wait ronald
reagan i am that well i don't know it's
water boyd from cashmere but i gotta
think that uh
right now uh ronald reagan is probably
watching lions king
uh with his kids i think we're around
that time i'm just dead i see no it was
just
it was funny no they did a whole bit of
like him holding him up and surveying
the kingdom and i forget
like what the bad animals were in that
movie but him being like simba
you can't help them because that will
only make their problems worse scar was
right
uh turn up vega sam i think it's
important that we point out substantive
distinctions between
bernie and warren one of those is that i
feel warren's political ideology is
somewhat muddled
for instance if you believe there is a
wealth inequality problem in this
country and that we should
combat that by building various
entitlement and welfare programs and you
go ahead and vote to raise the military
budget by 700 billion dollars
over 10 years then i worry about where
you stand
i mean i think there's an argument that
um you're saying that extra 70 billion
dollars could have gone to other things
i mean i think there's an argument that
you could do both but i know that the
end
progressive tax rates are the most
integral part of getting the programs we
want but cutting military is
spending is also important and moral
imperative i i think the progressive tax
rates i mean i'm not sure
exactly but they're not just to raise
money they are
to reduce the price reduce inequality
yeah
megan mccain's
baby fat i think you guys might be
underestimating the child
the challenges of child prop like megan
go through growing up megan's seemingly
lack base of historical
facts and knowledge can be directly
correlated to the number of campaign
stops and photo shoots she went on
after all that sacrifice what does she
have to show for it
um speaking of campaign props
you know um
this is uh where who is she talking i'm
not sure sorry it's not on the sheet i
couldn't
you know uh ivanka sat down with uh the
dude from fox news digital
and uh dude from fox
you know that guys
yeah steve hilton that guy and um
she uh she sat down to just talk about
what she's learned on the campaign trail
i don't have a description is he a hotel
hilton
oh this isn't on the sheet yeah here we
go
you've got people who will see that
offer from the democrats from the
progressive democrats
alexandria ocasio-cortez here's the
green new deal
here's a guarantee of a job and think
yeah that's what i want that's simple
what do you say to those people
i don't think most americans
in their heart want to be given
something
possible what about you
put aside look listen we can go with the
low-hanging fruit here
okay that she works for her dad
and almost every single job she's had is
either work for her dad
no no i'm sorry let me recalibrate that
every single job she has had either is
working for a dad or a job that her
she got because of her dad
so she's answering the question
uh what the green new deal is going to
have a
job guarantee a job guarantee and she's
saying i don't think why americans want
to be given something
like a job i for one i would
also not like to have a job but uh but
in their heart want to be given
something
they're i've spent a lot of time
traveling around this country
over the last four years people
want to work for what they get so i
think
she didn't even hear that you didn't
even listen to the guy's question it's a
job guaranteed that's what they're going
to do they're going to work
but they don't like to be given a job i
think
people should have to work to get a job
none of these kids
have his charisma it's incredible but
i've been traveling a lot around good
what they get so i think this idea of
a guaranteed minimum is not something
most people want they want the ability
to be able to secure a job they want the
ability
to live in a country where there's the
potential for upward mobility
what what what now it babe
no i'll tell you something
honestly the fox
the fox news uh digital guy you got to
give him credit for just like
maybe they don't cut back to him for a
reason because he's just sitting there
going like
that was all they uploaded that's not
what i said
that's not the question that's okay uh
there's guaranteed minimum
yeah there it is our next president of
the united states
after uh donald trump um
let's go to speak that into existence
let's go to uh
let's since we're we're um with the
dim-witted
um apparently dave rubin
is in uh sydney australia uh he's having
a conversation with john
anderson and um
an american politician named john
anderson yeah he ran for
uh he was a independent who ran in um
oh 1980 i think it was uh carter and uh
and reagan
okay but different dude different dude
um
they're in sydney jordan peterson dave
rubin
dave is going to explain what's going on
with the left
now okay because the left it's like they
think they're oppressed but they don't
know what real oppression
is why do we walk away
from people we can trust warning us of
the consequences
well i think there's an interesting
reason for that that sort of brings the
sultan it's in story
into 2019 which is that he
was truly oppressed this was a life
of actual oppression right now
we have people that are walking around
everyone in this room has this in their
pocket
and if you have this positive i should
tell you that he's pulled out
not a card that says i'm not oppressed
he's pulled out
a cell phone we got room has this in
their pocket
and if you have this in your pocket and
turned off i hope yeah hopefully it
turned off but if you have this thing in
your pocket and you think you're
oppressed
you're very confused we we live in a
time with such absurd freedoms in the
west
that are so uh beyond imagination of
what people could only dream of
two generations ago even one generation
ago especially with this
that people now are have a perceived
oppression instead of a real oppression
so one of the things that i find
does he think that there are no cell
phones in the east
i mean he said like we what we i don't
know well hey hey
not only is not only i'm looking i in
fact i am looking this up
right now because i did want to buy your
logic kit
and i believe china has the third
highest concentration of cell phone use
in the world
number one they're super super
non-oppressed super freedom qatar the
united arab emirates bahrain
saudi arabia ultrafine trying
so hard russia's up there if you've got
a telegraph in your community you're not
oppressed
well you know i don't know the number
but i know that a lot of venezuelans
have uh cells
so okay okay
[Laughter]
i'm just trying to understand i'm just
trying to understand what his
what what what point is he trying to
make
he's so dumb he's saying it's like the
same argument as like oh
poor people have refrigerators now so
they can't complain about anything ever
like if you have access to certain
consumer goods which are now very cheap
to produce
you can't complain about economic or
political oppression
but with wha was the problem with
charlotte nietzsche that he that he
didn't have like a phone
like i don't understand like they took
away all of sultanate's
communication privileges okay we'll
continue hearing this if dulcineaston
was alive today
he would be on rogan maybe he'll do it
maybe
why right the most insufferable
interruptive he'll be
let's see do you see let's see if he
does a reset because i just wonder like
what everybody else in the room is going
like
what people now are have a perceived
depression instead of a real oppression
so one of the things that i possibly
incidentally i should also say i'm sorry
but uh like one out of every four of
dave rubin's tweets
is how youtube is unsubscribing people
from him
and we'll get to that because
but but like literally like every third
tweet he puts out is a complaint to
youtube that he's being oppressed
that his subscribers are being underdone
or that
patreon is not doing it right or the
technology companies are
but go ahead of two generations ago even
one generation ago especially with this
that people now are have a perceived
depression instead of a real oppression
so one of the things that i find when i
go to
uh when i go to college campuses is that
you know these kids will protest and
they'll scream
and that you know that everyone's
alright and everyone's uh neo-nazi and
the rest of this
and i i always find all right well how
do you how do you break through to
somebody like that how do you actually
when they have you know you've talked
about this when they have that look in
their eye
truly a possessed look and and they're
you know it's
this this post-modern monster has become
sort of a secular religion
uh and i think that's also one of the
reasons why what jordan's doing is
resonating because
they've they've removed religion from
the positive for one second look at
jordan peterson's face
do you think like these they're both
looking at him like i just wonder like
what's going through their head like
peterson's just
like i'm making so much money it doesn't
matter
don't this up for me yeah and the
other guy's going like oh my god
jesus how many followers does he have on
youtube
lord what's going on in america no
meaning and they put it all into this
really competing set of ideas uh
what we call the the oppression olympics
where they're constantly competing for
oppression because they believe that
victimhood
is virtue and victimhood of course is
not virtue what's virtuous is
getting your life in order and going out
and doing something so i'm always
looking for a little trick
to get through to these kids and it's
really hard because when they have that
sort of glossed over zombie look it's
it's tough
and i found one trick that actually kind
of works if you can get it to them
in in the most simple personal way and
this particularly works in the united
states and i have no doubt that it would
work
here in australia as well i'll say to
them anyone in this room
does anyone in this room have it worse
than their grandparents
now i've done this i don't know 100
times probably nobody has ever
raised their hand nobody ever if you
live in the united states you
basically short i mean the only outsider
case would be if your grandparents were
oil barons or something like that
and then they lost all the money in
which case in which case the leftists
would actually love that too because it
would show that
well it would show that that accumulated
wealth doesn't stay beyond generation so
they're all about that right
so what yeah that's the whole point of
the leftist argument is that sometimes
fortunes are squandered
[Laughter]
anybody sitting next to him looks like a
galactic like intergenerational let's
just let's
just one more one more this room can do
it like can everyone picture their
grandparents
do you have it better or worse i mean
does anyone in here have it worse than
their grandparents
and that shows you that it's a perceived
depression not a real oppression
i mean first off generationally speaking
uh
your generation is uh making less uh
you know relative to the cost my
grandparents just got back from a cruise
so they're doing pretty well
well but but your grandparents when they
were your age when of course they had a
house
yeah i mean yeah when they had a house
i'm doing considerably worse than my
grandmother well also also
the other point but that's not that
doesn't mean that you're oppressed
but the i'm doing better than my
grandparents because i'm following you
but here's
our journey but uh but the uh
but no the other thing that i i just
i this really irritates me because
this like the premise of all of these
right-wing arguments that it's like
if you can't point to another time in
human history that's better than now
when coupled with like the blind
devotion to technological innovation
it's like well how about you just
drop a little bit of that into the
political and economic realm and there's
this whole concept of the idea of like
things actually getting better yeah i
mean it could just be bad all the way
through
really question as to whether these
people that he's performing in front of
all perceive themselves as oppressed
but uh why is he up so obsessed with
college campuses
all these people like leave the children
alone
we will we will get to the the uh the
colleges are the hop
i mean because this is this is just like
a a genre of
of of grift on the right like i get
older they stay the same straw man
here is uh here
is dave rubin again
claiming to be oppressed by youtube on
twitter
portion of an email i just received from
a viewer who i've gotten to know
personally who's a highly competent vc
guy
not a bot or a fake account and he
writes
hey dave hey dave hadn't seen your
videos in a while
search for them on youtube and sure
enough
i was no longer subscribed to your
channel uh
i am 100 sure i did not unsubscribe why
would i do that
uh this is getting creepy and this is
not the first time
either i also found that i was
unsubscribed from and then he cut that
off
uh so maybe it had a problem to do with
him but but but dave makes it about
himself
hi team youtube getting more of these
than usual i would be happy to email you
but i don't have a human contact at your
company
after six years and almost a million
subscribers despite constant
unsubscribes
this is the biggest whiny a
self-oppressed
uh i've never seen this and then
then it all becomes clear on dave
rubin's uh reddit
[Laughter]
i'm the one sending emails to
dave about not being able to watch his
videos on youtube in case anyone's
wondering laugh my ass off
is that you sam no it's not me that's a
genius
there you go that's why dave that's uh
mystery solved that's why you're getting
more than usual because there are people
already
making fun of you if you have a youtube
channel and you think you're not
oppressed you're very confused
exactly right like this guy's so talking
you have a phone you're not oppressed
youtube channel likely you are exactly
it's unbelievable how this guy moves
through the
like just the world
completely unawares honestly like i
i really my there i think there's some
some grifters out there
who are conscious of their grift but i
really feel like i don't
know dave is just so um
unself aware and just guided by
where he smells the money and he just
thinks that's
truth right he's in the jet stream
that's basically what it is i mean but i
get and maybe if your grandparents had
an oil company and they lost but but i
guess the left would like that because
they like what great
when dukes and barons gamble away their
fortunes at casinos
that's what big elections yeah the only
way i can conceive of an older
generation having more material wealth
than younger generation or some sort of
weird oil bearing scenario
i always ask i always try to be fair so
i always ask ben shapiro about the oil
bearings
i i am quite convinced when he gets back
when he gets back from this trip there's
going to be a lot of like wow you don't
really realize how hard you're hit by
the jet lag
[Applause]
really that jet lag was really tough
really tough
oh my god
well there he is huge success on youtube
folks welcome to it yeah the cream rises
to the top
exactly i just when we yeah in a couple
of months
where the tmbs youtube channel wasn't
being monetized right it's a
fraction of the size of reuben's frat
like and i'm
you know it's not huge but you know
obviously paying somebody to do it
actually just like losing money i don't
and we yeah we said we out of
eventually and we didn't even allege a
conspiracy we were basically just like
this is
 they're cutting their cucks go
bother them on twitter
but i didn't i mean this guy does seem
to spend
like a very significant amount of his
online time or like
you and me think homophobia talk about
youtube's hurting me feelings of
oppression that's
all i mean like you know we've talked
about this many times
how aggrievement seems to drive uh
the conservative mind now i know dave is
he's in a gay marriage he's
he's against the death penalty he's not
really going to work he's very
begrudgingly pro-choice but he's getting
he's having to uh
to to uh qualify that because liberals
are pro-murder outside of the womb
and uh and he used to be for
single-payer until he found out that
would
that was at odds with uh the smaller
government there was other but then i
read
it yeah i didn't realize that i didn't
read it i didn't dig into that
i was in a really serious i was in a
john stewart mill
marathon and i was just i was thinking
so hard because i was just engaging in
the ideas
and then it just my buddy brett was
telling me that every green state is
making
uh conservative students turn in their
phones at the beginning of the semester
to impress them
all right and so speaking of college so
then after i read jared's student meal i
didn't support
giving people vouchers to buy uh
insurance anymore which is of course
single-payer
there there's there's two
there's two groups of people in the
country who
have the most self-aggrievement possible
and do it under the guise that they are
aggrieved because of how much
aggrievement other people feel and that
is of course
um almost anyone who identifies
as conservative or a classical liberal
and comedians who uh for some reason
can't get booked at uh
colleges anymore or don't or college
students don't like their comedy
and so of course of course it's not oh
they don't like my comedy they don't
think i'm funny it's that
society has gone off the rails because i
don't get the same amount of laughs at
colleges that i used to with my stale
material
um well we held this uh
for today because michael's such a fan
of uh
the bodega boys i love these guys but
they now have a um
a show on show time right it's a nightly
show no it's uh
thursdays yeah it's not yeah it's like
once a week yeah oh yeah
and um that would be exhausting and
they uh so they they're on this what i
don't what is this
this is hot ones a complex magazine
where they eat sort of spicy food and
talk there you go so uh here's the
bodega boys
on hot ones um talking about
pc culture and their
comedy is um not pc
not pc
so for years you guys have rift on
trending topics on a hot mic
without much of a filter why do you
think you've avoided the problematic
police at least in a big pr disaster way
is the key
desist to just say allegedly and qualify
everything that way
um i think it's more we self-centered
yeah there are certain things you know
that you could have gotten away with
saying an o9 that you should not even
formally as a sentence in your head
don't even put it in your drafts okay
what i'm saying don't even
don't even try it if you watch the
progression of our comedy there's
certain jokes we used to do that we
won't do anymore
because as we've experienced the world
and we've come across different people
we realize that the humor hits
differently that a certain joke that
might have been funny four years ago
like you actually meet a person from
this
specific group and you're like oh
like i didn't even know that was
offensive oh
like guess we were from the bronx just
like i suck my dick and all that
but we're not in the crosshairs or pc
culture like that because
we're not like fighting against it like
we we're not we're not out there like
oh pc cool you can't see what you want
anymore
now you can say what you want you just
got to be funny about it i'm like smart
about it and approach it the right way
and don't just say something for shock
value because that's what a lot of
people do a lot of people were just like
oh you're offended
oh i i triggered you sorry he's like
triggered you libtard
you're like and you know like we say
there's people who are selling out
arenas doing that but it's just like
at the end of the day what's the what's
the expectancy on that how long can you
do that for
i mean the all of the stuff that they're
saying
is really fairly basic but somehow
seems to escape the vast majority of
well i shouldn't say the vast majority
of communities the vast majority of
comedians are fine it's just like
but the the ones that we hear piercing
through the biggest complaints you know
jerry seinfeld
uh when he's not driving around you know
showing off his fleet of cars
is complaining that colleges are just
they don't like my gay
king what's that anymore like it's just
it's unbelievable
that's what's so funny about it though
is like on it it also just shows the
the real the misunderstanding of it
because i can guarantee you
that listening to a bodega boy's podcast
if one were to
listen because i do think that there are
uh scolds
if we want to use that word and they
exist in all quadrants
there are there are people who i would
say are are lefty squares who are
annoying about this stuff i
make no bones about it they're obviously
people who are religious people who are
right-wing people
whatever and people who have legitimate
gripes as well
no that's not what i'm talking about but
if you listen to bodega boys you will
find
infinite more grounds to potentially get
uh
you know bothered by something than
anything
jerry seinfeld has probably done other
than you just sort of being like yeah he
just kind of seems like an
right like that's what's he's not
hitting not because of what the terrain
he's going after he's not hitting
because a 19 year old is like
you mean that like eating french toast
makes you gay and that's like
you're not the 14th like what well
what did you play what was it so you're
not allowed to make fun
of anybody ever
it also depends if it's coming from a
place of good faith or bad
faith right that's partially what
they're saying yeah
yeah i think i think their empathy
their empathy uh you know and where
they're coming from from
comes through i mean i i think that
they're i think one of the reasons
i mean you would know this better than
me sam because i didn't i don't know as
much of the show as you but i think one
of the reasons that howard stern has
kind of survived is because
he wasn't like like he was
very problematic whatever the word you
want to use but he didn't seem to have
like a kind of malicious dimension to it
well it was also and it was satirical
there's a certain level of trust
that you build with your audience when
they feel like they know you
and maybe they'll give you the benefit
of the doubt and if you ever
do say something that maybe oversteps
the line
or hurts people's feelings like you can
have the
critical distance on yourself to be like
all right maybe i shouldn't have said
that
right i don't think the problem is that
um
i don't think that the idea is that
people should
the people should necessarily
self-censor
all the time so they never step on a
landmine it's how you react
to when you find out that this is a
landmine which is what they're saying
there's so much context involved too
like i've talked a lot about this with
uh jay flores the comedian
and podcaster and friend uh like so much
of it is con
contingent on context and on who you are
and on where you're coming from like
louis ck
people used to give him the benefit of
the doubt and now they don't anymore
and there's no going back right and this
is not a concept that escapes
comedians at all i mean whether it's the
the
the broader context that some people you
know you go up you see a stand-up you
don't necessarily know anything about
them other than what they're presenting
but you have a
you know their visual cues um and then
there are other you know the context of
the jokes and whatnot
but the the bottom line is like this is
nothing
this is nothing new and the idea that
some people find some jokes offensive
and some
don't on others and if people
in society are becoming more
aware of the sensitivities of people who
are not
exactly like them like there's always
been you've always had the sensor to a
certain extent
uh you know white sensibility or a
certain like you know narrow
sensibility um it's just that it was one
that was widely accepted and
unchallenged and to a certain extent the
sensibility is broad that people are
just more sensitive to what other people
are sensitive about
and so you know
the idea that this is in some way like
inhibiting comedy
this is a perfect example of why that's
not the case
um let's go to the phones we got a
little time here
call him from a 571 area code who's this
where you calling from
571
i mean i hear that person breathing they
fell asleep
asmr uh calling from a 708 area code
who's this where you coming from
uh hello sam this is dragonflyer19
calling from the chicagoland area how's
everyone today
dragonslayer19 how are you what's on
your mind
i'm pretty good i just wanted to quickly
promote uh two things
uh first off the annual socialism
conference
i just announced some details uh so
everyone should hold the date for uh
july 4th through july 7th uh it's being
held in chicago
um it's a conference uh if some people
might remember that
jamie 1 2 last year has a lot of good
topics like
labor history marxist traditions
clear activism and one of the great
things last year was
hearing from a bunch of the teachers who
organized and
participate in the wildcat strikes and
so a bunch of leftist best people are
going and uh hopefully others
will go and if you want more details you
can check out socialismconference.org
okay it was very very cool i actually
found multiple guests for the antifata
from all of the uh
interesting talks that they had there
uh are you going this year that's a good
question
maybe appreciate the call dragon slayer
one more thing spam okay one more thing
um so the other big thing i wanted to
promote and i feel this is somewhat
criminally
unpromoted as long time listeners of the
show will know
that uh there's a freaking caller named
ronald reagan
yes and what some people might not know
is that ronald reagan has a podcast
called redirect immigration law
perspective it's excellent that he uh
co-hosts with a
immigration attorney named matthyar
jimbo
now in addition to all the great content
that they have providing context on like
lots of stuff on like immigration law
asylum cases refugees
what like the border wall would actually
mean is uh they recently put up a goal
for
having if they can get a hundred patrons
they will take on a pro bono asylum case
from the northwest
immigrant rights project now literally
as i was on hold for this call
they just reached 100 patrons now it's
great that they're able to reach this
goal but i think that the mr
audience
[Applause]
[Music]
but the mr audience and associated
people can get that goal at least to 200
300 or even 500.
okay so i want everybody to go out and
join
patreon.com redirect give some money to
raygun for a great cause uh you know
mindy shares some stuff sarah silverman
i saw that you shared
a video of mr lately if you could
promote this that'd be really great
because that's like the power of
independent media is
us sharing it joining in great causes
like this so anyways
thank you for the time left is best
thank you dragon slayer
uh the it's patreon.com
slash redirect i am a uh proud
and enjoying patron and
just really i mean immigration law
did you just what happened to your sorry
immigration law
uh and the broader immigration system i
mean is one of the most important things
happening in the country today obviously
i like the celeb interviews
yes uh the celeb interview is great
calling from a 266 area code who's this
where you call him from
266. hello
hello hello hello hello hello
can you hear it can you hear me yes can
you hear me
yes you can hear me yes oh right you
said 2
266 that's not my area code so i assumed
you referring to somebody else
well that's all about that skype 266 is
usually a skype number
uh that doesn't matter for my mobile in
the uk okay
um okay right well i just wanted to say
i completely agree with
what jamie said yesterday about means
testing
um i don't disagree i don't i didn't
disagree with the idea of means testing
but it is just simply not the definition
of means testing
to have a sliding scale all right
they're testing your means though
well i understand but means testing
means something
specific kind of a pedantic point like
you know what i meant
well but anyway that's just a slight
side comment um i've been meaning to
phone you and talk about the crimea for
a while where i've spent a certain
amount of time but
that does not unfortunately appear to be
the priority at the moment
i've i phoned you once before regarding
allegations of sort of anti-semitism in
the labour party and then there was this
recent
elano martin that you guys had
and um i've really been trying to get my
head around this
and i kind of would appreciate your
insight
because i'm not jewish you're jewish you
probably have a better insight than i do
but i'm trying to understand what
thought process is fundamentally behind
the kind of perspectives that that some
people
sort of from the jewish right i suppose
you'd call it have
and the only thing i can understand i
mean this is very simplistic and crude
is that it must relate to the holocaust
and that this idea that
israel is a jewish safe haven it's a
place in the world
where if the hits the fan if
there's another hitler
jews can go and be safe right so if you
criticize israel really what you're
doing is attacking jewish safety
you're attacking uh you know uh
and i haven't had that frame to me
exactly that way
by people sorry
yeah i mean uh and if you're attacking
jewish safety well then you're being
anti-semitic you know
and so really criticizing israel i mean
this is the crude presentation right be
deemed as anti-semitic
now now obviously if you're
terrified that they're out to get you
you know and that you're
wondering every moment that there's
going to be some sort of nazi who's
going to grab you and do something
horrible to you
then i suppose it would make sense that
you would be defending israel
with everything you've got you know now
so i mean i don't know i mean maybe
that's a really crude simplistic
approach attitude and and maybe it's
more to do with
tribalism and nationalism i don't know i
think it's i don't think they're
mutually
i don't think they're mutually exclusive
and i don't think they're necessarily
the same for everybody but i think for
certainly
a percentage of of
for a small you know and i think it's a
relatively small percentage now
uh and it gets smaller i think with
with greater distance from the holocaust
but i think there's definitely
um i mean i think that perspective is is
accurate
i also think in some instances it's just
race
you know jews can be racist uh as well
uh anybody can be racist right exactly
and uh so but i
but i you know i think i think that is
from the
from the right i think that is a um
i i think that's a good assessment yeah
i have had several conversations with a
zionist friend
who i love very much but our world views
are fundamentally
not reconcilable and you know a lot of
these folks are liberal on other things
and he is as well but
when it comes to that you end up
justifying all sorts of atrocities but
he says
jamie you don't understand we
anti-semitism
is one of the oldest forces in the world
he has this trans-historical view of it
and you're we're we are never going to
be safe
and that's why we need a jewish state
with nukes and tons of military aid
yeah but this idea of destiny of
is very dangerous you know we're
destined to be persecuted
i mean that's almost a mythological
perspective
rather than absolutely i mean i mean
yeah i mean there is i mean look there
is it's not hard to find
a you know historical precedent right i
mean
yeah but there it is there's a material
basis it's not just this evil that
lurks in the hearts of humanity well
it's been
quite quick i mean coincidental i mean
over
over uh it's not a question if there's
an evil that uh
exists in humanity but that material
basis has crept up you know
throughout centuries i mean so there is
i mean i think there is listen i think
there is
um uh there is you know
some precedence it's not a completely
irrational
uh fear uh i mean it's not like
anti-semitism
right i mean so yeah yeah i mean i i i
think
i think that doesn't mean that they're
acting upon it in the correct way but
but go ahead so what what what's your
point oh
was that it my point yeah was that no no
no i have plenty more to say
i mean i mean i suppose i mean it would
seem to me that the root of a lot of
anti-semitism just simply comes from the
fact that jews have been a minority
in many countries and minorities are
always persecuted
it always has been historically so uh
and minorities you know have different
identities whether they be gypsies or
jews or whatever
uh and yeah people persecute minorities
um i mean that's
human societies and so i i'm not sure
that it's
i think it's dangerous to view it as
something that's intrinsically must
and always be some about jews that they
will be persecuted i think that's a very
no no no i i mean i think
i think i mean i think you're right i
think it's it's it's
um i i think it has to do with the
minority
status but i think that there's a sense
that among
i mean i'm not i understand i'm taking
devil's advocate here right
i mean i'm taking a position that's not
just like mine but i think like
um jews are always going to be in the
minority uh significant minority
um they um the
to the extent that they have power in
society
there's also a lot of precedent for them
having power in society
uh nominally speaking but not enough uh
to
to uh change things to to stop
uh something when things go south
essentially
when you know when when uh things take a
bad turn i mean this is
this is part of you know uh purim is
coming up um
in like uh uh like a week i think or two
and that's the story of purim right like
you know well-positioned
jew was up there had to save the jews
from all getting um
uh uh killed you know uh
by uh you know uh by uh haman i think it
is i mean i i'm not quite up on it but
um it's been a while but i mean look
yeah but this is this is there is a
there is a
uh there's a narrative uh i don't know
that it's
you know to the extent that it's unique
narrative
it's that it's uh documented you know
whether it's not uh you know these are
not notarized
documents but uh there is a there is a
history that
um and and part of the jewish tradition
is to be well aware of the history so
the sensitivity is there toward
to it as well so in today i mean in
addition though to the obvious point
that of course while all of that is true
that
you still have to be able to just talk
about a nation state objectively
i really wonder i mean like
i think today and i'll just put this on
the table because it's a much broader
conversation but like
if you were in some type of situation
of needing to return to israel like
let's not create some ultra dramatic
scenario but like
oneness may be more plausible that you
wanted to leave a place like
i don't know france i'm not even sure
about that frankly but
let's just say that but you still were
maybe you were even religious but you
were pretty left and you
had some you know were had some sort of
values that might have been
reflected potentially at least in a in
in a certain view of israel from the 60s
or 70s i mean
israel today like what netanyahu just
did in terms of like the coalition
partners that
even more extreme parties my point that
i'm getting to in a long-winded way is
i don't even think you could think of
israel as a state that is
in any way remotely for all jews today
yeah
it's such a far right such an
increasingly
narrow place yeah yeah with its own like
internal i mean no i mean look it's a
free speech laws i mean
this stuff is is the guy who uh joe
cramer i think wrote a book about how
the occupation had traveled home
and i just i think it's like not only
untenable obviously first and foremost
with the occupation but just like in
terms of what it even represents
for i mean say just like left
or cosmopolitan no if you're living in
an eastern european uh town
of course a few jews of course left
there burning you know
well no doubt about that no doubt about
that no doubt about that but that's why
i picked them more
that's why i picked a more kind of
neutral example yeah and that's where
ethnonationalism
always leads you you can be and this is
why
if i were ever going to pull a dave
reuben and decide to be a right-wing
youtuber and
get paid for it uh that would be the
most believable route that i would go
get into zionism which is fundamental
fundamentally incompatible with
socialism
right because if you believe that
humanity is fundamentally there might be
others who have a different view of that
well no
like if you believe the founders of
israel if you believe
that humanity is fundamentally true
socialists who founded israel
may disagree a little bit oh my god
yeah you think about the documentary um
our gentiles friend is still listening
to this jewish
boys are everywhere
is this like
there's a documentary called the lobby
uh an al jazeera documentary called the
lobby
about the uh it was based on the article
from the labour party
in the uk oh no i didn't know about it i
found it i mean it
have you seen that anymore no
hello no i haven't read it yeah well
it's on youtube you can find it on
youtube just uh look for the lobby
and it's quite interesting because it's
it's you know
what you call it not undercover but you
know it's an investigative reporter
and it's all really uh sort of you know
live filming
right so it's all primary evidence and
it was just
interesting because it might i mean i i
mean i only thought recently but give
some insights about sort of allegations
of anti-semitism in the labour party and
you know i mean my my father's a labor
party member
and he goes regularly to meetings and i
mean
his sense is that this all this
discussion of anti-semitism and the
labour party is so closely related to
the question of israel
yeah i think that's i think that's the
case
well all right listen i appreciate that
can i finish what i was saying earlier
which is that if you believe humanity
is fundamentally tribal as zionists do
you believe that socialism is not
possible
the brotherhood of humanity is not
possible anyone who tries to do it
is going to cause a atrocious bloodbath
the best you can hope for is to take
care of your own people
and that's why zionists end up going
down some very bad roads and supporting
some really atrocious right-wing
policies because if you really believe
that
um then anything the state of israel
does is justified
appreciate the phone call well i
if you believe that uh that there's a
fundamental tribalism
that anything is justified yeah if you
believe
the most important thing is taking care
of your own people
then it it has very bad implications and
it's
a huge reason why um it's not just
that jeremy corbyn you know liked uh
anti-semitic
painting on facebook by mistake like it
goes much deeper than that
and the zionist critique of socialism is
like a very fundamental one they cannot
be reconciled
i mean the socialists who uh
who founded israel probably had some
at least um uh basis for their
perspective that that there were certain
tribalistic
uh elements going on wasn't that sort of
like the nationalism conversation like
certain nationalisms in this
like i guess the third world nationalism
you'd call it being anti-imperial
power like you can you can make the case
for a nationalism in that sense
there's great but there is oh there's
ultimately there's a road
yeah there's greatness like yes i find
it much more understandable
when people are nationalistic response
you shouldn't like i i i more on your
side of this but you just i wouldn't
like declare what something
is or isn't in like a categorical way
when it just manifests in
so many different ways including by
people who identify their own projects
as that
i think that's where the tension is like
i think there's no doubt
that the vision of those people who
found it
i would even suggest the majority of
people who
who founded i don't know if it's fair to
say the majority but certainly a
significant percentage of the people who
founded israel
i think their vision has gone off the
rails
and maybe it's because you can't you
can't establish um
a uh a country with that agenda
well i think it's more i don't hear i
think it's more material israel
i think it's more of an interior right
you can't it's because
it was fundamentally off the rails
because fundamentally it required
the uh uprooting well that's this place
where i was just about saying
okay if they'd founded israel like in
you know with all due respect north
dakota right uh i think uh or you know
he wouldn't displace matt's grandparents
and he would have a better life than
that i think more jews should know about
the missouri river
but to extrapolate it even further like
nationalism
has got it's a negative force in the
world i mean i think broadly speaking
and we're never going to get socialism
if everybody's
a nationalist and no matter where you
are i think you know the nationalism of
imperial powers could go
first and then maybe the nationalism of
colonized peoples that arose in response
to that
could go second yes i mean i i think
that's probably
one of the reasons why i don't think
that we're going to get the type of
socialism that you're talking about
um but who knows maybe
maybe when we're all orbs i'm not sure
i i'm going to convince you someday yes
when i
when i am not of a bot like i'm just a
floating orb
i mean i'm just i guess it's slightly
cynical about about humanity in that
respect
calling from 405 area code who's this
where you call him from
hey it's gregory from oklahoma gregory

democrat and be a zionist but so hard i
mean
whoa did you hear that sam she just she
just really
she flipped the script on that right i
forgot being a socialist
anxieties you can't be a democrat of
your zionist bro
yeah getting bars what
mindy i love you that's what go ahead
i'm sorry i love you too
i mean it's such a cult that when they
like
all they they have companies that
recruit children
to go to birthright like it's their
 birthright they're americans
they're not as wilyites i mean my kids
everybody my kids
knew had to go on birth rate when
they're 25 they all had
they went once they went twice my son
called me from
israel he said i don't get this
they're like sleeping in the desert
like it's hot there's camels it sucks i
want to come home
anyway so that's my that's my israel
story but no it's a cult
i believe it's a cult do you think it's
a cult i mean i think yes
i think at this stage um
we're in late stage uh zionism i think
is
is is pretty problematic
um i mean i think it's pretty
problematic
right so that's my feeling on that the
other thing is i
understand and i'm happy for all you
guys that are loving your bernie
and i think if bernie gets the
nomination
i believe that everybody will jump on
the bandwagon
and he will win over trump and i get all
that
but i'm torn because i'm a woman and i'm
a middle-aged woman
and i want to see a woman president and
i think
that some of these other candidates are
starting to adopt his
policies and i don't like think
okay so yell at me i want a woman
right i mean
which one do you think is most mimicking
those policies
elizabeth warren yeah and if
and if um and i know you're really down
on kamala and i get it
but they're pushing them so far to the
left
everyone is pushing them to say things
like yesterday
camella had to say that trump was a
racist like she had to publicly say it
i mean we're pushing them so far to the
left that i think when
this whole thing gets done and we do
have enough
candidate i think they're not going to
be a middle of the road
moderate like a joe biden i think we're
pushing them
very far to the left and i think that's
a good thing all right
the only thing i would say is i think
it's i think it's a perfectly legitimate
um obviously i mean desire and i think
it would be helpful to have
um a a a woman president
and um and certainly you know like um
i think it's important for for women
frankly and i think it would have a
um you know to some degree a
um at least a step towards you know a
material benefit for women
but when you talk about pushing them to
the left understand it's like it's sort
of a it's a two-step
process right it's one thing to get
people to uh
position themselves in the context of a
campaign
uh to the left and it and i definitely
think that that has
some um some actual material um
uh implications but
uh you got to take that next step and
you know
the the depth of that um is
is a function of a how strongly people
are
you know um how strongly the the
the constituency continues to push them
and how
you know how how much of that
constituency
is interested in pushing them so in
other words if you're a kamala
a supporter okay and you are happy
that she's being pushed to the left on
these issues you also look around the
room
metaphorically at your other kamala
supporters
and ask yourself are they going to be
here
after she's elected to continue to hold
her feet to the fire about these things
and that you know that is
a function of how much she's going out
there and not
following on these positions but leading
on them
you know some certainly will have a
residual
you know um obama did not run
on marriage equality he we ran against
it
um and he was pushed he was not
promoting daca when he got elected he
was pushed
but you know in these broad-based sort
of he was scared to do anything
he was scared to do anything yeah i mean
he
just i don't think it was just he was
scared i think in those instances
actually to be honest with you
in those instances the ones that he
changed
i think he was initially scared in fact
you know
i mean i i was it was supposedly off the
record but at this point i don't think
it's really terribly relevant but uh i
was in a a
a room with him and about 10 other
people when he was talking about that
very issue of marriage equality
and um for him it was a calculation
and i think he was scared but and i
think uh
that uh pressure you know
changed him and gave him courage but i'm
not sure
you know on things like the banking uh
you know on on the way that he responded
to the banking crisis
i don't think he was scared i think he
just was listening to different people
and had a different world view
and so you know the it's it's
those type of things that um i think
where there's that hesitation but you
know
it's you support kamala you support uh
bernie i mean people make their own
assessments no no
i really want a woman like
i don't want tulsi albert i won't vote
for her
i mean i don't know the whole thing with
amy klobuchar right now
i mean she just sounds like a but
like
what the um
the only thing they can come up with is
that she ate a salad with a comb
after the fact to like soften her image
for like throwing
binders and chairs at people getting
people getting job offers rescinded
which is really evil
he was a bad boss so mandy i agree with
you
like i was saying earlier i also want to
see
a woman president i think it's bad that
we haven't had one yet
um but i also want single-payer health
care
and you know ultimately a national
health service i also
want a job guarantee i also
want all these really good progressive
uh i guess social democratic programs
and i think bernie sanders
is the one who's the most likely to get
us those things
and part of that is because he
understands
you know he's always talking about how
change real change comes from the bottom
up not the top down
and you know his whole slogan is not me
us and
you know obama talked a lot about that
stuff too but bernie really means it
and i think he understands that better
than anyone
and i think this is something that's a
sort of hard
socialist left can a lie with the
liberal left on right now because we all
want the same reforms
and he also knows that if you want to
get anything halfway decent you have to
shoot
really high so for all of those reasons
um i'm and foreign policy is is a whole
other thing on which he's much better
than warren but for all of those reasons
um i just think he's the best choice
right now uh i i
i for one will uh not be
um uh unhappy at all if uh elizabeth
warren ends up being
uh the nominee um there's a lot of
policies of hers that i
um i like and i think in terms of
i think you know more than just about
anybody
at least off the top of my head in the
the race
i think she in terms of like
actual functioning as a president
in terms of executive skills um
i think she has shown her skills in that
arena
more than anyone else frankly um yeah
yeah but camel is faking everyone out i
mean i don't know she's faking everyone
out but
she seems to be the one look i don't
care if it's warren or camilla
i i don't care i i would like a woman
bernie
i mean a jewish old woman bernie would
be great i mean
but mindy what are you trying to tell
she wants bella abzug to come back from
the dead right
are you uh are you trying to announce
something right now
no no no no no no really with the stuff
well actually i was going to say with
the stuff on my path i couldn't get
elected but then trump got elected so
yeah who cares i'll be right back
everybody all right well listen mindy
and i'm not that old
at all that was what i was going to say
mindy you mean you want to make a fresh
start as a dynamic
young congress yeah this is a justice
democrat yeah
mindy when you're ready when you are
ready to announce make sure you do it
here
all right gotta gotta jump i appreciate
the call love you guys
bye michael bye bye jamie hi we love you
too
all right a couple iams and we're out of
here uh
congressional baseball fan these people
attacking bernie for a few flights sound
like they could learn a thing or two
about things that fly
and they start with catching a few fly
balls out deeper
secret identity politics hello is this
me this one's for michael if pointing
one flaw in his argument is enough to
make uh tucker loses
what is mark blythe doing i really like
blyth and i get that he's spreading the
good word but is this regular gig more
valuable than exposing tucker as a
nervous jordan peterson's face
is uh
telling dave rubin to get his bloody
name out of your mouth you lip lick
spittle
thames darwin welcome back sam at all
i've been missing the live show on
mondays this semester since i have a
class until 2 30 that said i've been
making
a pretty clear observation of a serious
problem confirmed by the presence of
blake on the line when i left class
yesterday
so my request is this can you screen the
calls to put the douchebags on while i'm
in class at least on mondays otherwise
love the show
chris lopaco amy klobuchar eats with a
comb
yellow snatter i'm still mad at reagan
for stealing my thunder
uh by having the nerve to invade grenada
on the day i was born
yellows oh yellow snow eater
uh brother from brooklyn i think bernie
has blind spots regarding black specific
policies like reparations i saw a clip
of him dismissing a black woman who
wanted further details on his stance on
that
psychedelic quaker can jamie provide a
source for her claim that opposition
leader prevented the u.n from monitoring
the venezuelan election
uh yeah i believe i saw it on reuters
reuters south uh
china sea lol nobody remembers jim webb
mission complete uh dk in chicago hey
guys it's election day in chicago our
mayoral
election is crap shoot but the anyone
but daily there are also four great dsa
challenges for city council along with
the great incumbent carla rosa plus
amaya power is a front runner for
treasure explicitly on the issue of
creating a public bank which is huge it
could make
waves nationally great uh michael from
uh
m.a is there something fitting about
conservatives and hillary staff trying
to use the same type of attack on bernie
that was attempted on pelosi and al gore
kwame bequested uh omigee you guys are
so damn much please never leave again
oh i missed you so much omg okay tmsb
is my jam or tmbs uh when is new
when is new dork coming back from
vacation we'll see about that
uh turan galia i can't make that out
i love sarah palin bernie didn't have a
good response to wolf's point on taxes
if we're raised uh tax avoidance would
also increase
as an alt-centrist capitalist that's why
i think we should hear out schultz
before we make a final judgment on him
he said one of his greatest
biggest issues is tax reform we lose at
least between 20
200 to 400 per year because of tax
avoidance and tax evasion
well here's what you would do here's
what i would start fund the irs
the amount of cuts that the irs as a
policing organization
has uh suffered i don't mean locking
people up i mean investigatory
has been shocking so the idea that if we
raise taxes
more rich people are going to evade
taxes i have a solution for that
it's called fund the irs yeah and don't
take howard schultz at face value when
he talks about tax reform
belief all right
that was a joke train boy have you
talked about what's going on in israel
with bb forging an electoral coalition
with the far far far right kahanas party
we haven't
uh adam from philadelphia pick up the
phone if you don't you're a coward ah
just kidding
uh i will do it next time sorry
and space ghost climate denialism is
everywhere people can swear up and down
they accept scientific consensus and
climate change if they're not willing to
accept policy solutions
fitting to the scale and urgency of the
problem then they are in denial of the
problem period
right folks oh oh sorry uh vote for
nomiki if in your new york city it's
election day today
