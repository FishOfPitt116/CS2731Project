it is landed on the electric scooters
that are everywhere oh yeah yeah
hey guys twist they're great
wait a minute I saw people who said boo
now clapping yeah yeah yeah you want to
see a sheep right a scooter the those
scooters are great and I owned electric
scooter when I lived in the District of
Columbia because at first I had a bike
going your bike in DC in a suit you end
up disgusting
then I got an electric bicycle they had
a little motor on it but then I lost it
at 17th and L but thought I locked it at
16th and M and then I thought it was
stolen and then four months later I
happened to be at 16th and L I was like
aha my but it was stolen it was
right here the whole time
but by then and it snowed and rain it
snowed and time had passed and just a
rusted old hunk
so in the interim I bought an electric
scooter and it was great and I like to
believe that a Jewish gay liberal and
Darwin t-shirt riding through the gates
of the White House on an electric
scooter he bought on Amazon to write
speeches about Don't Ask Don't Tell and
universal health care was the rebuke to
somebody mayor Pete Buddha judge a man
running to become America's first gay
president with a straight haircut mayor
Pete Buddha judge a presidential
candidate running on the platform of
reminding the teacher she forgot to
collect homework mayor Pete Buddha judge
a man who thinks he could be President
despite the fact that the word but is in
his name him mayor Pete Buddha judge a
13 year old boy is currently in a Zoltar
wish machine situation near feed Buddha
jet a precocious Boy Wonder who's
getting college credit for his
presidential campaign mayor Pete booter
judges a presidential candidate who
shamelessly panders to the white
working-class by speaking seven
languages and being an accomplished
concert pianist mayor beat Buddha judge
the presidential candidate with Anita's
handwriting mayor Pete Buddha judge who
is like Robocop except the scientists
were trying to build a jeopardy
contestant and finally mayor Pete Buddha
judge the only gay person Mike Pence is
sad is going to hell I don't even know
what we're booing all right we love
mayor Pete
it is megan has with a very heavy hand
landed it on falling asleep on the couch
kind of stop falling asleep on the couch
and and I I think there's a lot of
people out there in this hectic world of
ours quite secretly falling asleep at
night on the couch for reasons that are
kind of confusing like like you know
that it's time there's one you know you
know it's time to get ready for bed
you know this you know you know also
that you've not been following the last
10 minutes of homecoming or the last 10
minutes of the baking show you know that
you're losing at your eyes are closing
you're falling asleep and yet you do
this thing where you're like it's good
you know like it's fine
like I know it's bad I know that I ate
the last bit of chocolate covered
cashews and it is gross but it's also
fun I'm gonna fall asleep here and it is
the worst sleep and we do it
again and again
I'm looking at a lot of people who do it
it's one of the darkest secrets in
America right now because we're so like
there's too many people to respond to
there's too many texts you miss there's
too many things you had to get done
today and every single day you fail and
that last step of going to bed is the
admission it is the admission of guilt
that once again you did not forward the
mail from the old person who lived at
your house
and they're never gonna get that Etsy
package and what is in there what's in
there you were supposed to send that
today is too specific speaking of Obama
Trump voters apology not accepted
face what you did you have given us Paul
Ryan you have given us Scott Walker and
and you have given us Donald Trump two
of your main exports are dairy and
 let's just be honest we're
caught a bit flat-footed by what
happened here in 2016 I feel like
everyone here was pretty surprised when
they woke up let's admit it but I
knocked on a couple more doors
all right we wake up on that Wednesday
November 2020 and Wisconsin shits the
bed again
buckle up you'll never see me again and
Tommy and John may want to come but I
won't let us the people we have needed
to figure out what the is going on
are the worst people in the
world we got we got our morosa on Big
Brother talking about nuclear
proliferation got Michael Cohen who got
his law degree in a mezzanine level of
chez Stadium you might find this
hard to believe but when I first met mr.
Trump I was blinded by his charisma and
handsomeness I felt I was I fell under
his spell and now I stand before you
were new and different man who recently
found out about this thing called the
criminal code listen I bet it all on
taxi medallions like five seconds before
over I'm so
unbelievable
there are two kinds of people in this
world people who think lox and cream
cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel is
gross and people who have tried it cuz
let me tell you something I was born on
the Upper East Side of Manhattan
don't say stop to me it's true
I was raised
surrounded by bagels my first memory is
of bagels every day the morning begins
with bagels you open the freezer there
are bags of frozen bagels because
sometimes you buy too many bagels and
you freeze them because you go to the
deli and you say give me a dozen a mix
Yom Kippur is coming you know what
there's gonna be for dinner there's
gonna be bagels so no one tells me how
to eat a bagel love bagels and
cinnamon raisin bagels with fish on them
is delicious yes cinnamon raisin with
tuna is good cinnamon raisin when the
whitefish salad is good cinnamon raisin
with lox and cream cheese in a sliced
tomato is delicious and if you tell me
that fish and cheese and cinnamon and
raisin stuck together that's wrong I
don't want to be right fish and raisins
are good
spit it again it is landed on
Millennials killing Hooters fakeness and
I want to end it on this one I debated
this and it's a true coincidence that
this happens to be on the board
my parents are here tonight good job
Robert love it do you remember when I
was maybe 13 or 14 and you took me to
Hooters
[Applause]
guess what it didn't work
oh what a Hail Mary that was and I sat
at that table and remember it's a
high-top table and given my size as a 13
year old which is proportional to my
sizes of 36 year olds I remember where
my eyeline was and it was hooters height
I remember sitting there in silence and
I remember turning to you and saying I
want to weep and then we went to White
Castle and we ate in silence so r.i.p
Hooters and r.i.p to all the wonderful
experiences of dads taking their
soon-to-be gay sons to Hooters
and that's our show
[Applause]
