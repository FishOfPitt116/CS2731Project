there is a big controversy
i guess there's nothing better than you
know like
full-on wasps telling jews how to use
the word concentration camp or something
like that
i've come across this a bit uh online
but of course there are other
jews who who want to score some
political points against aoc
and uh um feign a certain righteous
indignation
so uh i don't know what context it was
maybe it was an instagram thing
where um alexander ocasio-cortez was
talking about the concentration camps
that we have
at the border and uh what they're
used for is to concentrate
they're not prison camps because we're
not allowed to put these
immigrant children in prison camps
but they're not dormitories because
they're cage
they're caged
they are concentration camps this is a
term
that has been used at the very least i
think uh
the the most the earliest use was in the
late 1800s
we used them uh people referred to the
internment camps that we had for
japanese
concentration camps this is a term
that exists in fact when jews were sent
to
concentration camps
in germany they were ultimately turned
into
extermination camps some of them some of
them were actually just uh
maintained to feed extermination camps
and so alexandra ocasio-cortez
used that term concentration camps other
people want to say
private you know non-voluntary hostels
youth hostels i guess is what you could
call them
if you were wanting to avoid what they
are but
here is uh bill hemmer
in the middle of the afternoon uh
interviewing
um he was the former
acting right which clip number is this
um he is the uh
national border patrol council art del
uh cueto the vp of the national border
council and uh here he is
both these guys getting really indignant
about uh the use of concentration camp
didn't at one point
trump use the term holocaust no i don't
know
uh but here it is cortez had to say
she's the democratic congresswoman from
new york she described these
concentration camps down there on the
border
let me just play a little bit of what
she found on i think it was on instagram
just watch here
the united states is running
concentration camps on our southern
border
and that is exactly
what they are the fact that
concentration camps are now
in institutionalized practice in
the home of the free
is extraordinarily disturbing i i tell
you
she's not afraid of throwing out these
phrases i don't know if she's been to
the border yet
i don't believe i i've seen a report to
suggest that
hashi i haven't seen her down here in
arizona i can tell you that
and when any individual makes that
reference
uh it just it loses all the interest in
me it's disgusting to compare
uh concentration camps to what the men
and women are doing here protecting our
country
i mean in my eyes honestly you lose
credibility
i've had it you know up to here with all
these individuals constantly
trying to compare concentration camps to
what we're doing i was just at one of
the detention facilities
the kids were outside their cell because
we have so many of them they were out on
the floor playing puzzles
they were watching movies i just want to
point out
what he just said to describe how these
were not concentration camps
the kids were outside their cell playing
board games
because there was too many of them
packed into
like in this let's say almost heavily
concentrated
camp for them to fit in there
good here with all these individuals
constantly
trying to compare concentration cramps
to what we're doing
i was just at one of the detention
facilities the kids were outside their
cell
because we have so many of them they
were out on the floor playing puzzles
they were watching movies uh eating
cookies
and what have you and she needs to come
down here you know what i'll offer
to show her myself it was the
extermination of six
million people she used the phrase who
are concerned enough with humanity to
say that never again means something
has she ever been to yad vashem in
jerusalem or auschwitz birkenau in
southern poland
or dachau in germany never again is the
phrase that jews all over the world
use to make sure that the extermination
between 1939 and 1945
never happens again and she's using
concentration camps to describe what's
happening on the southern border
how in the world is that acceptable does
she not owe
every jew on this planet an apology
i think it's disgusting to compare what
the men and women do out in in the water
right now to that
and it is definitely a slap in the face
to a lot of these individuals that have
family members that actually went
through concentration camps
i've said it many times some of these
people need to crack open a history book
before they make some comments
she's not afraid to do it all right
first off
let's just put up uh the video of
alexandria ocasio-cortez going to the
border
uh it's on that uh tweet this is 2018.
there she is she's at the border she's
at the camps
so she's seen the camps she can't get in
because of the fence
that's there concentrating all of these
kids in there
but here's the point never again is
not to make sure
that we don't have the extermination
that we had in 1939 to 1945 because you
can't go back in time
there's never going to be another
extermination from 1939 to 1945
because we don't all fly in time
machines
the whole point of never again the whole
point
why there are holocaust education
groups why the museums themselves
aren't just there to tell the story of
what happened
the whole point of it and i know this
because it was a big part
of my
jewish education which took place
30 years after this less
is so that it doesn't happen in the
future
not just to jews the whole never again
was not just about
we're never gonna let this happen to
jews again it can happen to other people
but at what point in the process do you
start speaking up
do you have to wait until the first
person is starved to death in a camp
do you have to wait to the first person
who is
denied medical treatment dies in the
camp
do you have to wait until there are
actual
ovens
because you can't bury enough of the
people
and because we've hit where people have
died because they haven't gotten medical
attention
that's happened do you have to wait
until uh children are separated from
their parents
well that's happened or can you say
never again when people are put in
cages kids are put in cages
but allowed to get outside the cages not
of course outside the walls
of the facility but just the cages that
they sleep in
because there's so many of them they're
allowed to have cookies outside the
cages is that an appropriate time to say
hey never again
i don't think there's a single person
who is in any way involved in any of
these
holocaust education programs
or memorials who would say yeah the time
where you speak up
is only after the first thousand are
are put into the ovens or the first
thousand are put into a gas
chamber
like at what point do you say hey wait a
second i'm gonna operationalize
never again i'm gonna stop this now
so that it doesn't ever happen again
never again is not about stopping 1939
because
we can't stop 1939. it happened
preventing it from happening in the
future says hey you don't start
putting people in these internment camps
you don't start
prosecuting people who provide water
that could save the life of a
seven-year-old girl
who dies in the desert
you don't start separating
four-month-old babies from their parents
and losing them in the system in some
way
that's when never again means something
because if you wait
until it happens again then it doesn't
mean anything
oh i mean never never again after this
time
the whole point the whole point of never
again
is to speak out now when you start to
see this happening
when you start to see people caged
for no reason when you start to see them
behind barbed wires
for no reason that's exactly the point
that is specifically exactly exactly the
point
and anybody who uses that to stop people
from doing that
they're the the sanda commandos
i mean honestly
i mean underneath bill hammer
