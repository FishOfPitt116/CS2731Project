Billy I have a very important question
okay none of the Lion King commercials
have had Yonsei in them I'm concerned
she's not actually in the movie she's
definitely in the movie because I've
seen a rough cut and I've heard her sing
can you feel the love tonight
well with Donald Glover and I'm telling
you good wow that's really exciting and
that was never my favorite song if I'm
being totally honest right cuz they
don't sing it in the ratings right
exactly right
I like to know that John sang it I love
it on John um I don't want I don't want
to give too much away about that they're
very they do not want us talking about
it but I will just say honestly it it
made me cry but I was not expecting that
