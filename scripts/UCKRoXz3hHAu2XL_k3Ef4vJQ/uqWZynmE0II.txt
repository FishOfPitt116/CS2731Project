are you happy that lizzo has given the
flute something of a renaissance like
well people are really revved up before
the flute I know I was actually at
Austin and she had a show I think like
oh maybe an hour after me and I was like
semi contemplating just go in the
audience and just like starting a flute
battery wow that's actually what we need
you need it Liz oh I assume you're
listening to this you guys need to get
us like a flute duet album a flute
battle that is very between drama line
but about yeah I would love more flute
street battles I don't know yeah I mean
they could totally be a thing you know
