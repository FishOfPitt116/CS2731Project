i'm not sure if you're
aware of uh the walk away movement i'm
sure
it's been a lot of time and um
i am i'm sure that you have heard of the
saying what comes around goes around
and uh we mocked
brandon's ron strachanin
braden stryden about his walk away
movement
i went on to his uh youtube show
and uh apathetically steamrolled i
apathetically steamrolled him
and um you can be
smug and condescending only for so long
apparently
at least 52 years and
but then uh one day the the bell
tolls and it tolls for you
um this was intense i have become
recently aware of this
video and movement that has started
amongst
listeners of this program and um
i by recent i mean like last night
it was sent to me and uh this is
some upsetting stuff but let's play it
once upon a time i was a majority
reporter
i was a majority reporter i used to be a
majority reporter
let's be honest i was actually
just watching a libertarian debate
playlist right before i made this video
but that's kind of beside the point
the point is i became a member of the
majority report
so-called majority reporter
because i felt like i'd found a tribe
whose values aligned with my own
i detest callers who use bluetooth i
detest those who ask
is this me is this me is this me
sam is that you is this me
yes commerce it's always you i need to
test callers to go off about
nothing in particular for 15 minutes and
then save the real reason i called in
today was
i detest richard from ohio but he's
really funny by accident sometimes so i
wish he would call in more
where's he been actually shout out to
germa by the way
these are the reasons i became a
majority reporter and these are the same
reasons why now
i've got to jump for years now i have
listened even though some of the callers
are clearly
insane illogical hateful misguided
ill-informed an american hypocritical
ageist racist menacing callous ignorant
narrow-minded and at times
blatantly under the influence of black
market prescription painkillers
for years now i've sat on hold while sam
became more and more
patient with his bad collars
leaving the rest of us to languish
behind
silence i've been on hold a lot the same
self-proclaimed victims of bad callers
now turning on the good collar community
who've attached themselves to the
majority report to advance their agenda
namely the chris lopaco dissident
president ronald reagan
i have listened as majority report has
become hypnotized by judy gold yelling
 into her cell phone for an hour
before matthew film guy comes on and
gives you his shitty netflix
recommendations for an hour
and that's before some shitty caller
from scotland calls in
on fire rtc you can't hear anything he's
saying but he's trying to give you his
shitty netflix recommendations sorry
callers can't get to alia today
anyone who does not comply with their
prejudicial recommendations and follow
their orders is a racist
a bigot a nazi a white supremacist
homophobic
islamophobic xenophobic misogynistic and
really needs to see
sorry to bother you
really you should check it out sometimes
it's pretty good your call-in system
is shame of meritocracy blatantly biased
favor if anyone calls for a 210 area
code they barely get to me
they probably won't get to all of you
sorry callers i know some of you have
been on hold since that whole weird mic
thing the majority reporter now believes
that there's no need to
jump when someone calls in to discuss
aoc's 2032 presidential run
the next local dsa meeting or if
someone's just breathing too heavily
into the microphone
as if they were calling from a track
meet
[Music]
the majority report has now decided that
their point of view is the only correct
point of view
but they're really eager to hear you out
if you can get through and suppressing
lopaco raygun and dissident peasant is
fair to callers one as good as us
sorry callers we're running out of time
oh wait it's blake from arkansas he
thinks we should euthanize your
grandmother because her pills are too
expensive
mr has adopted a deleterious belief
system happily and without skepticism
separating people into groups based on
their area codes
and organizing them into camps of bad
callers
and good callers with hot takes who
you'll never get to hear from
they do this so they can bombard us with
ads for casper mattresses and harry's
razors
just copy.co-op it's coop okay
[Music]
i'm gonna substantiate it for the rest
of your show
they will tell you that you are only
safe under their supervision
they will promise to liberate you from
joe rogan and then
nothing sorry callers i have a dentist
appointment at three
once upon a time i was a majority
reporter
but mr has changed i will no longer be
part of a call-in show that contradicts
my values
of equal opportunity brevity tasteful
patreon plugs
impatience for and dancing on
george h.w
bush's grave so i gotta jump so i've got
a job
so for these reasons and many others
that are definitely not ridiculous and
very well-founded and reasonable logic
i encourage all the other callers to do
the same
jump going once going twice
gotta jump besides i got better things
to do with my time
i got a kid and
wait a minute actually
is this david pakman hi david this is uh
barbara's bush
[Applause]
shout out to chris lopaco and ronald
reagan and dissident peasant

just went up

that out at
chris at the chris lopaco's youtube
