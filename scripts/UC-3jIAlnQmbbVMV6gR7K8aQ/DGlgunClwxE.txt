[Music]
uh what happened to the joe rogan clip
you were going to play monday but put
off till tuesday did i miss it from
yesterday's show or did you forget to
play it says
moses uh in fact we have that clip it's
a little bit long but we have uh we have
time to play this
we won't play the whole thing but um
here is joe wrote i think it is uh this
is uh joe rogan explaining why gavin
mcginnis
is having to leave and lamenting on it
and this is what the you know
i mean uh i this is what
is problematic and it's not that what
rogan says
in and of itself is problematic the
problem is like this video
how many millions like it's like a
million views right i mean every video
he does gets a half a million views
and they are all what is what what is
this on this one how many
uh they're all they are all
young um
they're you know i don't know if they're
all young people but they're all like
huddersfield or uh baraboo young boys
yeah i mean and so when rogan who
you know is a uh
uh you know the the the source of like
news and
understanding and analysis for so many
people
um it's really dangerous to sort of say
like oh
um this whole thing was a
misunderstanding
but let's listen to what he says about
gavin mcginnis
having to having to step down or not
step down and gavin mcguinness's step
away
and we should also just add that gavin
mcguinness says there was no leaders
he was never the leader of the proud
boys he was just the founder
so he wasn't really stepping down he was
just disassociating himself
the proud boys then came out and said we
have a replacement
for gavin mcguinness it's our lawyer
who's a nut job in and of himself
also a clear uh racist
uh but why would you replace somebody
who was never your leader in the first
place can't really replace a founder
right that's weird but uh continue and
uh
you know look it's one of those
things you want to have a group
you can't control everyone in the group
so anybody in the group that does
something horrible i just sent you
something
pull this up this is gavin's response to
all this because so many people got mad
at me that i had gavin on the first
place
first of all i had gavin on because he
used to be one of the founders of vice
also because i had gavin on before that
and he was fun to hang out with then
when i had him on did he become weird
when i had him on the last time
one of the things that he was talking
about was the proud boys i didn't even
know what the that was
i think maybe i had heard of it but i
thought it was a joke
turned out it used to be a joke it
started off as a joke on compound media
and anthony will get into it better he
knows the history of it but they were
making fun of something
and they decided to make a fake mock
group called the proud boys
now the problem with this is when you
have a group that's supposed to be
fighting antifa and i actually tried to
express this to him when he was on the
show
because he was talking about kicking
people's ass we're going to punch him in
the face i'm telling him to punch people
in the face i'm like okay
that's not how reality works like i
don't know if you ever been punched in
the face
or if you've been around people that
like to punch people in the face but you
don't just punch someone in the face
what happens is you punch them in the
face they come back with a bat somebody
gets a knife people get guns
it always escalates it's going to keep
going you don't just get away with
punching people in the face
you know and yeah it's not good that
these antifa people bring bike locks and
smack people in the heads with them and
that's kind of the point in that in the
first place those people don't
understand
what happens when you start the chain of
violence
when you start that domino chain they
don't understand what happens for one
second see here's part of the problem
okay is there is a fundamental mis
understanding as to what
antifa is he is conflating
some groups of people who are um
who either protest uh or
you know may um you know use black block
uh tactics with antifa
gavin mcguinness at one point in his uh
his swan song
uh video said we never the proud boys
never go to antifa rallies
and harass them that's because the
antifa doesn't have
rallies they are a reaction
they are definitively as a
definitionally they cannot exist
as uh and they don't i don't there is no
group antifa there are people who decide
to go out and fight against
and there is it may have started as a
joke
but for whatever reason i have a couple
ideas
uh gavin started carrying it into an
organization that he could monetize
um all right continue so so this this
notion
that somehow gavin was responding to
the people who were responding to gavin
is not correct
not to mention it is literally an
initiation right
of the proud boys to beat up a leftist
or a liberal
continue i think that they're living in
some book that they love
about some revolutionary liberal
character that
you know reaches out and and and smashes
all these oppressors of social justice
that's not reality
in reality you just hit a guy with a
lock who's talking to you you assaulted
him with a deadly weapon and the next
thing you know they're going to kill you
or they're going to beat you they're
going to punch you so when a guy like
gavin
says something like you should punch
them in the face
i understand why he said that because
they were inciting violence these
these antifa people would hit people
with things they're wearing masks
they some of them some of them were
doing it non-violently
some of them just wanted what they
thought was the right things to happen
but like
all groups you get a big group
you can't control everybody in the group
and that happened with the crowd no it's
not what happened with proud boys
because you can go online and you can
see gavin
purposely inciting vi calling for
violence
this is not on his show on his show
in other shows on on rogan's show
yes and you can't be responsible for
every member of your group
but if you say go commit violence
and you have initiation rights that are
violent then
chances are you're gonna get some
violence but continue
two i think i think he decided to have
this thing that was gonna
you know mockingly oppose antifa
then it became real and then it became
violence
and just this is this is just one of the
problems that people have when there's a
 group of people
opposed to another group of people and
you know
him quitting the proud boys is
definitely smart but i don't think it's
going to help
because now people are there's they're
saying he's a white supremacist and
yeah what the perception that people
have of you is almost
important almost as important as what
you actually do
it's probably even more important almost
yeah because not for you
and not for me not for people that are
gonna actually read into it but for
people on the outside
the perception of who you are is is just
too many things to learn
okay he's a racist oh that racist
that's all people here
that's all they say and then they keep
moving meanwhile you got a guy who's
gavin who
uh first of all he's not even american
he's canadian second of all he's married
to a native american woman
he is not a racist he says he's a
provocateur
100 unquestionably he says ridiculous
 because he thinks it's funny but
he's boxed himself into a very
now i mean look i can only tell you that
i know that nearly all of gavin's
friends from a couple years ago are no
longer friends with him
i mean it may be every single one and
it's not because
they've uh they have a arms length
perspective on what he's doing it's
because they see
up front what they're doing all right
and um it is
he's attractive you know when you when
you sit there and you say you know
people just look at the surface and they
don't look what goes beyond it and he's
got a native american wife
as if that all of a sudden is he can't
be a racist
he can't be doing anything that's racist
or there's members of the group who are
black
or there's members of the group who are
latino they can't be doing
definitionally they can't be racist no
that's not
true i mean that's not
true you can promote anti-semitism
and have a grandchild who is a jew
you can you can be racist
and own slaves you know i just thought i
just thought you can
have sex with one of your uh
black slaves and still be racist i just
thought it would be bad
i just thought of bad about a
jew grant kid
bro whatever toy i mean honestly
like
this it is more nuanced than that
and really at the end of the day it
doesn't matter what's in your heart
the perception of what you put out is a
function of what you put out as a public
figure
this is the thing is like they want to
judge gavin based upon their personal
relationships with him
and the bottom line is it's irrelevant
99 percent of what gavin
is and the only reason why anybody's
talking about him
and the only reason why he has to
disassociate himself from that group is
because of what he's done
publicly because of the perceptions he's
created and that have
caused other people to act upon that's
the only thing that's relevant here
this is not joe rogan at a bar talking
about one of their friends
this is joe rogan broadcasting to
literally
a million plus people that's too many
i mean whatever whatever it's just that
you gotta be
you gotta take some responsibility for
the
forever that's my common quote i say
it's you forever we're done
that's my common quote i say when david
cross stops returning my
text
[Laughter]
we really need to make some inroads into
the like stoner
college bro dorm room community
 you forever counter this what i say
nonsense
um then i gotta smoke more we'd watch
more mma
yeah like joe rogan is the smartest one
of those guys right now
but if you became one of those guys huh
that's gonna take a lot i think it's
gonna take i'm gonna have to wait have
you ever done dmt
i just like thought about like
it's like social security like they want
to cut it
all right but it's there all right get
time for one more call
solve it calm from 734 area code who's
this where you calling from
