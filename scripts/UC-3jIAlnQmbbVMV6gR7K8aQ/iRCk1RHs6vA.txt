um
all right so let's just start uh here
this
uh i mean any one of the top four
stories i have here
we could spend an entire show on
but we don't have the ability to do that
yesterday the trump administration
announced
that they had struck the deal of a
lifetime
uh with uh turkey this is after
releasing the letter
that uh looked like it was written by an
eight-year-old
um and supposedly showing how tough
donald trump was um
here he is making the announcement about
the supposed ceasefire within moments
after this
uh turkey made it clear this is not a
ceasefire
it's just a pause and it's basically
what what this amounts to
is um
uh basically saying like look you got
five days to go
uh we're going to you either ethnically
cleanse this area
the easy way or we're going to do it the
hard way and that's basically what
turkey is saying and donald trump is
announcing this as if it is some type of
huge feat of diplomacy uh
he waved essentially turkey in turkey is
a
nato affiliate i mean a
signed member of nato and uh
the idea that the united states wouldn't
have the ability
to say to uh to turkey no you're not
doing this
and it didn't have the leverage is of
course absurd but here's donald trump
trying to spin this in some way and
nobody seems to be buying it i mean i
imagine the people who don't care about
it at all buy it
uh some of his supporters but nobody
seems to be buying this
but this is an incredible outcome this
outcome is something they've been trying
to get for 10 years everybody
and they couldn't get it other
administrations and they never would
have
been able to get it unless you went
somewhat unconventional i guess i'm an
unconventional person
uh i took a lot of heat from a lot of
people even some of the people in my own
party
but they were there in the end they were
there they're all there look
this is about the nation this isn't
about republicans or democrats
this is about our nation so we have a
five-day ceasefire
during that five days the kurds and
other people that can be taken great
care of they're going to be moving
around moving out of a
safe zone which is something that turkey
has always wanted
the isis they call them daish but we
call them
isis the isis fighters that we have
captured
they'll be under very very strict
control of various different
groups but we will be watching we will
be in charge
uh he also went on and we part of the
clip also where he basically says
um the turkey the the turks need to go
in there and cleanse it i mean that is i
mean he literally says the word cleanse
um and i thought that was the clip that
we had there but um
i think it was just a different part of
of of what
trump is saying there but um it's
stunning
so he knows enough to use the word
cleanse
this is why when people say oh he's an
idiot he doesn't know he knows he's
there's he's like he has enough
information
there to use it the wrong way to be
dangerous with it
and i mean what somebody somebody could
have like
literally it could have been one of the
you know the the the senators who have a
problem with this come in and say
you realize you're basically the the
turks are going in there to ethnically
cleanse this area and he
probably had just stuck in his head
right and uh
then regurgitates it um but this is
i mean we're on the brink of a a massive
disaster now
the the the kurds have been sold out by
this country
uh i mean i don't know when the first
time was but i know it goes back at
least until like
the kissinger era where the kurds were
used uh
where the iranians used the kurds i
think on iraq and then when saddam
basically towed the line
uh we then sold out the kurds to
um to saddam and then george herbert
walker bush
said rise up in the north of iraq
and we'll be there for you and we
weren't um
it's it's a horror show i mean i don't
know what the
uh the the solution is in terms of
the you know uh but this is um
but we're on the brink i think of a
another humanitarian catastrophe and i
don't know
um i mean look the the syrian civil war
was one that um
we couldn't i think in my estimation do
anything
to improve the situation but um this is
one which i think we caused
do we have that clip of him saying
cleanse all right here it is
22 mile strip that for many many years
turkey in all fairness they've had a
legitimate problem with it they had
terrorists they had a lot of people in
there that they couldn't have
they've suffered a lot of loss of lives
also and they had to have it cleaned out
but once you start that it gets to be to
a point where a tremendous amount of bad
things can happen
so a process started and we started to
negotiate
and i think that obviously the sanctions
and tariffs were going to be very biting
i'm glad we don't have to do it we'll be
taking them off very quickly
as soon as this is finalized but this is
an incredible outcome this
so in other words you can go in there
give us five days get as many of those
people out then go ahead we're gonna
lift the sanctions
there's a lot of people who are
are i mean there's two different
theories here right one is that there's
some type of payoff situation which
wouldn't be that
terribly strange uh knowing donald
trump's modus operandi
the other is he just got rolled by
erdogan
and was literally just too intimidated
to do anything
do you think that or or i don't know
which one i believe but but it had to
have been one of those two things
i mean either either there is
some type of leverage being exercised on
trump
right by you know someone's giving him
this idea to do it someone is definitely
doing it
is it erdogan or is it who who benefits
from global destabilization and nato
you know i think we right i mean you
know look the uh
i don't uh russia's not upset about this
let's put it that way
um obviously but um
it could just be that erdogan just sort
of muscled him in it could be that like
oh he has a hotel there but
the idea that there is some type of like
policy prescription here that he is
thought out
or that his people have thought out or
the idea that
he thinks his people who vote for him
are really that heavily invested in
those uh
you know several hundred uh u.s
military personnel who are going to
leave small syria i mean you never want
to minimize any sort of presence
military presence but it's a it's pretty
small and they were basically
on a peacekeeping position exactly i
mean so of all the things that
places you could pull our military out
of um i mean
it was it was a combat theater but they
but they were not they were not actively
engaged in combat
um i mean it's hard to come up with an
answer that
people would get it is fun to hear him
talk about it like he's a goddamn game
show host though
