one thing we gotta watch out though for
jamie is socialism
and uh fortunately they have given
ben shapiro a television program
on tv you have um
to tell us the socialism watch
this is the bench bureau election
special
socialism watch here is socialism on the
ballot
oh maybe there we go cuba's going out of
fashion turns out that when people are
floating 1950s chevys into the atlantic
ocean
that's kind of a bad sign these days
norway
is the marxist paradise there's just a
few problems with this perspective
first off norway isn't socialist it's a
capitalist country
burdened with massively expensive
socialist redistribution programs
they're burdened with it you know who
burdened them with it the country itself
burdened themselves with it in other
words it's not a burden it's something
they've chosen to adopt
i thought it was cuba well he was
talking cuba first
now of course what he wasn't saying
about cuba is that the reason why they
have a chevy in the water is because of
the uh blockade economic uh blockade
right that we've had white white guys
again right exactly the embargo in cuba
uh
we didn't we wouldn't allow them uh we
we wouldn't allow for anybody to sell
them uh vehicles
so we're gonna mock them for having old
vehicles
expensive socialist redistribution
programs norway ranks 23rd in the world
in business climate compared with the
united states
at 18. posit so whoa ben shapiro
stop the presses ben shapiro has just
made a very strong argument that you can
have extreme
wealth redistribution in this country
and we could
virtually maintain our uh world business
climate ranking
even from the heritage foundation i mean
because
surely the only thing that we don't have
that we have going for is not just that
we don't have massive
uh wealth redistribution there's got to
be other things
right it's america we're number one
maybe 18.
and so so great though it's like if we
did all of these incredible social
interventions would only knock us five
points down the list well no
i mean it probably wouldn't it would
probably just knock us to 19th and
what's he doing 18th and 19th but i
don't know that that's his point is it
norway ranks 23rd in the world in
business climate compared with the
united states
at 18th as for norway's social programs
its spending habits have been subsidized
by an enormous oil slush fund
and supremely high taxes so there we
should do it um
the only way to do this is to get
enormously high taxes that's fine
and he's saying that we should ex
appropriate the
the um all of the oil digging that's
going on in this country
now i don't know if i would go that far
i'd probably do the uh refineries
uh i would nationalize but
it is an interesting idea it works in
alaska um
that money at least in some part comes
from um
the oil that is um uh dug up there maybe
we should do a part of that
i also just like though just like it's
public so it's a slush fund like
is exxon a giant slush fund yeah because
it's purdue okay well the fair enough
it's all the economy is a slush fund i'm
into it
i tax it here is the reality norway's
successes
lower levels of income inequality high
levels of prosperity
those predate the rise of norway's
socialist infrastructure
they're actually a result of nordic
social capital
high levels of social trust and cultural
homogeneity
presumably president obama would tell
americans that scandinavia
is a sort of heaven posit so in other
words uh socialism hasn't made things
any worse yet
it clearly has made for a lot more
um um benefits to people
at a time where inequality is rising at
more capitalist
and more capitalist economies socialist
one is sticking to
the reason why it's because there's
something special
about the nords there's a saying
norway's little slice of heaven check
their amygdalas
total heaven on earth in scandinavia
he'd say
there's no poverty well as milton
friedman responded to a similar
statement in america among scandinavians
there's no poverty either social capital
matters
culture matters that social capital is
being actively undermined by norway's
generous welfare state which actually
pays people not to work as the economist
wrote in 2015 quote
norwegians have coined a verb to nav
meaning to get money from nav
the state's benefits agency that welfare
state policy
also endangers immigrant social and
economic mobility
as of 2017 the norwegian labor and
welfare administration
found that about half the total number
of people in norway
receiving social welfare payments were
immigrants that report also stated that
many of those immigrants
what is what is social welfare payments
in norway look like
right like they get healthcare
they're getting uh all sorts of
different subsidies in terms of work
like what does social welfare
look like i'm curious
but everything sounds fine so far
receiving social welfare payments were
immigrants that report also stated that
many of those immigrants
were living in poverty-like conditions
well that's probably why they were
eligible for the
welfare but what he fails to argue is
what's the problem the only problem
it seems to me is they need to make the
social welfare payments higher
the only thing it sounds like he's
trying to argue is that there's
something
fundamentally better about the nords
yeah i wonder what that is well in his
mind it seems like he's arguing that
it's their homogeneous so they can
afford
to spread their resources no it's the
classic
they're all white so they have high
social trust which is why they have a
great economy and they can have it
they the right wing says they have high
social capital which is why their
capitalism works
and then the yeah what's that and then
the neo liberals say
they're they have homogeneity which is
why they're able to have a social safety
net
and they're both just lanes for arguing
against why we
can't have universal health care and so
on here it sounds like he
is making an argument that you can uh
genetically
have a higher class than other people
right he's tying it to race and racial
homogeneity yeah i mean they shift to
culture now but we know
yeah but it's the same uh pretty amazing
that the top
three um largest uh
amounts of scandinavians in the country
are in
uh blue states hmm
also i know i mean from north dakota a
lot of those people were given land
by the united states government when
they came over here and told if they
farmed it for a period of years they
could just have that
hey hey hey hey hey right shut up and i
imagine
uh unlike the um
the black folk who were given land at
that time or bought land
um didn't have it taken away by people
in the midwest literally have it taken
away
