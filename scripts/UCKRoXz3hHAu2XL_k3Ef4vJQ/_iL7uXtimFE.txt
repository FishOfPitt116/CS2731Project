tight ship elijah you know look at that
look at that you get one
horrifying two-week bout with pneumonia
and everything goes off the road we're
alive
it's we're we're i know i don't give a
 oh cool
priyanka's mic is now working what was
that i said
pianka
i'll get it welcome to
pod live america america
i'm john lovitz i'm tommy vitor we've
got
the whole crew here priyanka on the
swish board the ones and twos elijah's
on the ones and twos
it's your first stream back elijah this
is exciting
welcome back elijah now you may remember
this the last time elijah was in the
studio he was drinking something called
emergency claiming that he was trying to
stave something off
he then was out of the office for three
weeks months the point is
placebos don't work nope all right stop
falling for it all right
for all we know he made elijah sicker
just we missed you
anyway welcome back elijah could have
been out four weeks
[Laughter]
uh should we take some questions tommy
yeah i'd love to let's start
okay this first one is from matt um he
is asking about california
how you guys feel about governor newsom
canceling the high-speed rail project
and what it says about long-term green
infrastructure projects in the u.s
honestly high-speed rail had it coming
you know cancel culture
get rid of it um i had a very long
diatribe about this
on a little show called love and relieve
it it is true that newsom was in a very
difficult position
the project had gotten incredibly
expensive it had been delayed a long
time it was becoming more and more
unfeasible um this was a jerry brown
ambitious priority it was actually
something also the voters of california
approved in a ballot measure in 2008
but what happened to california
high-speed rail is similar to what's
happened to
infrastructure projects across the
country they face
republicans who don't believe in
supporting any kind of
infrastructure anymore they face voters
who
are insufficiently enthused about
paying taxes for infrastructure projects
and then they face
a thorny problem that has infected
virtually every infrastructure project
in our country which is
we really struggle through a political
process
um through uh the ordinary course of
governing to build things in any kind of
a reasonable time frame
for any kind of reasonable cost the the
cost of building
infrastructure in the united states is
too expensive it is not
uh a matter of um
of uh in in europe they can do it for
much cheaper than we can and in europe
they have
a lot of protections i don't think
anybody here anybody listening to this
would think that in europe they're
they're uh
sacrificing the safety and and building
unsafe projects so
um we just have a giant problem that
newsom faced i think it's really wrong
though that newsom said basically we
need to get real and scale this back
rather than
saying this project has gotten too
expensive this project is a mess i'm
going to fix it and figure out a way to
build it
and build it uh in a reasonable time
frame instead of just saying i'm going
to build a high-speed rail line
from merced to bakersfield and like you
know
i'm glad that the people of merced will
be able to get to bakersfield
and vice versa but i think if you ask
the people of those two cities
if that's a logical conclusion to our
20-year high-speed rail project they
would disagree yeah it's very dumb that
we just can't jump on a train
from l.a to san francisco it makes no
sense
uh yeah we just we just chronically
under invest in infrastructure i mean
remember 12 years ago when a
gigantic bridge in minnesota just
collapsed it's not like that
led to some uh crisis
in congress where we started reinvesting
and rebuilding things like lots of these
bridges are still in the same
dilapidated conditions so we gotta
yeah get to work here trump said he was
gonna do infrastructure remember
infrastructure week it happened for like
400 weeks
i don't see anything being built it is
terrible you know
i know this from just from being from
new york as well you know
the new york water system is incredibly
decrepid and is
um basically everyone understands that
there could just be a crisis where
parts of new york city will not have
access to water if these tunnels don't
hold up
chris christie canceled something called
the ark tunnel which would have
connected manhattan to
to to uh new jersey which was again
cancelled due to
um total cynicism and the failure to
keep the project
uh to to fund the project um you know
p buddha judge talks about the fact that
there are massive under investments
in sewer systems and water systems
that's something we see play out in
flint but it's happening everywhere and
it's not sexy but
uh you know we all rely on uh we all we
all tommy look shitter's full we've
all seen christmas vacation the
is full america's shitter's full
and it's time to uh full of trumps what
else you got
we'll switch gears a little bit our next
one is um on foreign policy
karen is asking uh is right uh karen's
asking about the trump administration
they owed congress a while ago their
thoughts on jamal khashoggi
um and i don't think that report was
ever submitted i don't either
uh is this a violation of some law and
if so why isn't this being talked about
more
yeah it's a violation of the law the
magnitsky act says
that they had i think 120 days to submit
a report to congress about
whether they would sanction or not saudi
officials because they brutally murdered
a journalist
in the consulate in istanbul and they
just blew off the deadline
and marco rubio and a bunch of
republicans are pretending to care
the good news is that um
chris murphy senator from connecticut is
working on this behind the scenes or
actually we were tweeting about it so
stop behind scenes they're working on
some sort of response
ro khanna a congressman from california
has been very invested
in uh what to do about this so i think
what
is likely to happen is like i don't know
how they can punish the trump
administration i mean i guess you could
put a lawsuit forward i'm not sure what
would be the outcome there but you can
also
you can take a bunch of steps in
congress to punish the saudis
in ways that will make the saudis flip
out and then
they will then complain to the trump
people and they'll try to fix it so
there has to be more pressure put on the
saudis
based on brutally murdering journalists
their ongoing disgraceful war in yemen
uh and the fact that the trump
administration just doesn't care
and they're maybe going to sell them
nuclear reactors is uh
insane yeah speaking of that um andrew
was asking about that report that the
trump administration pushed a plan to
sell nuclear power plants to saudi
arabia
um in the months after the inauguration
what is the significance of this
and the implications for the
whistleblowers what do we know here
i mean i only all we know is what was in
that article i think it's politico
it's a good piece that you know they
were going through michael flynn the
disgraced former national security
adviser through donald trump to try to
grease this deal
uh that would get a whole bunch of other
big trump donors like tom barrack
paid off presumably through the process
hiring michael flynn michael flynn
should not be talking to people
no at the white house because they're
all still being investigated for the
same
set of crimes yeah so it's like oh our
lobbyists uh
uh if our lobbyist uh talks to the white
house uh they're
committing crimes yeah so i it's a it's
you know it's one of these so-called one
two three agreements which is supposed
to be
a way to help countries get uh peaceful
nuclear power without giving them the
means to create a weapon
i think that we should be you know a
little less trusting of this current
saudi regime
mohammed bin salman has proven himself
to be a uh
sociopath uh and uh maybe that's not a
good idea to give the guy a nuclear
reactor
just a thought from me and there we have
it so congress needs to look into this
uh even more thoroughly and and take
some sort of step that's public and
transparent
cool all right we're we're out we're
done with the
shitter's full of nuclear stuff also the
 is full of nuclear stuff
um all right 20 20. madison is asking
can you guys break down
exactly what california's move up to
super tuesday means
especially what it means with such a
large field of candidates
i think nobody truly knows except
that we of course know that competing in
california
is incredibly expensive uh and it will
reward
campaigns that have huge amounts of
money
um and it will reward candidates that
have uh um
and therefore it will reward a small
number of candidates
either people like bernie who have an
incredible ability to raise money
or it will go or it will reward whatever
number of candidates have shaken to the
top of the pack
as you head into that final week because
they will be getting the most coverage
it's about being exposed to people in
california
and um that means that it'll probably
play a role in reducing the size of the
field
yeah so they moved up from june i
believe to march 3rd which is super
tuesday
uh interestingly california has early
voting so you can start voting a month
before the election itself which means
people will be going to the polls in
california or at least filling out
ballots
right around when the iowa caucuses
begin so it it will be an interesting
dynamic to see
how candidates end up competing in
california when the early states haven't
gone yet i mean
we're already kind of seeing some cool
side effects of this which is
elizabeth warren didn't just come here
uh to la this week to raise money and
visit us here qriket media
not to not to flex on you not to brag
but she did uh in this very room she'll
pundit right there and leo right there
right there but she also did a town hall
with like 2
000 people in in northern in part of la
so it means they're actually like doing
town halls and talking to voters and
trying to persuade people early
um i think like 10 of the delegates
that will go to the dn the convention
are from california
um it's not a winner take all system it
will be
they will be rewarded proportionally to
whoever does well over a certain
threshold so it's not like
you're just gonna win by one point like
the electoral college and get all the
california delegates and you mop up and
win but it will be
you know it will propel somebody
probably yeah
cool let's talk about money in 2020 i
know
yesterday people were and today people
have been talking about
bernie's huge haul in terms of
fundraising what is the significance of
that
and what should we be thinking of this
early into the campaign
how much importance does that have it's
a big deal it's a big deal
it's a big deal because of what it
represents
in that i think a lot of pundits uh
have a question and i would include
myself as one of those pundits
which would which basically says you
know how how
how much longevity was there into that
base of enthusiastic support for bernie
and you know we talked about this with
dave weil we talked about this with dave
weigel yesterday
uh what share of that enthusiastic
support was born of
bernie's endemic appeal versus the fact
that people were looking for an
alternative to hillary clinton and i
think a huge hundred fundraising
hall like that uh tells you that that
bernie really does have a
strong um level of support from people
that have not left him and will not
leave him and then there's also just
what the money buys you
which is the ability to organize the
ability to advertise the ability to
build a tremendous campaign so
you know we talked about this on the pod
yesterday is
by you know by any metric polls
fundraising
of all the candidates that have
announced so far bernie sanders is the
front runner
there's just no i don't you know you can
look at polls and say well biden's doing
better sure
you can look at institutional support i
i just that number should be a reminder
that
because bernie is out you know he's an
independent he's been considered
someone who is to the left of of
democrats generally he's not thought of
in that way but if this were
an ordinary another primary you would
say well he first of all was next in
line
he is leading in the current polls of
people that are in the race and he's
been raising the most money why what
standard is he not
the front runner it is a ton of money
yeah and like
you know let's say take for example the
2008 2007 primary i mean
the first quarter you spend so much time
in big donors houses doing fundraisers
doing events
sitting in some shabby room just
hammering through calls and doing call
time to big donors to try to collect
2 700 2 700 at a time and checks from
individuals or
you get big fat cats to bundle money for
you and have events with all their
friends
bernie doesn't need to do that if he can
raise money like this consistently
uh during the primary he'll be able to
fund his whole campaign and that frees
up like
hundreds and hundreds of hours of time
to just go to the states and talk to
voters i mean it is really
a huge advantage it lets him get his
message out it allows them to invest
early and not
wait to say hire 10 more organizers in
iowa or new hampshire or whatever the
hell you want to do so like
it's a big it's a it's a big deal
there's a reason they put it out it's a
big deal it will scare off people
the other thing i'd say is you know
there's been this debate online about oh
well it's a shame that all the democrats
are going to spend all this money
in a primary while donald trump is
raising for his own re-election
uh and there's some truth to that
obviously uh um
money democrats spent uh debating each
other is not money that will go towards
general but there is real value and
something
i think we that happened in 2008 as well
that because the primary between hillary
clinton and barack obama went on so long
the two of them campaigned
across whole swaths of the country that
the republicans didn't and it meant that
basically voters everywhere were exposed
to a democratic debate about what
democrats care about for a very long
time
in a very um kind of systematic way and
i think we'll see the same thing happen
here
so i think all in all like it's it's
that enthusiasm is nothing but
a good sign something else that
i feel like people have been talking
about a lot you guys have been talking
about a lot
um are things like abolishing the
filibuster and we have a question from
twitter this person's asking how much
weight should we give to candidates
willingness to play procedural hardball
a la abolishing the filibuster packing
the courts given that
otherwise no ambitious agenda things
that they're talking about on their
campaign
so far has much of a chance of passing
john favreau is basically a single-issue
voter on whether or not you will
get rid of filibuster um in the
conversation i had yesterday with
elizabeth warren i asked her some
questions about
this so stay tuned for that i saw pete
boudejas yesterday
he was talking about packing the courts
getting rid of the filibuster
um i think it's an interesting data
point i don't think we should have some
um fondness for the the ways of old and
and and how the senate used to work
given the fact that mitch mcconnell
could not care less and is willing to
steal supreme court seats and is this
craven a
person as you're ever going to deal with
so like i for it matters to me
yeah i mean i think i think there's the
issue of getting rid of the legislative
field
legislative filibuster and the fact that
basically
anything that's part of your ambitious
agenda is not achievable unless you do
that just to face the fact that that's
the truth
but there's a larger question because i
think a lot of what's happening now is
there's a realization that
there that that the the democratic
mainstream has shifted and the
democratic candidates have all uh fully
embraced that so you will you see a lot
of agreements
around you know from kamala from
elizabeth warren from from gillibrand
um you know and you've seen some people
like amy klobuchar being willing to say
uh you know i'm not going to sign on to
that or i think we can do this book or
do this incrementally but
but i think for those that have embraced
say medicare for all or the green new
deal
it's a lot of in a lot of ways it's
trying to send a signal to say like i
really
am this person who will fight this hard
i know what you're looking for
you're testing me to make sure that i'm
someone who will once in
office pursue these bold and ambitious
ideas and i think the legislative
filibuster
your willingness to say we should
consider removing it your willingness to
say that we need to add
votes to supreme court or or add more
seats to the courts
uh is ba is trying to send a signal that
you will fight as hard
as you claim in the campaign and i and i
think that's really important because i
think that what it represents is the
fact that a lot of democratic voters
have felt disappointed by democratic
politics that the campaigns
uh went further than the than the than
the elected officials
and that is what i think we're going to
be debating and reckoning with
cool this one's a bit more macro
um this question is asking with what is
likely to amount to a nearly two-year
election process
how can we make sure to avoid election
fatigue
or people being overwhelmed and no
longer as motivated by the time
november 2020 rolls around you know
it's a good question though the
interesting thing is
i think in past primaries i feel like
people see them starting up and they
think oh my god we're already doing this
again and you're seeing the exact
opposite of the democratic side this
time people are pumped
to get out and see candidates in the
stump and like it's been exciting for me
like the fact that we now get to talk
about
debates over the you know how to do
healthcare or the green new deal or like
proactive policies and not just complain
about trump
i think is actually not fatiguing to
people it's exciting to people so i'm
less
worried about this i'd be worried about
political fatigue if the primary gets
really nasty again like it did in 2016.
that's where there's a lot of risk that
we need to
try to prevent yes i would add one thing
so 2018 was the highest turnout in a
midterm and maybe what a century
that's incredibly exciting so and i
think we will see a similar
outcome in 2020 not predicting but i
wouldn't be surprised if it's the
biggest turnout in the history of a
presidential election our lifetimes
because the stakes are so high the thing
that i think we not we don't talk about
enough and didn't get covered enough is
democrats turned out in massive numbers
but so did republicans
so did republicans they really turned
out the republican turnout the vote
machine
is incredibly advanced and they make up
for lack of enthusiasm
they make up for the problems inside of
the republican party with a very
advanced
machine for getting people to the polls
tracking voters knowing who's going to
vote
and using money really effectively to
get that done so to me
i'm not worried about a lack of
enthusiasm but i am worried with
competing about competing with that
system
gotcha okay this next one is about
teacher strikes
um joanna's asking there are strikes
popping up around the country a few
candidates are calling for universal
pre-k or free public colleges
but we haven't really heard much else
about helping to lift up our public
education system or doing very much in
that area that's new
when are our public schools going to get
some love and is the suppressing issue
that we should be talking about in
democratic primary
it is the primaries just started i think
we got to give them some time to roll
out
policy ideas i guarantee you everyone
will be talking about
yeah making public schools better i do i
think everyone will be talking about i
think everyone should talk about it i
also think it's worth for liberals and
democrats to remember
that the department of education is the
weakest cabinet department and the
federal government has the least to say
about public education versus other
parts of
our society and so i think the truth is
the most important education battles
that play out in the country play out at
the state level
and they play at the local level um that
said
i think the most important trend to be
fighting is the fact that what we've
seen in
can uh in the midwest i'm confusing
which state has
the most recent strikes but even what we
saw in la what we saw in
west virginia kentucky is and kansas is
a rejection of
austerity state politics and i think
we're seeing the same rejection
of austerity national politics so it's a
big trend that's playing out but i think
the truth is
i'd be interested to hear what our
candidates have to say about education
but it is much more important as a local
fight yeah if i were running a campaign
though i would send my candidate to one
of these strikes and walk in march in
solidarity
yeah that's a good idea cool show up wow
free advice
there you go tweet it all right this is
our last one before we get to the fun
stuff
um i think it's a pretty good question
mike is asking
about your thoughts on sandusky ohio
voting to replace columbus day's holiday
with an election day holiday for federal
employees
um can or should this get some traction
kamal harris said she wanted to change
columbus day
to indigenous people's day doesn't that
have the same sort of effect
just if you guys want to talk about
these seem like different things
but yeah this seems like i mean that
let's stick with the first half
i thought that's a great idea i don't
know how they could do it or how one
does
voted like locally as a city like the
employees there
yeah hey liberal mayors they're just
giving themselves do it they're moving a
day off right they're moving towards
yeah great
everyone do that hey columbus mayor
cleveland mayor um do that i think i
uh i'm for an election day holiday i do
think it's not
that important compared to some of the
other things we can do to get people to
vote
right if you i think having early voting
solves all the problems of election day
holiday because
if you give people two weeks to early
vote at some point they can find a
window in there whether it's a day off
or a few hours from work to cast a
ballot
um so i think that to me is the more
important solution
and uh but you know i'm all for it i'm
far anything that makes it easier for
people to vote
and you know that's it
true cool all right fun stuff
okay this um is one from twitter so we
don't have a little card yet
but she i think is she this person is
asking if you guys have any oscar
predictions
thoughts hot takes who do you want to
win
i don't even know who's nominated all
right i'll i'll die
thank you all right um i'm still working
my way through some of the contenders
uh some free association bohemian crap
city
how long have you been sitting on that
one
that the fact look they should not have
added
more movies to the best movie category
and i think a great example of that is
the fact that bohemian rhapsody
does not deserve a nomination for best
picture it is
a mess how many nominees are there
there's seven now for best picture eight
for best picture
um you know that that's my one
big thought any ones you loved that you
said
i love the favorite i i did love the
favorite i know john and emily i believe
went with you
no no not like the favorite emily did
not like the favorite
guy that's what i've heard and i i don't
want to speak further there's a rumor
okay
uh i did send a let's say hypothetically
we heard that emily
didn't like the film the favorite then
hypothetically what might have happened
is i sent a series of like truly
over-the-line attacks on emily like
like very borderline like i should stop
sending these messages they are
too mean about not liking the favorite
and so emily i am
sorry that you deserved it
i'm also glad that the oscars reversed
their decision to air they were going to
air the editing and the cinematography
awards during the commercials
and all these great directors um
including the director of roma
uh uh said well hold on a second editing
and cinematography are what make movies
movies
and it was really insulting uh and they
reversed it it's the second time they've
reversed something too because they were
they announced that they were going to
do that uh most popular movie award oh
yeah and it was like what
what that's what the money's for yeah
the you get an award for making a
popular movie
millions of dollars i saw roma i thought
it was really good
i liked me i liked roma
a lot i think that the actress that is
the lead in roma deserves the
the best actress prize but
i will say that i'm going to cut 20
minutes
at aroma just give me 20 minutes just
cut 20 20
soft minutes out of that movie now john
you've had some experience in the biz i
was shocked
when i read how much these these uh
films are paying for their oscar
campaigns like
15 20 30 million dollars so isn't roma's
like insane
yes i mean it's i guess the logic used
to be you invest that money and you get
prestige but you also get ticket sales
in the new year i don't now i don't know
now it's just about
competition i don't totally get it i
don't totally get it
i mean it's just like if you won an
award buy a golden globe
a star is torn
outside is gonna not speak to you so
it's you know that
 period when a movie is available
on demand but only to buy
and not surrender we've been in that
purgatory for a while i won't fall for
that let me rent the
i don't want to pay 20 bucks for i just
want to watch it take my six bucks so i
have a fundamental problem where if i
get behind on a movie and there are
certain movies that i have to save
because we're gonna some i'm gonna watch
it with someone
and then it just doesn't happen and i
get in trouble
so i uh uh uh i was supposed to save the
film prometheus to watch with a golf
buddy of mine
and he he was asking me what time we
should see it the next time we were
together and he looked over on my phone
and saw that i was in the middle of
making plans to see it that day
without him and ever since it's been a
very um
saving films has become a delicate uh
issue have you been watching true
detective i am a few episodes behind
but i i've watched like the first three
or four i've gotten very into it
look i'm into russian doll as everyone
knows i've also been catching up on a
little show called shit's creek
which i love i did one episode i haven't
done more love shit's creek
broad city this season is great too
travis is like what is
what is this live stream what is this
travis do you like film and tv
no one cares you were heckling the ads
yesterday and it hurt my feelings wow
that was the best answer of this whole
live stream
cool okay nick is asking i think to
tommy but i mean
love it if you spend time in iowa sure
chime in um what is your best memory
of your time spent there and what is
your worst my best memory yeah
uh the best memory
uh i mean obviously iowa caucus night
winning but the jefferson jackson dinner
was great
um you can't stand the heat tommy you
stay out of it get out of the kitchen
that was a
that was a brilliant hillary clinton
line and john lovett wrote
take that to the bank uh one of my worst
days would be
uh i remember learning when we didn't
get the the endorsement of the des
moines register
i remember when we got that i was at a
1980s themed
uh tony and tina's wedding situation
where you're at a
party but the actors are talking about
it and we got the des moines register
and i was like that's it
there's nothing to stop hillary clinton
now she's going to be president any
 states
nothing could stop this i was on a bus
somewhere with barack obama
and robert gibbs and i almost started
crying and he told me not to be upset
because we tried our best i said okay
boss
that was very sad but the most fun part
was just uh you know
playing big buck hunter my favorite 11
at night
memory of being in iowa is
mexican
[Music]
all right laura is asking are there any
plans for crooked to host a debate
we think it'd be cool we think it'd be
very cool we've been stewing on that
idea
gears returning machinations wheels are
spinning it's on the record we think
it's cool
all right tara's asking cool are panda
and leo related
pundit and leo are half siblings
so yeah luca is not related to that he's
not related it's a totally different
breed he's a labradoodle
um so cutie though she's a good girl
yeah they are they are related
um why doesn't pundit have an instagram
hmm um
that's just for me here's what i would
like i would like to someone explain to
me what i get
for that time like what like okay so
let's say
so i make it instagram for pundits let's
say i make an instagram for pundit and
let's say i spend
ballpark low estimate two hours a week
that's a hundred hours a year why would
you one
day two hours a week you just post the
photos you don't have to like anything
pundit's famous
pundit's famous without instagram she's
already famous
yeah but like think about how many good
pictures you have you take so many
pictures upon it i do
she yeah she was with the celebrity
yesterday yeah
um i'll think about it i mean my
instagram is basically a pundit family
i'll think about it
okay cool all right um this is our last
question
uh and it's for elijah so i'm just going
to turn that
to you mia wants to know or actually she
just
i don't know if she wants to know
anything she just says elijah please
talk about duke versus unc
oh let's talk about it oh you no wait
you also you taught
maybe utah someone taught you about zion
williamson i learned today
oh you just googled it i know a lot of
things now that's great
yeah elijah how are you feeling about it
i don't know how this person
or if this person knows i'm from north
carolina but i have a lot
to say about this i actually
i've never really felt like the fake
news outrage
that a lot of people in this country
feel until i've seen espn's coverage of
duke this year
it's disgusting just the zion worship
yes and zion
i would say did you see the time you
blocked the shot
and the guy was shooting at three and
then he blocked it and then everyone
lost their mind for like
six days in two years
are you guys talking about paul
bunion what are you people talking about
elijah question from me to you why do
people hate duke where'd that start
oh god like seriously because they had
like they're like a rich school they're
a small school and they had a bunch of
like white preppy players
who like did obnoxious things google wow
they always win also like coach k
probably pays the players and
you know it'll come out down the road
anyway to the block point i would say
that zion is definitely a great athlete
not a question if he's a good basketball
player that's a hot tape
when you go for blocks you're out of
position to rebound
and also he dunks all the time
definitely athletic but the league
is trending towards three-point shots so
not a very cerebral player just as steph
i think his whole freshman year at duke
is boring
boring boring alert giannis
he's a mvp candidate he came straight
from europe lebron didn't even go to
college
so the blueprint for success is out
there spot the lie
son is not doing it apparently obama's
going to the game
yeah yeah what's science first name well
zion is his first what's his last name
williamson that's a good name do you
think obama will adopt
roy williams auntie zion position kind
of problematic for him
speaking of people that block barack
obama let's go back to talk about mitch
mcconnell
you know stuff i know about
traffic systems that your thumbs up
looked weird
whoa you have one of those thumbs that
goes all that my mom's does that yeah
she can hold a plate on it
that's gross oh god okay off the rails
thanks for watching the stream everyone
thanks for streaming no heels
yeah end of livestream
you
