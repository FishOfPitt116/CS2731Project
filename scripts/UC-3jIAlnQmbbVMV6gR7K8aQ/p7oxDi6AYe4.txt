calling from an 808 area code who are
you where are you calling from
work hello
hello 808 are you there
uh hello can you hear me yep
i guess not okay you're on you're on
hello
oh oh uh hey guys uh this is
sebastian from hawaii um hey just going
in to make more on that mod
point earlier um so
uh basically when it comes to protected
people's ware
sorry what point um i think he's talking
about mao
oh mao okay yeah all right go ahead yeah
so
so when it comes to protracted people's
law it's actually applicable not just
outside of like agrarian societies and
such it's basically
establishing hegemony or
counter-hegemony against the society
that
that you're in so it's kind of like what
that previous caller said when they
mentioned the black panthers it's
building a base of support and also when
you mention that
it's kind of a vanguardist movement
that's actually the
the i guess you could say the evolution
of what malicious and versus marxist
leninism is where it is in a vanguard
movement but it's
um like it's called the mass line where
they
they send out you know well-educated
or very uh enthusiastic uh
revolutionaries amongst the people
to teach and also learn from and then
they build
the party line to fit the needs of the
people
so yeah i mean i know i'm aware i know
i'm aware of that but i still i mean
in practice that's still a little bit of
like a rhetorical game like there is a
vanguardist element to it now and i
think
by the way like i don't think some form
of vanguardism is ever completely
avoidable the other thing i have to say
about mao
and we're gonna have to also like get in
the stalin category here too like
the other awkward part about ignoring
mao's record is like
killing millions of people like
and occupying other countries landlord
sorry i mean i mean i guess with
landlords that's all right
right like you like do you think that he
no i
i no i think with the great yes the
i do there's no responsible scholarship
that suggests otherwise
like i've read people who you know have
like a
very committed reading of mao and i'm
not saying even that
it was like pernicious or intentional
but there's no
doubt that the great leap forward and
those policies killed millions of people
and there's also no doubt
that and one doesn't need to have an
idolized version of tibet
and think that tibet was some
enlightened meditation kingdom to think
this of course it wasn't
but they did invade and occupy
and actually viciously wipe out a lot of
people in tibet
so like the record is not
great and the cultural revolution not
great
i mean really interesting fascinating to
read about
huge human toll like a very
mental i mean not even to brush that
aside the thing is though is that a lot
of people
like they hear these words like you know
marxist learners maui's and they
they assume that the people who read
these tendencies
worship those peoples whose names are
attached to it no i don't worship i
don't
i don't i don't assume that yeah i mean
the thing is like
all all the people who've come before us
they're the shoulders that we're
standing on they're the teachers that we
can learn from
to see their mistakes but also the
successes that could build a better
communism for the 21st century
and i mean i think all of that
i'm sure that there is something that we
can learn from mao i'll admit i haven't
read
much mouth i'm not as educated on it as
you are
um and i also agree that we should not
be tethering ourselves
to the historical tendencies of the past
for the very reason that you just said
right like
none of them have they've all got
they've all got problems
and we do need to build a better version
of communism socialism whatever for the
future
and that's why i hesitate to even call
myself
well i call myself a lot of things as a
shorthand but like
yeah we almost need a new name for
whatever it is that we are because we're
not
the maoists
go yourselves i had a maui speech
in vermont uh but also and also
do you think ideas i'm not sincere i'm
just asking because the other thing like
i don't know if i don't know if
different if like three world theory and
third
worldism holds up particularly well like
i i don't know i just
i'm not yeah i don't think so well
that's not all maui though right
well that is now i can't say for all
malice
don't even bring that nonsense up yeah
let's stay away from that
yeah that's just silliness yeah yeah
yeah
look i i'm sorry but like i mean go
ahead
i didn't mean to throw all people who
identify as maoists under the bus in any
way shape or form there's certainly a
strain
of dum dum left people who certainly
identify that way but like
you know not all maoists we had on brett
from revolutionary left radio on the
anti-fatah not that long ago and he's
he's a mouse and he is amazing and i
love him we didn't really get into
maoism on that episode but maybe next
time because i i would like to learn
more honestly
smart guy yeah they've got a lot of good
uh content on on
all the tendencies on that show so i
definitely recommend it for everyone to
listen to
do you consider yourself a mouse
uh i don't really no i mean i guess i'd
say i'm just
pan left i mean i'm pretty much
i grew up as an anarcho-communist but
like i just
i guess i fell away from the anarchist
part but like i just
i see that there's a lot of value in all
traditions like i like the praxis
and like you know i'm gonna you know
go out on the streets as that like the
anarchists do but i like the more
kind of like concrete organizing that
like other
communist tendencies that i've seen have
done and i guess
i'm also just kind of like kind of
reliving what my family kind of ran away
from because they kind of
as they they say they escaped communist
poland but like i asked them their style
of destroying the mask like my family
and like
i feel like that that entire facade of
like the anti-communist that they
raised me on has kind of like crumbled
away and i just see like
they like yeah sucked
it was a poor country that was bombed
into oblivion but they had like
stuff like this like the societal safety
net that we
in 2018 america are like
our our generation like crying for and
that's what they had as a bare minimum
and like instead of
running away from our problems they like
they should have challenged
the system like you guys in your
constitution state that
we have basic human rights we need to
push you on that and that's that's kind
of like for me that's like kind of like
the same argument like i would have
voted for hillary if i lived in a
you know a swing state because i
understand that the necessity of playing
within the system that you have
right but the fact that like my parents
they had
a system that really they like addressed
all human needs as a bare minimum yes
there was deprivation
and then but then the things they also
have to affect them like
imperialism and sanctions and all that
other
but i think it's so i talked with doug
lane about this recently and i don't
remember whether it was on or off air
but we were saying how i mean like
obviously you need to study
nazism and fascism for a variety of
reasons
but but the kind of core difference like
you study like the soviet union to to
figure out
how could something that particularly
like even just the revolutionary moment
of 1917
was so positive and such an unbelievably
like just emancipatory moment for humans
how does that turn into something that's
so horrible
i mean obviously in the height of you
know stalin just
wiping out endless number and right
and down to like a bureaucratic
dictatorship how does something that's
so great
and still does carry and we could say
this with mao
right even in china there's no doubt
that there
was enormous advances in women's rights
as an example right
but how do these things that uh
figuring out why things that are good
but turn
bad is more complicated and more
important
than figuring out things that were
always you know a poison pill from the
beginning
like nazism was this grotesque thing
because it was
but not i mean but people trying to
reclaim their lives from
feudalists and oligarchs and and and
govern themselves and their livelihoods
is
like that's in that's the one of the
most noble human impulses
imaginable so how does that change and
we and we don't know
i mean well i mean first i think the
thing that comes up with a lot of these
discussions
that i hear is that ignore like 1917
like immediately after russia was
invaded by
14 other countries and the white army
which was
literally like if if the white army
would have won the word that we used for
fascism would have been in russia
definitely like those are the kinds of
people they were up against yes and the
fact that the the bolsheviks
like they had like like that the
mensheviks the left mensheviks and like
another group
those people basically at the time of
revolution were basically trying to
undermine it all
and around that time that's when london
was like okay there's enough there's no
more party opposition because
we are literally fighting a multi-front
war against
like all these imperialist powers you
gotta get done
and the thing is like you know he he
brought about like a lot of
those positive reforms there's a lot of
negative but like the thing is all
that
is in all things in history it's
why we call ourselves materialists is
that all ideas and all
um situations are born out of the
context that there they come from
obviously
so so in conclusion shut up
mom i'm just kidding yeah kind of yeah
thanks for the call man i think i think
jamie's got a tee off on i love you back
i'm gonna let you go but i know you had
go ahead
oh no i just thought that was a very
thoughtful summation
of things that i also believe so
keep up the good work everyone sebastian
did a good
