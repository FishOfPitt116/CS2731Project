before we get to
greg sargent uh
this was odd donald trump decided to
have a
cabinet meeting we do have moments of
of of obviously the grand fealty that we
usually expect to see in a cabinet
meeting
not unlike what we do around this office
when we have an office meeting
i like to just assemble everybody here
and have them tell me
um how wonderful i am and how much of an
honor it is for all of them
to to be on the program uh but
before we get to that clip let's play
this clip where uh the president as far
as i can tell
is um talking about a dream that he had
it's different country than it was when
i became president
iran when i became president i had a
meeting at the pentagon
with lots of generals they were like
from a movie better looking than tom
cruise and stronger
and i had more generals that i've ever
seen and we were at the bottom of this
incredible room
i said this is the greatest room i've
ever seen
i i saw more computer boards than i
think that they make today
and every part of the middle east and
other places
that was under attack was under attack
because of iran and i said to myself
wow i mean you look at yemen you look at
syria you look at every place saudi
arabia was under siege
they were all i mean they wanted yemen
because of the long border with saudi
arabia that's why they're there
frankly what but every place was under
siege
and i actually asked a question how do
you stop these people they're all over
the place
they had plenty of money president obama
had just given him 150 billion dollars
who who was he even talking about it was
like honestly it was like i had this
dream i woke up i was in the room and
there was computers there was more
computers than it ever been built i'm
going to use that long border thing i
just learned
there's so many computers and then i
remembered exactly what i memorized for
the quiz about yemen
and i said it and all the generals liked
me and they said i was
great strong so strong and they were
strong and they're jawline
perfect not like tom cruise i feel like
anthony adameric
should sue trump for doing this now
like i feel like he does that like
trump's not even doing it like trump did
it he's doing it like uh adam right it's
like if
dennis miller literally started saying
yeah exactly
um i was becoming myself on a satiric tv
show
comedy central do we have the clip of
him also uh talking about uh why russia
invaded afghanistan i mean the the
it is doing lots of studying
i'm sure he writes steve calls uh ghost
wars during the shutdown
well first off the the story that he
tells about russia like
where could he have gotten this from i
mean
that's a good question this is rachel no
no no i mean honestly
like there's where did he get that it is
it is it's beyond reader's digest
and like he has access to all of
these advisors right it's bolton right
do you think about iran
no well iran is bolton afghanistan the
russia stuff probably does come from a
conversation with putin
probably right like literally
the reason why the soviet union went
into
afghanistan was because they had a
client government
in afghanistan that was essentially
being assaulted by all fronts because
they were so oppressive
and the the russians wanted to maintain
their client government and
but but listen to to donald trump try
and explain
the russian or i should say the soviet
afghanistan
conflict
we're going to do something that's right
we are talking to
the taliban we're talking to a lot of
different people
but here's the thing because you
mentioned india
india is there russia is there
russia used to be the soviet union
afghanistan made it russia
because they went bankrupt fighting in
afghanistan
russia so you take a look
at other countries pakistan is there
they should be fighting but russia
should be fighting the reason russia was
in
in afghanistan was because terrorists
were going into russia they were right
to be there
the problem is it was a tough fight and
literally they went bankrupt they went
into
being called russia again as opposed to
the soviet union
a lot of these places you're reading
about now are no longer
part of russia because of afghanistan
i i mean so that's
oh that's really inaccurate i mean
that's that's
like no but that's but that's the kind
of inaccuracy that it's hilarious to
hear him say and he probably did hear
from putin but it's
also like the broader fear-mongering
and a just complete lack of historical
information
could lead a lot of people i bet to
accept that interpretation
oh definitely and and they'd russians
specifically with their own sort of
imperial projection
you got to connect that understanding to
justifying what they do in chechnya
they run their own right islamophobic
foreign policy
and then to take the part about how like
it turned him into russia
you know like i could understand if he
was trying to explain this to a
five-year-old
but he's sitting in a room full of
people
who theoretically at least have a
fairly sophisticated understanding of
world politics i can't believe i'm doing
this but do you think he was
and again purely recycled from putin was
he trying to say
and this a factor in the soviet union
collapsing was how much they were bled
out by fighting that war
so is he so is he is he trying to say
that in a dumb way
oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah i think that
is i think that is i mean i don't think
it certainly wasn't the only reason why
um uh but it was a big factor it was a
big factor
no doubt but i'm saying like
he's so dumb that he doesn't have the
ability to express that like the
the soviet union broke up and and but
they called it russia
but it turned him into russia they had a
big meeting
and that guy like this is how you would
chorus justin
this is how he was explaining it to a
five-year-old
he loved him but you're in a room of
exclusively adults
sophisticated adults and you figure out
that he's not explaining it to a
five-year-old he's a five-year-old
i'm sorry tangent and petty tangent has
uh jonathan chait written a piece about
this yet right
because i would very much like to see
what kind of fever dream that's it's
like renaming
a building like they had to rename it
you had to rename the building right
said you know the name of that that's
how he yes
all right we gotta take a break when we
come back
