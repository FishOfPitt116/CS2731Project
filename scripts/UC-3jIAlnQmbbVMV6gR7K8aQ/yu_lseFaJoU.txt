ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show
thank you for joining us today uh
brendan at the helm
all right all right all right here we go
here we go
here we go uh very exciting
um we'll get to this question too
of um of uh
of castro
um a posting uh joaquin castro posting
the name of some uh contributors
trump contributors um in
the i think it was in el paso's um
uh district and um
the stories uh you know i encourage you
to um
maybe we'll see if we can put a link to
um to this
thread that is on and you can find these
stories in other places as well
but there's a uh reporter
named adrian castillo
and um he's written for nbc news
buzzfeed new republic intercept
um and he has a thread
it's very extended which starts out by
talking about
how folks don't understand
white folks don't understand
the implications of this in the way that
the latino community understands it
or they don't or just simply
saying that it's very very difficult to
understand the fear
that is running through um
the latino community right now
regardless of what's that when you
realize that the people who believe in
this ideology are like pillars of the
community you live in
that's terrifying right well it's also i
mean just
i mean i can tell you this that like you
know when there's a um a shooting let's
say at a pittsburgh
synagogue and i don't go to
synagogue uh very often but if it's near
the high holidays it occurs to me like
i'm a little bit nervous
about just going to temple you know
particularly with my kids
and the idea that you know and often
they bring extra security
but as i'm walking around
there's few places where
and apparently these uh white
supremacists they really like to target
the cultural
jews right sort of like what ben shapiro
was explaining that dynamic uh for us
but nevertheless
but when i go to the supermarket or when
i go
wherever it is i go to shop or to eat or
or hang out
i'm not gathering at a place that is
known for the gathering of a bunch of
cultural jews
and however
no because i'm white
but there are areas where obviously
there are it's
where there's higher density of latinos
and it's not
just that temple you know it's
this guy knows he can go to the mall or
there are cities
that have higher percentages that i mean
it's
um and so people are afraid they're
literally afraid to leave their homes
and
and then you see the the guy post this
just a couple of uh posts but then he
starts getting tons
of dms
from from different people thank you for
posting this thread on fear and latino
communities i'm white my wife is latino
we have
two kids under the age of three we live
in austis we're afraid to take them to
public places because of this kind of
stuff
her parents are immigrants and legal
citizens and we fear every time they
travel someone will accuse them of being
illegal and report them
and that their citizenship won't matter
because they're brown with thick accents
and speak better spanish than english we
already have stories of multiple kids
who have been taken into custody for
weeks at a time we only hear about it
once weeks at a time
never mind they were taken for an hour
or a day
or a night you can bet
if there are stories of nine-year-old
kids 16 year old kids being taken into
custody by ice
for weeks at a time
that we're going to hear stories of that
that there are stories of
adults and other kids who are there for
a night for an hour
they're stopped whatever it is um
and on top of that
when the standard becomes you can go
shoot up people at a mall
this story adrian uh my husband uh
writing to him my husband is u.s born
physician and of mexican descent
we're at a home depot in a white
community a white woman picked a verbal
fight with him as he stood in
the lightbulb aisle telling him to go
back to mexico when he told her
he was a physician in u.s born she
laughed hysterically and accused him of
fake news
i mean
if the worst thing you can do
is suddenly shoot 20 people
and dead and 30
others wounded if that's the worst then
you know
approaching some guy in uh the home
depot aisle because he looks
um brown and uh laughing at him that he
shouldn't be in this country
that's virtually nothing right in terms
of what the standards are
so i mean this is what this community is
facing
it's very you know i can sit here
in brooklyn and be horrified
at the the gun violence but
worried sort of generically when my
daughter goes
to school my son goes to camp or
whatever it is
but you have a a a
community a huge number of people in
this country
who are being terrorized
and when they look to the president
when they look to the head of the u.s
government right like
to the extent that we have a head of our
society
it's the president
and this is what you get
from the u.s president play this is
number one right like
think about this
you you have a community has been
targeted
and they just want a sense that
at least society is on our side
play this and we'll be meeting with
first responders law enforcement some of
the victims and
paying my respects and regards i'll be
going with the first lady
and it's a terrific
opportunity really to congratulate some
of the
the police and law enforcement the job
they've done was incredible
yeah i mean you now to be fair he did
say
he did mention some of the victims
but the idea i mean this guy
you know best case scenario can say
horribly incompetent
right just does not care about human
suffering he has shown this before i
mean i i'm surprised he's not going to
bring down a bunch of uh
paper towels to throw out to people he
might
make them feel better about themselves
school supplies
right catch it catch it bulletproof vest
but people should be aware
and you know i mean if you're if you're
stephen miller and uh you're in the
trump administration
and you're looking back on your three
years and you think about how you
terrorize the muslim population in this
country you think about how you've
terrorized the immigrant population just
broadly speaking you
you think about how the latino
population
is has been terrorized right from being
called uh
rapists uh gang members to uh
terrorists um to you know invading the
country to infesting the country
um you're gonna be in that white house
you could be thinking like
we're doing a bang-up job we're doing
exactly what we set out to do
we also have that other component where
we deconstruct the administrative state
that's
um that's happening but in terms of
striking terror
in this country
amongst brown people
we've done it we've also unshackled the
um
all the police departments around the
country giving them the the green light
don't worry department of justice will
not be
interfering with any of your stuff
i mean that's what the agenda of this
administration has been and it's
been successful it's been highly
successful
and we're only three quarters the way
through it folks
not even we're three quarters the way
through it in january of of
of 2020.
if only we were three-quarters of the
way through uh the foundational white
supremacy that exists in this country
well we may be we may be three-quarters
away through that but it's still um
it's still talking about like another 75
years of
uh of we still get a while ahead of us i
don't know i mean we're definitely
have we progressed yes to a certain
extent um
still hovering in the mid 40s though to
elect someone like this
and um
i don't know that we're ever going to
get to a place where we we
eradicate this type of stuff but we can
make it
marginalized
and look down upon enough
to give people
who are subjects
of this kind of terror some peace
and some sense of security and some
sense of belonging
and some ability to live their daily
lives without fear
without wondering like you know why why
is that guy staring at me
um there is a
you know i mean
none of what i'm saying is is in any way
sort of uh profound in any way but
there is look there's obviously like the
the the scars
of the the foundational racism of this
country and then the ongoing right like
through you know just institut not even
institutional
governmental through
the mid 20th century
um you know that leaves uh scars that
will be with us
and by us i mean with like the
african-american population
uh for a long long time
stuff doesn't flush out of the system uh
that's just human beings don't work that
way
you know you know you can't can't have a
situation where everybody's like okay
everybody born uh starting in 2020
we're going to take you away from your
parents for 10 or 15
years get through your developmental
ages so that we can sort of like try and
release
some of all the uh the scars
that get passed down from generation to
generation and the hatreds they get
passed down from generation generations
um it takes a long time for that stuff
to filter
filter through the
society
and um donald trump
frankly in this era
like obviously none of this is new but
there was an
activation and it didn't just come from
trump it came from
obama his existence the fact that a
black guy got elected
and the ability of people like uh who
surround donald trump and the fox news
and mitch mcconnell and others to
exploit that
to take this um
i don't want to say dormant but
certainly submerged
racism which is not
i'm not diminishing obviously how bad it
was
but i'm just saying like there's
momentum to this now
like the momentum is going the wrong way
and
that's going to take a long time to
reverse
just the momentum never mind the actual
uh problems that we have as as a country
in terms of race in these issues
so um
obviously we'll be talking about this
more

talking to margaret o'mara
about the code silicon valley
and the remaking of america
back sam cedar on the majority report on
the phone it's a pleasure to welcome to
the program margaret o'mara she's an
assistant associate
professor of history at the university
of washington and author
of the code silicon valley in the
remaking of
america margaret welcome to the program
it's great to be here sam thanks for
having me
so um let's start with um
of why why california
i mean because one of the stories or you
know in fact let's before we even get
there
um let's just talk very broadly for a
moment about
the myths that you perceive that are out
there
about the whole genesis of
silicon valley and those creators
yeah well we you know close our eyes and
think about silicon valley the
sort of faces that immediately pop in
your brain perhaps are
steve jobs um mark zuckerberg uh these
sort of iconic
singular entrepreneurs founders leaders
um
you know they're who are celebrated not
only beyond silicon valley but
by silicon valley itself and um and also
a kind of free market techno libertarian
story
of this is what happens when you let the
creative
entrepreneurial folks do their thing and
when government gets out of the way
and there's actually that's only part of
the story and so what i wanted wanted to
show in this book was not only
showing how how the story we know about
silicon valley also
fits into this much broader tapestry and
the government is part of that
all right well let's i mean let's start
with just why why did it land
in um in silicon valley in california
as opposed to say uh route 128
in massachusetts yeah well
for the first you know first few decades
of silicon valley's existence as a
tech hub um boston was very much in the
picture and actually
boston and the valley had a kind of a
symbiotic relationship that was
beneficial for both
both places grew like drew into
electronic hubs
because of um the cold war
and the with something that the federal
government does in the
the beginning of the 1950s which had
never done before which was
start to make major peace time if you
can call the cold war peace time major
peacetime investments in scientific
research and development
not only in defense spending
and spending on very high tech equipment
for the military and for the space
program
but also investing in higher education
in colleges and universities both on the
research side and the teaching side and
and some of the biggest beneficiaries of
that bounty
were in boston harvard and mit and in
the bay area
stanford and berkeley so what i mean
what happens with all those things that
get developed there
like i mean you know i mean the money's
going into
educating to re funding research
theoretically they find
stuff right um a lot of stuff
we have invested i'm i'm an investor i
paid taxes i paid taxes in massachusetts
uh at one point um
where's my bounty
well the bounty is i mean this is an
only in america story and i think it is
one that is
is it really instructive particularly we
think about the rest of the world that
has
tried to build silicon some things and
continues to do so
and hasn't quite replicated the the
what has played out on the west coast of
the united states
and so it's a matter of a lot of of
government funding
and and you know keep in mind this was
not altruistic this wasn't necessarily
entirely in the pursuit of you know
higher truth and a commitment to higher
education also had to do with
competing with the soviets not only in
terms of building more sophisticated
weapons but also
producing more scientists there was a
lot of um
chatter in the 50s and 60s um about you
know
not only you know beating the soviets to
space to
the moon um but also in you know how
many scientists
the the soviet union was producing and
the u.s needed to keep up
and this was you know this was a matter
of of national pride and also part of
the larger project of showing why
you know a capitalist democracy was a
better system than
than socialism uh so so there was a lot
of
kind of this fire hose of money flows
in the direction of science and research
but it being america and keep in mind
the 50s this is the
mccarthy era this is not a time when
large government schemes are in fashion
you know part of the whole cold war
project is you know
you don't want to be seen as socialistic
in any way and dwight eisenhower
um you know was no fan of big government
he was someone who
who was uh suspicious of large
centralized schemes
and and uh and railed against them um
yet
uh under his watch there was this this
great expansion of what he
later terms the military-industrial
complex but how it flows
is not just building big federal
research
laboratories which certainly existed but
in addition flowing that money
indirectly through universities through
private industry and this is the key
thing i mean this is really how the
flywheel
starts going and if you look at the
valley in particular
you see not only one university stanford
that kind of remakes its entire
curriculum to
be a receiving uh entity for this new
federal money you know building up
electronics building up physics
building up you know the small
electronics and communications
technologies that
that the valley starts specializing in
from the very beginning
but also flowing to big defense
contractors like lockheed which locates
its space and missiles division
in the valley in the mid 50s and also
these smaller companies these companies
that become the
grandparents of every venture-backed
startup
that follows companies like fairchild
semiconductor which is
not a defense contractor per se but it's
founded in the late 50s
right as sputnik is rocketing into space
and it
it has a big book of business from the
apollo program in nasa among other
places
so that's kind of this this relationship
between public and private is something
that we
miss in the story and it's really
important and it's fascinating i mean i
i
i almost i mean i i laughed when you
said like we
you know we wanted to beat uh we wanted
to prove that uh
free market capitalism could beat uh
socialism so the government poured
all this money into the market and
i wonder if that is actually what free
market capitalism is like i mean i don't
happen to believe that free market
capitalism actually exists
um yeah it's just a question of who's
going to get the largesse
from the the government slash
the people and what are they going to
get back for it and
yeah i mean i'm happy that we were
i mean i feel a certain amount of pride
i guess
that we led this technological
revolution
but it's not like these other countries
don't necessarily get
access to that technology now yeah they
certainly do
and look we're you know we're at a
moment of um you know people aren't
feeling
particularly great about the tech
industry so it's so much so that i find
myself
trying to you know remind some critics
of well you know we are carrying around
super computers in our pockets like
there have been some upsides to this
whole operation but this
but you're right there's always been a
government presence and it's both in the
kind of
keynesian you know poor money into the
system
of the you know pre-1970s period and and
very much you know around defense and
and aerospace and then after the 70s the
government is still there
in its you know in you know how is the
other way how
what's the other way the american
government state
uh aids uh enterprise and individuals
it's through the tax system
so you have you know stat tax breaks for
um you know capital gains taxes that
benefit venture capitalists and other
investors you have
um you know tax breaks for that are some
some of which are targeted
towards the electronics industry or for
scientific based industry
um that again are very generative but
also our you know shows that
there is there's effectively a federal
you know
the government's giving a boost um to to
these industries but doing it in a way
that
allows for enough creativity iteration
and you know a private enterprise to
flourish
um and and people to try and fail
uh that and also does it in such an
indirect way that
oftentimes the people who are the
beneficiaries of it feel like they did
it on
all on their own right that seems to me
to be highly problematic
because when we get when when california
let's say or when when the federal
government gives
a capital gains break uh to these
companies or any type of tax breaks
what they're really doing is saying
we're giving you free services
right it's because it's not just we're
we're giving you a tax break it's like
we're providing you all the things that
you need
in terms of an environment in which to
create this stuff
we're just not going to charge you for
it and so it's we're giving you services
in kind
really as an investment rather than a
tax break we're just giving you free
services
and the other thing that strikes me too
about why california succeeded
and it goes to show that that i think
from a from a statutory standpoint
um this provision where
it um where it did not where
where it did not allow for non-compete
clauses and contract law will you
explain that because that i think is
is is huge and it's
still very much like those type of
questions uh you know
are are still very much um uh highly
relevant across
american society it seems to me and it's
a very good
indication when you talk about uh the
government stepping in to the to the
so-called freedom of contract
this was really huge it seems to me in
terms of the development of silicon
valley we
will you walk us through that yeah so
non-compete clauses essentially
are you know things that are appended to
employment agreements saying
you cannot leave our employ and then go
to a direct competitor
you can't be you know in a particular
knowledge sector where
the people and the ideas are the raw
materials
it's really limiting that that free
movement of people and ideas across
companies california does not allow
those and this is an inch you know i'm
in seattle
washington state for example does you
know does allow non-compete
and and you can even see this kind of
reflected in the two ecosystems of these
two tech hubs
um which is you know seattle has been
long been it's
changing now but it was kind of it's
kind of a a town dominated by one
company at a time you know first boeing
the microsoft now amazon
um although that's changing quite a bit
but down in the valley you have this
this perpetual job hopping and you have
people moving from one
firm to another starting from the 1950s
on
that you know and with that they're
sharing ideas they're
creating this network which for which is
really critical to
you know going back to your why
california question or why the valley
you know one thing the valley has that
boston does not is
this it grows in isolation it's a very
sort of specialized economy
and very tight small and tightly
networked everyone knows each other
everyone
you know their kids play on little
league together they go and drink beer
after work together they work together
not just one company
but multiple companies and then they go
on to become a venture capitalist that
funds the next generation of companies
and on and on
and non-compete this legal environment
contractual environment is very
important
there are also so many other california
specific things that are feeding in
you know the the pat brown era
investment in
social infrastructure broadly defined
everything from public uh public schools
to higher education kind of the clark
kerr era higher education
expansion of public higher ed in
california during the
during the 50s and 60s the building of
roads building of public infrastructure
of all kinds
it it enables this this society of
these this path for tremendous upward
mobility for so many
people who happen to be there at the
time where you see these
you know someone like steve jobs who
comes from a family and his dad had a
high school education
and he's a product of california public
schools but heck there was a
there was a computer lab in his high
school in the late 60s
um and and this is you know he's able to
kind of get on this incredible escalator
because
in part because of this public
investment which of course
changes dramatically after the late
1970s well
tell us how well before we get to how
that public investment changes
um but you you write that
the uh homogeneity of the
of silicon valley was both its its
greatest strength
and its its greatest weakness um
explain that for us yeah well the
you know i i refer to the valley as this
entrepreneurial galapagos it it grows up
i mean
first of all it starts off very it's
very remote it's rural
you know it's far far away from wall
street in washington
the national papers don't report on
silicon valley unless they're putting it
in air quotes until
like the the early 1980s it's it's you
know it's a very
kind of off to the side of the main
action and that allows these very
distinctive species to
in isolation of sorts um not only tech
companies and
and engineering focused businesses but
law firms
and venture capital firms and marketing
firms that are all
and devoted to to to bringing up these
these companies and there's a there's a
very specific personal dimension to all
of it because
the model of venture-backed startups
is you find a a person who
with promise with a promising idea and
oftentimes they're
a young man in his early 20s who has no
business experience
um he comes with an engineering degree
he's never really run anything
and so you need this whole kind of
concert of services and firms that are
helping you
mentoring you in many different ways and
when you're
making a bet on an untested person
you're often going with
gut you're going with okay this person
graduated from stanford's
master's and whatever that's a
recognizable you know that produces good
people
um this person is um you know
knows used to work at this other company
or knows someone i know
and so there's a lot of hiring and
investing
based on existing social networks and
ties
so when you're starting from a place to
a
world that is entirely male and almost
entirely white in the 1960s the world of
engineering
a world in which you know women were not
a department chair could sort of
decide they weren't going to allow women
in their classes there were very very
few technical women
in um in the that world then and those
that were kind of
learned on the job but despite obstacles
and so you have this very homogenous
pool that you're picking from and when
it becomes a multi-generational
phenomenon i mean the
the real talent of the magic of silicon
valley is time
that you have multiple generations of
com people making
making it big in a company they founded
or being part of a very successful
enterprise
then they become the investors of the
next generation they're picking the
winners they're looking at the younger
you know 20 somethings who are coming up
with big ideas and saying
all right i'm going to invest in this
person and oftentimes it's investing in
the man
investing in the person as much as the
idea and so
this is how you know when you're again
going with what you know
it's very hard to let some new voices
and new people in the room
right and you're just not i mean you're
not you know it's not dealing
there you just there's no physical
proximity
like you're just not no bumping into
these people on some level
you're not you're not well how much of
it i mean
how much of that because i guess that
you know the value
in understanding that dynamic right is
to also understand like
the implications of that dynamic down
the road like
there's no reason why in 2020 let's say
that a single a similar dynamic
couldn't exist where if that community
um had um you know
now presumably more women who are in
those fields
uh but also um
people of color who are in those fields
they're all living in that
that same era i mean it would be
interesting if we have the ability to
sort of like say like
what would the trajectory of
the of the t of tech as we know it today
have changed
if there was more diversity of
experience
and thought uh and perspective
in the beginning there right because we
have now
what has clearly become a severe
consolidation of this right like
the the the utopia of democratization
while it's there on some level uh you
know
twitter i think democratizes the
political arguments to a certain extent
but we're really i mean we've created
these behemoths
and they are so powerful that we don't
we have society has not been able to
sort of
figure out what to do with them and much
of that it seems to me
has been driven by a sense of conquest
and of accumulation and in many respects
to the extent that there ever was this
sort of notion of like
we're gonna have a community with a
bunch of different things growing
um that ethos seems to have
gone away where uh it turns out like i'm
the
bigfoot and i'm going to eat all these
other small companies and bring them in
the fold as it were
and in some of them i'll i'll kill off
good ideas
that exist because i'm not prepared in
my entity to compete with them so i'm
just going to kill them
so i don't have to and i'll get back to
this in five years yeah
well you know it's interesting yeah i
mean counterfactuals are pretty
difficult to prove but um i you know
would if there have been different
people in the room at the beginning
would it have changed
i mean i don't know i i think that maybe
the the um
the types of technologies would have
might have been different the questions
obviously when you have different people
in the room you're asking different
questions or identifying different
problems to be solved
with the kind of um the drive to bigness
to scale the incredible competitiveness
of silicon valley which is again
part of its secret this incredibly sharp
elbowed
um you know move fast and break things
which is not you know was not a sort of
philosophy invented by facebook
it's a it's one that is very much baked
in to the culture it goes all the way
back to the chip making industry of the
1960s where you did have to
move really fast you had to have it was
a it was
an extremely um hard charging
environment of
unvarnished criticism it was kind of
this you know
frat house meets uh scientific lab
um meets military barracks and it would
could be a very inhospitable place
for people who didn't have an extremely
thick skin and for
people who were trying to you know
balance a
a life outside of work and also it kind
of became a very
um you know a very incredibly masculine
environment
and with the sort of the normative you
know that
the norm was to be a sort of tough guy
and
and that was celebrated um andy grove
the the legendary ceo of
intel you know one of his he wrote a
book called only the paranoid survive
which i think kind of
sums up both the the market imperative
um you know this is how the the the
industry had to
operate in order to scale and to do what
it did but also
shows how different different approaches
might have been foreclosed now
you know i think you know here's where i
see daylight um and i see some really
interesting things um and i
and again i don't think that if there'd
been women in the
in and people of color in the room at
the beginning you know if
i mean who knows i think there were some
some moments where
those possibilities were foreclosed you
look to the very early
personal computing movement in the early
1970s where
people are coming out of places like
berkeley and stanford
kind of baby boom era vietnam era
technologist saying hey
let's take computing power and let's
make it personal let's you know we can
use these
these machines as tools to solve all of
the
social problems we see before us and
there were a lot of women
in that conversation initially and they
had more idealistic and less
profit focused ideas about how to go
about it
and they kind of fell you know fell out
they they didn't become part of the
industry that emerged from it
and there was this techno-optimistic
presumption
that really you start you know you see
throughout the entire history of silicon
valley
which is that the tech is going to solve
things that society is messy
it's yes it's it's unequal yes there are
these problems
but if we have these machines and if we
connect them
and if we can all have free flowing
communication
you know get rid of the gatekeepers get
rid of the bureaucracies get rid of the
you know the military brass and the
politicians at the top
then we're going to fix all of it and of
course this was
in the light of you know the world of
2019 seems
absurdly idealistic but that is the that
has been this driving
if silicon valley has a political
philosophy that is
it and it is one shared by both men and
women by you know by
by technologists across the spectrum
it's just that the
the the more idealistic voices kind of
got got eclipsed by the ones who were
you know it's it's just been
it's been so easy to make so much money
and that's
that's a problem i mean it sort of feels
like that
and and granted right you had a bunch of
very
intelligent people who were who gathered
at the exact
uh you know at the moment when the
technology became
sort of realistic and and in the wake of
the massive investment that came with
world war ii it seems to me
um and the how how fast that pushed
technology forward to the point where
these
were uh were semiconductors and
computers became
sort of realized i think you know much
earlier than they probably would have if
we didn't have that
massive um um uh you know world war ii
industrialization
i guess um but it also occurs to me i
just can't get over the
you know the it's one thing to say i
want to get everybody out of the way
after they give me the cash um and
all the benefits of all the work they're
doing and we should also say there's a
story about
uh immigrants too oh it's a huge story i
mean i think the
the 1965 the heart seller act which is
the immigration reform act that lifts
the quotas
that have been placed in place since the
1920s that had so
so restricted immigration and restricted
it on a on a racial and ethnic basis and
geographic basis
that is you know i think it's perhaps
one of the most important economic
policy acts of
the last 60 years and of course it was
not designed to be such it was kind of
this crossing the tease and dotting the
eyes on civil rights it was making you
know making a wrong right
and what it does is it opens up it
precipitates these new waves of
immigration and you see this
particularly vividly
in silicon valley where you have a great
wave of immigrants many of them from
south and east asia
who moved to the valley in the 70s and
80s and after
that are not only the engineering
backbone of these companies but also
at a disproportionate rate found
companies
um and their children found companies
and so the children
the immigrants and refugees and their
children are really the kind of
lifeblood of i mean they are
americans don't have haven't cornered
the market on being you know good
technologists it's
that the united states allowed the free
movement of people and capital
and opened its doors to so many people
from around the world
and made it a place where if you're a
really smart technologist
and you know name your other country
your goal is to get to
the valley and um and the current
the current mood the current political
climate in the united states is not only
actively you know creating barriers to
that but also actively dissuading
um technologists from doing that and
also doing that at a time when other
places
have reached critical mass where you
could stay in your home country
and have as successful uh a career as
you might have had if you'd moved to the
united states a generation ago
and wasn't there also like a a a
significant number i don't know if they
were documented or undocumented
immigrants
who were actually manufacturing were the
workers in the uh
manufacturing the chips uh absolutely
yeah so so that you know look this the
santa clara valley before the silicon
valley was silicon valley it was the
just plain old santa clara valley it was
an agricultural valley
valley in california it has had you know
look it was part of mexico so there's
been a mexican-american population there
since before the anglo population but
there also has been you know significant
latino and
asian american population there since
the 19 did the early 20th century
working in agriculture working in the
canneries and then after
beyond that for successive waves of new
immigration that yes
in the you know in the 50s 60s 70s and
into the 80s
the valley was a manufacturing region it
was a place where the
dominant industry was semi-conductors
microchip makers
that was computer hardware that was
making stuff
and that manufacturing you know that
tech is still
a you know still has a giant blue
blue-collar workforce it's the submerged
iceberg
underneath the you know again what we
think of when we think of tech we think
of these white-collar engineers but
the go juice is not just assembly line
workers who now are in taiwan or
shenzhen or other places
um but also the you know mechanical
turks
started the gig workers the um that the
great
uh the amazon warehouse workers this
incredible this large blue-collar
workforce
that is made been essential to making a
place like silicon valley and a place
like seattle
run for so long yeah i mean um
it it it's it's sort of stunning in a
way because my understanding um
i think it was from uh um a a
a a book by i'm it's driving me crazy i
think it was louis hyman
uh yeah on tv
discussed the role of undocumented
workers
um in in building that um
that labor force that could produce that
stuff and then
the idea of something like palantir
right which is uh peter thiel's company
which is now basically um
it does a lot of other things stuff that
i don't like but
now they basically developed the
technology for ice to find
those very people who probably made
their technology possible
yeah yeah and palantir itself kind of
embodies the contradictions that are so
baked into silicon valley i mean peter
thiel
is outspoken libertarian you know when
you think of silicon valley
libertarianism you often think of peter
thiel it's one of its most outspoken
proponents an
outspoken supporter of donald trump kind
of the lone the lone trump supporter in
2016
um in the valley and uh or at least the
sort of the loudest one and uh and his
company palantir is
is you know built its book of business
and continues to have
you know a significant chunk of business
from the national security complex um
that
you know the talent here was launched
through cia contracts and
and it's just grown from there and so
there's this dissonance between
again the kind of free free market free
enterprise
ethos of um of the valley and this this
very deep intertwining with government
and particularly with the defense
complex which
by the way never went away i think one
of the things i i
really fully reckoned with when i was
writing this book because this is my
third book i've been looking at the
tech world for 20 years now and i had
you know i
have knew the and been writing about the
cold war history for a long time and
but what this really drove home to me
kind of my book goes all the way up to
2018 essentially when i turned in the
manuscript and
to send it to the printers um is is that
the
defense department never went away the
lockheed missiles in space remains the
biggest employer in the valley through
the 80s
in the in the 80s and 90s you know darpa
was extraordinarily important
um particularly in in giving
support to basic research in computer
science at stanford and elsewhere
these foundational technologies that on
which the big companies of today
have grown including google um it you
know came from this money not to say
that they've always been engaged in
defense work but it's
it's really hard to separate out and the
government's never gone away and that's
i think one of the reasons i i want
technologists to really understand this
history
is not to say oh you guys didn't you
know entrepreneurship doesn't matter it
does matter
i think that that we need to recognize
how you know there are
there is a reason that apple and
microsoft kind of broke away from the
pack they have these extraordinary
leaders that had a
particular skill set and talent that
that need to be
um recognized but there also is this
role of the state
and society that that any story of
american business enterprise whether it
be agriculture or steel
or high tech you can't take the state
out without and and of business history
it's all connected
yeah i suspect that um uh the more
knowledgeable of those
are uh are fully aware of like the
the the the origins of that neoliberal
thought as it came out of like mont
pellerin
that was yeah none of none of what
they're doing is inconsistent with that
vision
uh it was never about getting the the
government
out of uh the mar it was to have the
government
filter basically a certain amount of
control uh
to a certain set of players and uh
and keep it there and that that sort of
feels like what's happened to a certain
extent
but there is a lot of mass delusion and
i hope a lot of those people read your
book
um i hope so margaret o'mara the book is
the code
silicon valley and the remaking of
america thanks so much for your time
today i really appreciate it
it's been great talking to you sam
thanks so much bye-bye
there you go folks
the code we will put a link at majority
fm
uh and now we're going to take a break
head into the fun half of the program
just a reminder it's your support
that makes this program possible when
you become a member of the majority
report
you become the wind beneath our wings
you make uh these interviews that we do
every day
sometimes we do like a news round up
every day
i mean not every day we sometimes we
dedicate the whole
show to news roundup sometimes we
dedicate it to interviews
um our members make that possible
you can be one of those people who will
be the wind beneath our wings
i can't believe i surely have used that
before right
i just i don't not i got to have
i just i don't remember but it's got to
have happened um
and then when you become the wind
beneath our wings i'm going to really
use it all up now
you um you we give you extra content
every day
then some little bonus stuff that we're
developing as well
for our members um
so uh stay tuned for that but you also
help us launch the am quickie which we
are doing now every day
and we're endeavoring to get it out
earlier
and earlier we're working on that
and we're gonna put it on its own feed
come september
and you'll be able to listen to that and
get your little uh dose of news
that you need and um so uh become a

slash majority today is wednesday which
means that last night was tuesday
which means that tmbs happened um
michael has since disappeared apparently
which means michael's usually here to
talk about what was on tmbs
i think i think professor wolf came in
and did all that stuff
so check that out on his youtube program
um
jamie the auntifada yeah so
this week on the antifata i was away at
the dsa convention
but uh sean and andy recorded an episode
along with our friend jake flores
you may know as the dhs's number one
comedian to watch
um they talked about mk ultra juggalos
manson i don't know if they talked about
charles or maryland
potentially both um and the new
tarantino movie once upon a time in
hollywood check it out
also fans of my side project with leslie
lee iii from struggle session

actual
vampires uh that's coming out on friday
for our patrons so check it out literary
hangover
check it out available on itunes and
uh youtube uh michael i already promoted
for you you obviously were not listening
to the program and we're not aware that
uh
you were being i apologize no you don't
have to apologize
see you in the fun half
jamie and i may have a disagreement yeah
you can't just say whatever you want
about people just
cause you're rich i have an absolute
right to mock them on youtube
he's up there buggy whipping like he's
the boss i am not your employer you know
i'm tired of the negativity
i'm sorry i didn't mean to upset you
you're nervous
you're a little bit upset you're riled
up yeah maybe you should rethink your
defense of that you're idiots
we're just going to get rid of you
all right but dude dude dude dude dude
dude uh you want to smoke this joint
yes do you
feel like you are a dinosaur
that's a good exactly i'm happy now
the win win
it's a win-win win uh hell yeah now
listen to me two
three four five times eight four seven
nine oh six five oh one four five seven
two thirty eight fifty six twenty seven
one half five eights three point nine
billion wow he's the ultimate math nerd
don't you see
why don't you get a real job instead of
stealing vitriol and hatred your
left-wing limbo everybody's taking their
dumb juice today
come on sammy dance dance dance
grandpa i had my first post-coital scene
with
a woman i'm hoping to add more moves to
my repertoire all i have is the dip and
the swirl
fine we can double dip yes this is a
perfect
moment no wait what you make under a
million dollars a year you're scum
you're nothing excuse me
 you you liberal elite i
think you belong in jail
thank you for saying that sam you're a
horrible despicable person
all right gonna take a quick break i
want to take a moment to talk to some
of the libertarians out there take
whatever vehicle you want
to drive to the library what you're
talking about is jibber jab
classic i'm feeling more chill already
donald trump can kiss all of our asses
hey sam hey andy you guys ready to do
some evil
wow wow that's weird
no way unbelievable
this guy's got a really good hook
up
no worries let's i want to just flush
this out a little bit i mean
look it's a free speech issue if you
don't like me
hey hey hey hey shut up thank you for
calling into the majority report
them will be with you shortly i shall be
with you shortly in fact
let's do this quick you're calling from
a 478 area code who's this where are you
calling from
four seven eight good afternoon good
afternoon sam this is captain jordan
jeffy all right my speakerphone's on
thank you can you hear me
i can hear you what's happening jeff
from georgia
uh not much sam i appreciate you taking
my call i i actually wanted to feel a
little johnny and sonia john from san
antonio slot today a little bit because
i want to talk about uh
you know boring old electoral primary
stuff man because
someone occurred to me the other day
that what's what's really going on in
the democratic primary for some people
is
something called a keynesian beauty
contest do you know what that is sam
a keynesian beauty contest
yeah it was something that uh you know
not my favorite economist
obviously i'm more of a marx guy right
but uh john maynard keynes came up with
this idea about
how he thought the market worked in
terms of how they bought stock so he
imagined that you would have a beauty
contest in a newspaper
but instead of picking the person that
you thought was the prettiest or most
attractive
you instead picked the person that you
thought
everyone else was going to think was the
most attractive
but the problem is is that everyone else
is also playing that game and so they
are also
all trying to pick not who they think is
the most attractive
but who they think everyone else thinks
is the most attractive
and you can see that by drilling down
into this sort of like
you know endless hall of mirrors right
trying to figure out what's inside of
people's heads
you you can you can come up with some
really up like non-rational
decisions in the marketplace right i
think this also
applies to politics there are a ton of
people who have convinced themselves
that they know what the working-class
people of this country
want and what they won't vote for and
they tend to be
you know multi-millionaire pundits on
cable news and some of the bigger radio
and
podcast and online media platforms but
they don't know anything they are
guessing
just like everyone else is guessing like
i
i'm i it is bizarre to me
the most small c conservative choice to
win back the presidency for the
democrats is bernie sanders
that i don't i don't see how anyone else
can see it differently he is absolutely
the safest choice to get
the president's event anyway that's all
i've got for you guys we appreciate it i
i appreciate that
and um i will say this uh folks should
check out the distant peasant uh podcast
available on itunes uh or wherever your
podcast is served
but i but i would say this that
uh um there's the
i mean you're you're right i mean the
the
the the polling bears this out
that i guess for 50 of the voters
in the democratic primary is the polling
um electability is the first choice
is the is is their first sort of like
criteria
and um joe biden
by maybe twice the numbers uh you know
of of
bernie sanders and a little bit more
than elizabeth warren
people think is electable the
the the danger of this it seems to me is
i think sanders
obviously but warren
i think even harris i think even booker
to a certain extent have at least
a contingency of people who are like
i desperately want them to win
and i just don't you know i i don't
think that there's
anyone who feels that way about biden
i think there are people who are
casually like yeah i like biden better
but the problem is and i think we saw
this
with clinton's campaign i mean look
so much of what we focus on in the uh
2016 is like why she lost
and i've said a million times i think
there's a literally a dozen
but fours that had had they changed um
she would have won had she changed them
had had the outside forces changed
but then the question is you know why
was it so so
tight and we have a very polarized
country
al gore lost george w bush by 500 votes
in florida supposedly
but the differential between al gore
and george bush at that moment um
it's not hard to see how they could be
um there could be
you know equivocation amongst some
people but uh
to to a larger debate to a large extent
i would say that
there was there's a lot of people who
critiqued
the clinton ground game and
part of it was a strategic decision that
they made by modeling
you know who was going to come out to
vote and getting that wrong they got it
wrong i mean i remember
the call that we got from mike from pa
the day after the election
and he said you know we saw this in
pennsylvania we sent people out to get
out the vote and they were knocking on
the door
one quarter of the time and they were
finding that they were knocking on the
door of a trump voter
now the reason why that happened is
because hillary clinton
modeled used models tech to determine
who those people were rather than
sending canvassers out to go out and
find out what was happening on the
ground
and so they thought they had this
amazing ground game when in fact
it was this amazing tech game now the
story we've always heard is that
this was a conscious decision on their
part and it may have been a situation
where they pushed
you know volunteers away right but it
also could have very well been
a way of them not acknowledging or not
having to deal with the fact that there
just
wasn't the level of enthusiasm that
you need in a modern campaign
and i mean my biggest fear about joe
biden
though my biggest fear about joe biden
is i think there's not going to be the
enthusiasm
that's going to get people people will
vote for him but it's not going to be
the enthusiasm that drives people out to
get the marginal people
to come vote because what they want is a
narrow
coalition right like joe biden and
clinton
both in 2016 and in 2020 hypothetically
they they want a narrow coalition of
suburban
semi-professional professional class
people they
like that that is the coalition that
they want like i am convinced that they
are more concerned with winning a
certain way
than they are with winning because if
they win
with the votes of uh an energized
working class i think that that
terrifies i totally agree with you jeff
i i i was making this argument
that clinton and chuck schumer
were protecting paul ryan and
they that is why you have that quote
from i think it was
uh chuck schumer who said for every
uh two or three steelworkers we lose
we're gonna gain
four in the suburbs and you know you had
chuck schumer bragging in october of
2016.
i've got and people can look for this
quote i know it's out there i've got
schumer
i've got ryan i've got clinton and we're
gonna make a deal to get
they were gonna they were gonna bring in
all that offshore money
right that uh corporations have been
hiding there since george bush's last
moratorium
because they don't want to pay those
repatriate that money and pay taxes on
it
they were going to keep it offshore and
they were going to bring it back in and
i think the deal that schumer was
talking about is like
we're going to get back we're going to
give him a discount it's going to be 15
or 12 percent instead of the 20 or 30
that they
they should pay and then we're going to
use that money for infrastructure
and they wanted to protect paul ryan
through that election which is why they
never went after paul ryan in my
estimation
they were thinking they were going to do
well in the suburbs which is why they
never went after paul ryan
right because paul ryan's like okay
of course we're going to lose with
donald trump but they're protecting me
and schumer was bragging i got all three
of them and i'm gonna make this deal
which incidentally is a bull crap deal
um for a democratic president at that
point make them pay their taxes
how about you rescind this free gift
that um
that truman gave them so that we could
build uh markets all around the world
they're built
incidentally and now it's time to end
that uh large s that we're giving
corporations
but with all that said i agree i mean i
don't know
i don't know how
i don't know how if they look at it in
the way that
you and i would describe it but they get
to the same place
maybe through a different mechanism
right like they are the future of this
party
is here as opposed to there because
things have died out or whatnot i mean
in many respects it's no different than
the decisions that were made
in the 70s and the 80s and frankly into
the 90s of the party
that you could see that decision made
over and over again and we've talked
about that
um uh don't blame me they're democrat
the
the there's an author from uh from
massachusetts who had done
uh about uh a a look at massachusetts
and how that changed in massachusetts
particularly around 128 actually
um the the tech world um and so
uh yeah we did why when did we do that
into well you don't know you weren't
even here i don't think
uh but we did that in 2015 or something
i'll look for that but but but you're
right
appreciate the call jeff thanks dave you
guys have a great week
you too dissident has it folks man
i know you don't like electability
arguments but i feel like
if that's what so many people care about
and there's a good electability argument
to be made for bernie sanders
why not go to there well i mean i think
at this point the
you know the that ship has sailed the
the
i mean i agree with you i think you got
to make that argument now i mean i you
know at one point
that ship sailed and uh i didn't you
know
the the ship to make that argument
you're saying
the ship to avoid making that argument
sailed
right like you know um at the start of
the
the primary campaign i was concerned
that frankly um well a
i felt i still feel the vast majority of
the the candidates
that have a viable chance of winning the
nomination can win
i am most concerned about joe biden
and um because of
the reasons i've just mentioned i mean
and every day he goes out there and he
not only
you know there's there's two halves of
this right it's the candidate
it's ability to candidate well
and uh to campaign well and
there's the like you know what's gonna
happen on the ground
joe biden has neither he's neither i
i two things i mean one i will say i was
completely of the school that if the
numbers line up anybody from
you know the great choice to the worst
choice could beat trump
i'm increasingly uncertain of that just
because i'm watching them perform and to
me it's not
i'm seeing a lot of question marks and
not just biden but it strikes me that um
the best way the ship has sailed on the
electability argument and a way we could
maybe make it
uh more beneficial to our advantages is
using it as an example to debunk broader
myths about the electorate
like mike from pa does a really good job
on this in terms of
you know and i've talked about on this
show these like the voter surveys from
2016 that again i mean the really
simplified version is that
the middle of the country is socially
moderate
uh to maybe even center right and pretty
economically progressive
right and that shows us that our you
know
there's a couple of different jobs to do
but that's a part of the reason that
there can be such a default that sanders
is not
obviously quite electable particularly
in the rust belt is because of this
zombie idea that never goes away that
normal voters in the middle of the
country are like waiting for a joe
scarborough candidate
well and we could we really need i mean
it's
abundantly empirically inaccurate that
like you know it's like
some guy sitting at some place in
wisconsin is like i really wish someone
would just come along with like a
moderate tax credit scheme
i feel like in this day and age it would
be
to the benefit of the country if there
were people who were as engaged who were
like
i just don't agree with his policy
proposals
and his ideology i just i don't think
there's that many people i don't think
people think about it that way
no i don't but i do think that again you
can measure some of it
and i think also that policy especially
uncertain like part of the reason that
people trust bernie so much you can't
look
if bernie i agree that it's not all
ideological but if bernie was going
across the country and he was the same
guy
with the same shtick and the same
grandpa charisma but he was saying we
need to get serious about the deficit
and cutting spending he would be a two
percent in the polls
so you know so of course yeah so i mean
because he'd be also running against
well half a dozen other people who are
doing it and no and also to to be fair
the broader argument he wouldn't be
activating the
you know millions of people that have
gotten engaged yeah he's speaking to
their real interests we're gonna have to
redraw the map
i think trump's going to be a lot harder
to beat than a lot of people think that
he is
because none of the conditions that led
to trump have really changed if anything
they've intensified
all the people who are upset about trump
voted against him the first time around
and it didn't work and bernie's the only
one with
a chance of redrawing the map and the
way he's going to do that
is not by appealing to the small number
of white working-class swing voters who
have economic anxiety
right he's going to do it by appealing
to all of the people who don't normally
vote
and i've said it before and i'm gonna
say it again and that group of people is
disproportionately poor
it's disproportionately people of color
and
we i don't know if it's gonna work but
he's the only one that it might work for
i think there's a huge amount of swing
quote unquote in the rust belt which you
need to win
some of them flipped to trump some of
them didn't vote some of them are white
some of them are people of color
and that's the path it's all of the
above i suspect
that um donald trump
has proved himself to be um
much more aggressive on his uh racist
diatribe that i think we're going to see
i think we're going to see people who
may have
not seen sufficient difference between
clinton and trump
in 2016 um come out
and realize
like i i i don't i think there were
people who sat on the sidelines
last time for a myriad of different
reasons
but i think
uh trump has disproven at least a
a set of the a subset of those reasons
like
he is going to deport people he is going
to kick out a lot of immigrants legal
and otherwise
um and he's not going to do anything
about income inequality or reinduction
you're not going to do
any of those issues right and and i
think there's a certain amount of people
who
left the things blank because they're
like i don't like this candidate
she's gonna win but i can afford to not
vote for her
and i don't know what that percentage is
but it doesn't have to be very much
again so who knows
but uh i just worry that
i mean if joe biden had the same support
in the electorate as he does now
but was you know
more like present as a candidate i'm
trying to be
delicate here like i worry just like
we're a year away from that election no
i i totally agree and i actually again i
actually think
like setting the part where i do set
ideology aside and just look at
performance and style
i think frank like 2015 joe biden
would have a quite easy time beating
donald trump and including because he
would be able to lie
and evade and mix up the differences on
all sorts of trade issues just like
trump has and be playing with the
advantage that trump's already debunked
his own rhetoric
but watching biden now it's like oh
i mean somebody was joking that like i i
think
like is he saving is he saving is he
saving the reservoir for trump and i
mean forgive me is a little crass but it
was just such a funny lie this friend of
mine was like you know if they're both
like going senile to
use it you know blunt leader like trump
will just power through it
right like trump will just go see that
well because no problem
of negotiating wasn't like i made sense
to begin with non-uh look
non-adept trump is not terribly
different
than adept oh wow i'm stringing together
random words in an incoherent way what
an incredible innovation nobody's heard
from me before yeah it's like supporting
a band's early material versus their
later stuff it's a matter of preference
for their fans let's just find it hard
to believe that there's that many people
who weren't bothered by trump's racism
four years ago but are now
i think a lot of people probably didn't
pick up on it or not to the same
i think a lot of people didn't pick up
on it in the same degree i think a lot
of people thought that he wasn't gonna
win and that it wouldn't be a problem
um i think there's i mean i think um
i think it's very possible i mean i
i don't know like people didn't take it
seriously
sometimes when you see uh people put in
cages
and kids being kidnapped from their
parents that may motivate you more there
might be some people who are just as
delusional as elite media types i mean i
remember listening to
i'll say specifically in this case david
axelrod and alex wagner
a couple of weeks before trump got
inaugurated
seriously talking about the possibility
and say it was a certainty
but just the possibility that like well
you know
now he's president so he might really
grow up and get it hey
i think a lot of i had actually heard
they actually thought that was a
positive thing which is incredibly
delusional
i also wow there's also a set of people
who are like
okay trump's bad but it's not like the
republicans are going to let him have
his way
right mitch mcconnell and paul ryan will
really hold that in check there was a
lot of people
i remember that a lot of people who
thought that in fact
that was not just the sort of like
people who are in sort of the mushy
center
saying that uh i remember one
um a youtuber who was also making that
point that was gonna save us
the republicans are never gonna go along
with donald trump
and then they'll be a filibuster right
and then by the time you get to 2020
there's a revolution
do you remember what he said was the
revolution was gonna look like
that was the most okay i don't know
maybe liz was born
right exactly exactly that was when i
really got
livid because i was like i was already
singer like
my god in 2020 it has to be bernie
sanders what are you doing
that was that was like you're ruining it
from both sides
being consistent
but if we do i mean believe me my my big
fear too at that time was
that we would get i specifically said
like
after bush we got obama
and i don't know that we had better
options
in that election frankly but
we just you know people want to get it
people want to get it over with
they want to get them out i understand
the impetus they may be wrong in their
assessments
we may be wrong in our assessments as to
who's going to win
who can win easily or not but the
it's not surprising uh
at the end of the day that you have 50
percent of them were like i'm going to
choose electability
and then just everybody assumes that
they can determine what electability is
and maybe they can
i don't know another obama would be the
most depressing outcome
because four years later you're going to
get someone worse than trump
wow another white podcast hosts to be
the even more depressing outcome
wow you're in brooklyn and you're a
socialist get the out of here
oh sorry youtube rules uh on my bad
yeah thank you um okay so let's um
sorry let's get to uh this
uh senator pat toomey from um
well who do you get what do you get up
there let's
pennsylvania oh yeah let's now let's
first go to um
uh donald trump we'll do a couple more
donald trumps here uh
here's donald trump
really i mean
if you stop like if you if like i'm just
about to go into this i'm like of course
he's saying this and then i think
wait he's the president of the country
and 30 people almost
four 29 people have been shot dead by
machine gun
you know fire i know it's a machine gun
i just want to get all the ammo sexuals
to call in like i just want to correct
you
it really does a disservice to a
sensible gun reform legislation
to call it a machine gun even flippantly
well we can't even let's not call it
sensible gun reform that is whoa
don't say comments don't take comments
silencing
sexual voices
shot dead
uh almost twice that injured
the idea that the president is doing
anything other
than consoling victims
decrying the political terrorism
that impacted that caused at least the
el paso
shooting and speaking to
the latino community and assuring them
we are with you
we will protect you we will do our best
to to fix what is so wrong in this
country
now instead he's like you know
i get a healthy dose of what about ism
this is number two in our country for
all of us
so from your heart from your mind what
do you say to your critic
that believes it's your rhetoric that is
the question is what do you say to your
critics from your heart
that your your words and your rhetoric
have emboldened white nationalism
because
they're just asking this and of course
they're doing it because they're the
liberal media
they just recognized that
the amount of the the creed the screed
that this guy
wrote was basically just showing
together
stuff that donald trump says tucker
carlson says laura ingram says
and uh then going out there and his
response
is anger so my critics are
political people they're trying to make
points in many cases they're running for
president
and they're very low in the polls a
couple of them in particular very low in
the polls
if you look at dayton that was the
person that
supported i guess you would say uh
bernie sanders i understood
antifa i understood elizabeth warren i
understood
had nothing to do with president trump
so these are people that are looking for
political gain i don't think they're
getting it
and as much as possible i've tried to
stay out of that
yeah wow that's nuts she imagined
elizabeth warren i mean i really wish i
could do her impression because just
like trump does all of those like i mean
he said in 2016. i have the military i
have the cops i have the bikers these
are tough people and right now they're
being nice but they might not be not
like
do you imagine if elizabeth warren was
like my daddy said corruption's a bad
thing
and the people who follow me hate
corruption they don't like a rigged
system
right now they're being nice but they
might not end up being nice i i just i
like to donate
money to her yeah she said that i just
think that like even he doesn't
even have the capacity to say
look they're you know like i mean
he could have answered this like look
there are people out there who have
mental problems
and i can't if my words were twisted
and used by a twisted individual to do
something horrible
i regret that but we have uh problems in
this country
and perhaps my word choice is um you
know uh you know
uh too uh evocative but we have an
evocative situation
and yes i regret that but i will say
this like i cannot be blamed
uh for the deviants of these like
there's there's
there would have been rational
normal ways even if you're as hateful of
a person as he is
to have answered that and he didn't want
to do that he can't do that
i don't know if he can't or won't
because he
feels like i already did the prepared
statement i already did the thing where
you know people could see me my people
could see me knowing that i had to do
the sort of stodgy thing here
and i'm not doing any more than that i
already did it it's unfair
obama would have been like i really
shouldn't have said that i think the
chicago bulls are going to kick ass and
over perform in the postseason
my bad right exactly i might have
contributed to a tenor
and this goes without saying but there's
no evidence that the dayton shooter was
politically motivated he didn't leave a
manifesto
he was not an active uh participant in
antifa
and his his left politics
seem like they are kind of shallow well
it doesn't matter how
shallow or deep his politics are they
didn't motivate there's no reason
whatsoever to assume that they motivated
that attack
if you know if he had attacked a uh
police barracks
or something and uh you know uh well you
know went out with an
a around his back and this and that
those would be clues but
this guy went to a nightclub and
attacked
people including killing his sister so
uh you know we're not one is a situation
where
specifically the shooter himself says
this is why i'm doing it and it has to
do
with these set of politics
uh and this rhetoric that i am parroting
and then the other situation
this guy happened to have politics that
you could perceive as being on the left
given the way that bill barr has sort of
you know politicized the doj and been
you know the roy cohn for the trump
administration
do you see him possibly you know
throwing noise into this by opening a
domestic terrorist claim into ohio i
i wouldn't be surprised because i
noticed they did that with gilroy
um because apparently they found the guy
had a hit list and it must be
there's people on the hit list that must
suggest to him that
the to authorities that like wait a
second this hit list is not random this
hit list
reflects a certain ideology i don't know
the details of the hit list
i would be surprised if barr didn't say
for the sake of due diligence we're
going to do this and just sort of
balance it out
you know and the results will come six
months later and it won't mean anything
and he won't do anything and that's it
um yep that's a very legitimate concern
and which one is this what
what do we still have up there is it
number uh oh
yeah here we go so someone asked him
again about the language
and uh here he goes on um
he still has he knows how he's gonna win
he is
um he is completely singularly
focused on winning by playing
to his constituencies um
racial and xenophobic fears
you and the shooter in el paso use that
same language do you regret that
i think that illegal immigration
you're talking about illegal immigration
yes
i think illegal immigration is a
terrible thing
remind you that the the shooter had the
problem with basically losing our white
identity
we know that his administration has
attacked immigration
period not illegal immigration
only so-called illegal immigration
they have kicked out people who are here
legally because their homes were
devastated and
natural disasters or civil wars
they have made it much harder for people
to get into this country
legally they've detained u.s citizens
they've detained u.s citizens
but continue i think illegal immigration
is a terrible thing for this country
i think you have to come in legally
ideally you have to come in through
merit we need people coming in
because we have many companies coming
into our country they're pouring in and
i think illegal immigration is a very
bad thing for our country
i think open borders are a very bad
thing for our country
and we're stopping we're building a wall
right now we won the lawsuit in the
supreme court two weeks ago
the wall is well under construction it's
being built at a rapid pace
we need that we need strong immigration
laws
but we want to allow millions of people
to come in
because we need them we have companies
coming in from japan all over europe all
over asia
they're opening up companies here they
need people to work we have a very low
unemployment
rate so i believe we have to have
legal immigration not illegally so
i'll remind you the question was you and
the el paso shooter used the same
language do you regret this
and then he went on to lie about a bunch
of different things about
all these companies coming in and then
also say like we need
legal immigration specifically legal
immigration
that um is merit-based well allow me to
use the same language
right exactly of course yeah exactly um
so apparently uh barack obama
tweeted out uh a tweet
essentially saying that um we can't
divide people
we can't be horrible people there's some
amongst us who
are horrible people and everybody knew
that he was talking about donald trump
even the people at the white house
here is um hogan gidley
presidential spokesperson really upset
and remember he knows he's there this
guy used to work for
frank's uh for uh santorum in the um
and santorum also incredible bigot i
don't know if people remember
the stuff he was saying about the blah
people and
um the sodomites and
this guy is there because of
the ability of his buddies to
demonize barack obama
and convince people that
the browns had gotten too much because
they had won the presidency
and uh here he is so he's been waiting
for this let me ask you about more from
the left former president obama
releasing a statement on the mass
shootings and it
took a somewhat veiled jab at the
president writing quote
we should soundly reject language coming
out of the mouths of any of our leaders
that feeds a climate of here
fear and hatred or normalizes racist
sentiments what's your reaction
now what's amazing is they immediately
like
this is thinly veiled at our president
right because he's the one who has
he is definitely one of our leaders who
feeds a climate of fear and hatred
or and normalizes racist sentiments like
they could have their response could
have been like who's he talking about
like why do you think that's about you
rigs exactly
continue if only barack obama were in a
place to make
a difference at some point in his life
wait a minute he was the president of
the united states
for him to interject himself into this
conversation this debate at this point
is his right to do it but the fact is
donald trump is the president of all
americans he's trying to move this
country forward
and comments like that take us backward
and take us to a dark place
that we never want to be and we never
want to visit again
right a dark place where there was like
a
dark cloud and darkened
the white house that was a
dark era it was a dark time
time it was a dark time so
oh so you can't say doc anymore
there you go um
the intolerant left anyways there was a
muslim donkey in the white house
i want to uh
i've got a new answer too for our buddy
who uh didn't want to ban
um didn't want to ban
assault weapons because
banning assault weapons won't help
gun control in any way or won't um
diminish
well i have a new answer and and it was
basically provided to me
by senator pat toomey i'll let pat
toomey explain
part of it the shooter in dayton had
over 240 rounds
at his disposal when he was shot and
killed he had the capacity to kill many
more
are you making any calls or
recommendations
on changing laws pertaining to that so
my focus is on keeping guns out of the
hands of people who
should not have guns people who have no
legal right to a firearm
you know guns that are described as
assault weapons
are almost invariably no more powerful
than ordinary hunting rifles
they they look different you know
they're painted black and they've got
features that an ordinary hunting rifle
doesn't have but they're no more lethal
and what about magazines and they're
extremely popular and so
to to ban an extremely popular firearm
uh i i'm not gonna support that that
would be an infringement on the rights
of law-abiding citizens
there's also five to ten million of them
at least uh already on the streets
and 300 million firearms in total so i
don't know you never get rid of all the
guns and then no one
that's right and it's in the
constitution nor should we become
i love the idea that uh because they're
popular they're in the constitution
they're they're
right because they're popular i mean the
fact of the matter is the supreme court
has ruled
you can ban stuff that is not used in
normal use
and alcohol is pretty popular for women
i thought they ruled that you can't ban
stuff that's popular
well it's true you can't um the supreme
court has ruled
that if it's in within normal use which
is sort of like popular
um you cannot ban it and it's a fairly
relatively new phenomena that these
assault weapons are because there was
a ban on them up until um george bush
reversed it
bless his heart and um
but i would say that to the extent that
you can ban them
as allowed by law um that a bunch of
them are already on the streets
makes no sense as to why you wouldn't
stop more of them coming in
right like you could say like oh my
house is flooded
up until two feet might as well let
another six feet of uh or just a
continual flow of water
blow through my home no you wouldn't say
that
um but i would also say the value
of banning these popular weapons
is it takes market it takes um
a market away from these very very bad
companies that are making uh money
off of the deaths of toddlers
people's suicides obviously these mass
shootings
and the less money they have the less
ability they'll have to impact
our laws and so i think it's just
worthwhile to do that
right there i would just keep i would
ban whatever they're selling that you
can ban
i would ban i just have a problem with
the word
common sense right because when you say
common sense first you sort of have to
ask what common is
do you follow what i'm saying yeah i do
and speaking
how would you define con common oh we're
still doing this would you define
commons freedom
common freedom what is common freedom to
you
common freedom what is common freedom to
you i don't know i have no idea what
common freedom right but then you want
the government to take away people's
guns i mean do you sort of see the
contradiction there i see a little bit
of what you're saying
uh it's common freedom if i wanted to
send my dad
a semi-automatic machine gun and a copy
of hustler
what would this mean for that
i think that guy i hope that guy gets
paid to call this show i really do
um so
i like this idea i like the idea of
shaming people for their participation
in things
i think that is a very healthy thing to
do
now i know the right doesn't like it
because the right feels that it's
unconstitutional to shame people
in fact the right would have you believe
that it's unconstitutional
and it's an assault on free speech to
criticize people
but as you know the supreme court has
essentially ruled that money is speech
and let's say
i am somebody who is a business owner in
let's say a place like el paso
and i'm making a ton of cash off of
the latino community in el paso
and i go out and i take out an ad
that says god bless president trump
let's hope he can do succeed in all his
endeavors
to get rid of all the brown people
or i just say that publicly
well i think you should be called out
for that and
um
it turns out that joaquin castro
congressman uh what did he do buy an ad
no he just posted this oh he posted on
twitter in 2019 these 44 san antonio
donors contributed to the most allowable
by federal law
to in answering the question who's
funding trump
and he put up a bunch of names
um and their companies
that they represent and i think the idea
was
hey all you white people
uh maybe they're not all white it's
conceivable that there's non-white
person there
highly unlikely you're gonna go and
you're going to
max out with donald trump where are you
getting that money
you get it from the community that has
now been
torn apart
by a guy who is inspired by the rhetoric
of your pr
policies and disposition of your
president
that's what he's asking and of course
people absolutely lost it here is
don jr on
fox and friends this is his perspective
on this
and you know i i've seen what these
things do i see you know what's going on
with the joaquin castro craziness
yeah putting out a list i mean that list
sort of screams like the dayton ohio
shooters list
right when when a radical left-wing
politician is polling at about zero
percent does this for either attention
or a call to action it's pretty scary i
mean
visit the
this is a list of 44 uh people from
san antonio who contributed uh the
original
to the president the original quote was
this this is from joaquin castro he
tweeted this
he said sad to see so many san antonios
as 2019 maximum donors to donald trump
the owner of blah blah blah the owner of
blah blah blah the realtor
et cetera their contributions are
fueling a campaign of hate that labels
hispanic immigrants as
invaders so he's not necessarily saying
go and do something dangerous to these
people
it's completely perhaps not to
reasonable people but when
the fringe crazies on both sides and we
saw that
in the last week right you had fringe
crazies on all sides they see that
man you're now you're going after
ordinary citizens people who just are
taking part in a political process
honestly imagine i did that imagine i
put a list of you know joaquin castro's
donors
now our people show this our people
don't weaponize
good point our people don't weaponize
the political system
you know the same way we don't do the
organized boycotts that the left does
in these kind of things are you out of
your mind well first off he's lying
about all that
second off he doesn't realize that
joaquin castro is not running for
president that julian castro is
uh but more more relevantly
and i don't know i i mean i don't know
frankly
if this is something that i would do if
i was a congress person just from a
political standpoint
um i have no problem with someone doing
this
this is all public information you can
find it on a website
you can look it up and all that
information is public
when you donate you know that you're
you're giving that information up
um but
the difference is is that as he
describes what would happen if he did it
he's doing it to weaponize it
castro's doing it to say like look
people should stop supporting your
businesses
is very
very american right like uh
boycotts protests
that's what it's that's the first
amendment right
well it also feeds into the point that i
made a couple days ago
which is that it's hard to say that the
shooter
was a fringe crazy when
his ideology aligns perfectly with that
of many pillars of the community in
which he lives
yeah i mean his his actions are fringe
but the things that drove him are that's
the whole point like the only difference
between him and them is that he took a
gun and killed people
well the ecological part doesn't fit i
mean
that definitely weird well there is
definitely an element
that does not reflect the mainstream
within the far right
at all what's what are you talking about
his manifesto
is a fusion of white nationalist
terrorism and hatred and
profound environmental concerns which
well this you know to me is another
thing that's really just yeah exactly
it's going there i mean we've been
saying
like uh particularly yeah brendan
exactly like
this is another reason why this whole
like accept the science frame
is problematic because people will
accept the science with their
pre-existing
you know biases and politics well this
is something that's been going on for a
really long time
actually like some of the earlier
environmentalists were also big in the
eugenics movement
right and when you're talking about
scarce resources and you have invaders
coming
uh that becomes a problem i mean that's
also he was anti-corporate in it
sort of um in the same way that like say
a tucker carlson was
yeah like the stage is set for some kind
of so vaguely
social democratic eco fashion but here
comes fox news and they have to come
back
and basically pull back a little bit
because
he just compared joaquin castro
publishing the publicly available names
of trump donors to a
the dayton killer's list of of people he
wanted to kill
and uh here's fox and friends trying to
pull him back from that
right either in my opinion so it was
great to see you done and just to
reiterate
uh the hit list from the daytona uh the
guy from dayton was that was a kill list
the castro list was a list of donors
yeah correct but i think the fact that
we're making lists of our political
enemies and trying to create that
narrative
is scary and again if someone on our
campaign did that
it would be rough yeah okay oh yeah we
are gonna get cut off
we're all gonna be marched away
unbelievable
oh well so uh let's hear from joaquin
castro
who is trying to explain to uh morning
joe
the difference between um doxing
which is when you reveal um
private information about people and
providing public information about
people um
all he's doing is he's drawing attention
to the fact and saying like look
your your donation you don't get like
the whole point
that we've heard from the right
in their entire assault on campaign
finance
has been sunlight full disclosure
that's all we need they've since voted
against that but that's it
like people know there's no corruption
because people know
now again i have some questions about a
congressman the efficacy of a
congressman doing this but here he goes
that's right it when you make a
political contribution especially to a
federal candidate
that's a public record and so that
graphic
lists people's names and many of them
are business owners so they actually own
those companies
these are prominent donors most of them
public figures or many of them public
figures
but their money is being taken and used
to fuel
these hateful ads and it has put
millions of people in this country
in fear i mean he
he's right the all that campaign money
went and
was spent on not all of it uh but a
portion of it on 2
000 facebook ads at least that talked
about an invasion
just think of it as a giant yelp review
i mean i thought these guys were all
about the transparency i
this is a super random pull here but i
believe it was
oren hatch when he ran for president for
like two seconds in 2000
was like we don't need campaign finance
reform i've got all my donors on my
newfangled website so you can know
there you go all right well now we know
thank you
congressman castro not gonna do that
again the only uh
the only non-fidel caster i'll give
props for for a long time
um let's hear tucker carlson speaking of
which
now moving to the next phase
um his
his growth and evolution into
a full-on white supremacist and
you know what's fascinating about this
right we have two different things that
are going on here
we have white supremacists
and then we have white supremacist
ideology
and there's two different ways you can
look at
how we get more people
falling into the category in this
country of people who are willing to
get a gun and go out with political
motives to go
shoot someone because they're an
immigrant
or they could be an immigrant or they
look like an immigrant or whatnot
and you can either look at like everyone
in the country lined up on one line
right like a gym class
across the board and
they could all step to the right let's
just look at the conservatives they
could all take
three steps to the right and
the ideology is static the ideology is
the line and how extreme you get
and what extreme actions you're willing
to take
stay static and people move or you could
look at it the opposite way that people
are static
and the ideology floats and more people
are embracing an ideology
and so watch the trick that tucker
carlson does here
because he's going to talk about
self-identified
white supremacists and that it's a hoax
because there's not many of them
what he's not talking about is that
actually what's moved is
the non-self-identified white
supremacists are now
bathing in this ideology and as they
bathe in it
the self-professed uh um
white supremacists have more license to
take action
because more people have embraced the
ideology that inspires them
but the whole thing is a lie if you were
to
assemble a list a hierarchy of concerns
of problems this country faces where
would white supremacy be on the list
right up there with russia probably it's
actually not a real problem in america
the combined membership of every white
supremacist organization in this country
was able to fit inside a college
football stadium
i mean seriously this is a country where
the average person is getting poorer
where the suicide rate is spiking
white supremacy that's the problem this
is a hoax just like the russia hoax it's
a conspiracy theory
used to divide the country and keep a
hold on power that's exactly what's
going on
i wonder if you were to ask a latino
person a person of color
a black person person from pakistan
if white supremacy is a hoax
if it's meaningless if it makes a
difference whether you could
get 70 000 people who call themselves
white supremacists
into a football um stadium first of all
we found out only takes one to take out
30 people
but that aside
and not just to take out 30 people but
to cause
literally hundreds of thousands if not
millions of people to be terrified
but the idea is that what's happening is
that
we have a structures in this country
that
that allow for this and the idea that
it's a hoax of course
i mean now he's just denying i i could i
didn't contribute to anything
because it doesn't exist
it's so creepy lately how he's been
adopting some of the language of the
left
to make very reactionary points right
because he is
naming real problems that exist he's
naming the opioid crisis
which is largely perceived as a white
problem he's naming
people's immigration and lack of jobs
and then he's saying the reason is um
the liberals are claiming that racism is
a thing
and it's dividing people blah blah blah
when in fact
the real thing that's dividing people is
racism itself
right like we talked about that the
other day with the wages of whiteness
and whatnot like this is
it is a hoax of sorts right designed by
the ruling class
to divide us from each other and it's
been working
uh tucker carlson really making some uh
hay out of that whole
russia hoax uh construction
it's just like that
all right speaking of hoax let's just
play this and then we'll get to uh
bernie on rogan that's exciting
um
what is this do we know who she is
uh i do you what do we want to know who
she is
no i guess not but like do we know what
context like was she posting this to
twitter
master and bumble no i did not match
with their own bumble here
pop up this video now where was this
brandon was it just on twitter this was
on twitter
um i believe shared by will summer
and the people who are most chronicling
uh q anon now what i don't understand is
like
is she driving why why is she live
streaming they're
always driving yeah like what's going on
with that
thunderbird i've just arrived in san
francisco
she is in an suv as far as i can tell
looks like with a big
big sunroof not even a sunroof it's
looking like a moon roof
um and
here is i mean this is nuts
and if there's a lot of this going on
out there and there's reason to believe
there is
apparently it was just one of the trump
uh one of the trump
sort of ads they'd ran with like had
multiple sightings of q and
on signs in it because they like this
stuff
it's helpful to them
got to be careful folks because all a
lot of campaigns like this uh conspiracy
theory stuff
but this is scary here is this
random woman who posted this to some
social media i know she live streamed it
or what
but she's explaining questions about q
anon
and um wowza
remember this moment please
remember where you were
and the circumstances very first time
you ever asked
who or what is q
and here's why he focused on the camera
q is u and q
is me q is logic
q is a plan to save the world
q is not a secret but
q is secretive
carefully crafted
secret education
that anyone can have access to
q one day will be
in every history book
q is the best thing that has ever
happened to you
so remember remember this moment
permanently uh
that is the one of the creepiest things
i think i've ever seen like i i when i
first watched that i thought oh god
i know how this ends right she just like
hits a button and the car explodes or
something or she
slams into an oil tanker or something or
and where are you planning on sending
your son to college
what do you mean i'm sorry just you had
a bubble date with that woman
oh oh no no uh i well actually yes i
would be fascinated
but um and also not the i mean that's
super scary oh yeah
because
here is somebody i mean
uh she does not like you know the the
the narrative of the economic anxiety um
she she she's driving what looks like to
me like some big escalade type of thing
yeah
that is trump's base they're not um
unemployed coal miners they're like
small business tyrants driving an
escalator but it's
also stunning that like someone like
that like maybe you know there must be
horrible things going on in her life
that she needs something like that so
no i don't well exactly so that's
actually if you
grow out the conversation that like this
whole like
i mean look i think there's definitely
people in economic anxiety that are
that's a very serious thing i don't want
to discount that right
that's actually matters that that's like
kind of the core of my politics but
if you look at it but the broader
concept of something like alienation
or sociological problems or
psychological
issues and material conditions does not
just mean that somebody's broke
therefore they do act oh absolutely
and that's why i said the other day that
socialism would actually help
the ones on top as well even if they
don't realize it and even if we're gonna
have to fight them
because having a less alienated society
i
have to believe people would there would
be less pinwheel-lied
crazy people talking about q anon maybe
maybe i'm not 100 convinced about that
but um i do think i mean if you look at
places
where though this type of thing
flourishes i mean there's
a lot of broader non-alternatives right
like if you look at
like saudi as an example i mean
there's only like and obviously it's
much more extreme than here but like
there's a reason there's such a
proliferation
of such narrow and wild and extreme
narratives there isn't any other
pressure valves right
and some people believe it or not
experience our own society in the same
way even though obviously there's more
options than saudi but
they have a similar experience yeah
um i mean i think then they adopt the
pre-existing poisons that are already in
the system
yeah i mean i think there is definitely
um
people out there who are overwhelmed by
mardinity and
they want an explanation for everything
and the secret knowledge
provides it i mean i think that's why
people turn to religion
to a large extent too it's like hey i
wake up in the morning
and i got a half a dozen questions i
don't have to deal with
because if i have a set of rules or i
have some type of secret knowledge
that's going to
answer these questions for me when they
come up sometimes it's like what am i
going to wear today
i i don't have to worry about it i'm a
fundamentalist i i
wear the same thing every day um this is
another example of why a left answer can
be
at times you know extremely helpful
because if you have
over complexity and then there's a right
wing narrative that simplifies it in a
toxic
way and then on the other hand there's a
everybody gets health care
we're going to cancel debt you know
there's the appeal or even frankly
that is why 99 verse 1 really is an
enduring beautiful formulation
there's a lot of truth that that covers
and it's not that complicated yeah and
like i keep saying
neoliberal capitalism has destroyed
those old institutions for the most part
that used to give people's lives a
meaning and a purpose
and you know i would argue that those
institutions were oppressive and needed
to go
but we have to replace them with
something else right right
right i mean i'm not sure i mean i think
neo-liberalism may have
uh destroyed those institutions but also
the emancipation of people like
it starts to cut into uh the validity
that you believe in an institution where
they don't accept the fact that you're
actually a full human being
i would imagine a lot of women uh were
like
well there's no doubt about that but i
mean you could shrink it down to like i
mean you read like bowling alone right
right right that's the robert putnam
research on like the collapse of like
people's ability to basically spend
social time and then oh right right
so there's
but third place about things like
religion and
family that's much more and and i think
there's
it's not just a function of of of
of of capitalism that assaulted those i
think
like women decided hey i want to be able
to own my
credit at the same time we have made
some progress in the neoliberal era
it's a limited form of progress and it's
going to be limited no no i'm not saying
i'm saying something different
i'm saying that the reason why those
institutions fell and i agree with you
we need to replace them in some way i'm
not sure what they are but the reasons
why
religion is um
become less attractive to people i think
in an age of marginity is not
necessarily because of capitalism well
do you think that there's not a
neoliberal wing of feminism
there very well may be a neo-liberal
wing of feminism but
any wing of feminism would say hey i
don't like an institution that says that
i can't be
a priest or but that's an example you're
100 but that's also an example of like
sometimes i mean capitalism can
definitely be like a relatively
progressive force obviously
i'm not suggesting that capitalism yeah
i'm not i'm not claiming that
capitalism uh no i know you're not a
role in this one way or another i'm sure
it played on both ends
but my point is is that
i don't think in a socialist country
where you have a religion that
subjugates 50
of the people um that it's going to
survive
well one of the things i'm saying that
might be a little bit is a challenge
if you have you know more socialistic
politics and it's kind of depressing
is i think like definitely at least the
united states some of the
hard fought advances in uh
i'm sorry there was a plastic bag
falling on the window and the women's
movement uh
in terms of going to the workforce also
correlated
with just what needed to happen in terms
of the economy right like
that's like you needed more people
working more jobs and the idea of having
one parent even if you degendered it but
like one person who was a primary
caretaker and another person out working
was absolutely not the post-60s you know
economic arrangement
also during that exactly elizabeth
warren no
world war ii no i'm not talking about
people being mobilized for
war i'm talking about just generally
elizabeth warren wrote about it in the
two-parent trap in 2003
of just basically the idea that you
couldn't you know
one person could work and provide a
middle-class lifestyle in the 50s and
60s right that evaporated yeah and
that's why
it's all connected and it really can't
be disaggregated like
we talked a lot about this with teethy
and chinzia and our feminism for the 99
episode um capitalism it it recuperates
whatever it can so it's great that i
don't have to be
barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen
anymore i like having choices
but then you lose the choice when both
parents have to work and they don't have
a choice
yeah no i get that and i get
the thing that i was commenting on was
that the that it was
neoliberalism that destroyed religion
and other institutions that were
provided social cohesion and i just
don't think that's the case
i mean it may have contributed in some
fashion and maybe it helped
um uh it meant maybe
for for good and for bad but i just
think that
institutions that subjugated
half of the people um
and and more in many respects because
religion has often been used for
racial to justify racial inequality as
well
i think we're doomed to lose adherence
as you know people became a little bit
more
advanced in their thinking about
humanity
and so certainly that as well it's all
connected though
yes everything is connected everything's
connected
all right let's go to um
i'll put up uh we gotta go in ten
minutes folks
i'll put up the ims um callers we're not
going to get to many callers at all
today i'm sorry it's just
just we just take one and run um
let's uh let's take one call and then
we'll get to bernie on rogue and
let's see i took ayahuasca i realized
we're all part of the
same dna structure and it's outrageous
that we don't have a higher ability
to get a lot of people hanging on for
almost 70 minutes uh call them from a
512 area code who's this where you
calling from
hey sam this is uh noah the intern
calling from awesome
noah how are you hey noah
how are you i i didn't i
took my mother's but i didn't hear you i
am doing well i am finishing packing up
to move over to
brooklyn where to brooklyn
yeah i was in brooklyn i'm at school oh
excellent
would you like to do more unpaid work
for
uh us yeah seriously oh well noah come
by the office
yeah i absolutely will okay um
but hey what i wanted to say is uh as an
ammo
phobe i wanted to give you a couple
numbers anyone could do on like gun
control
okay uh because i've been having a i've
been having a fight with some guy on
facebook um so i just used like fbi
statistics from 2017
and then like gun ownership rates and it
turns out that uh
in states with high gun control and low
gun control
there is not really a difference in the
number of guns that are present
but there are statistical differences in
number of deaths
number of deaths by gun number of
suicide rates number of suicide rates by
gun
uh the numbers like are clear that when
you do background checks and when you
like have other
regulations it is safe i'm sure everyone
knows that but like the numbers are easy
to do even for like someone with like
rhythm entries to the sixth skill
um and then talking about like the like
other people will use other things if
you look at the uk
there were 40 000 knife attacks in 2017
but only 280 people died in this there
just is nothing
more dangerous than a gun to use and i
just thought my people should know that
like those are fun things so
uh looking they're not fun there are
things to look into so the the point
being that these reforms
don't necessarily take guns off the
streets as much as they
um they minimize the lethality
of the guns that are out there because
of how uh
people are restricted in their purchase
of it
yeah and like i'm i'm all for the
abolition of all guns to be honest but
if you're talking about like
sensible gun reform it's not a question
of who has the
it's not a question of how many guns
it's the question of who has those guns
when you look at facebook more and more
like
defined and rigorous background checks
it becomes like
infinitely safer it's about three times
as many people die in states with low
background checks and
uh die instead of high background checks
that's why he was our our top intern
folks
noah make sure you reach out when you
get here buddy
yeah absolutely well thank you for
taking the call yeah if you need
anything let us know okay
all right bye-bye absolutely all right
noah the intern
brendan you never met him i did not but
it sounds like i might have the
opportunity to now i hope so
that's very exciting i think his mom had
told us that he was coming to uh
to brooklyn um i can't i
everything is bled together but i'm
pretty sure maybe i maybe i
i dreamt that i don't know
um
all right let's go to uh some let's
let's watch some of this uh
bernie and rogan stuff let's see what do
we got here
um one thing on stock speculation tax
that rogan is kind of impressed by
if something on
redefining american greatness and then
ufos
wait where oh here is the stock
speculation came in after
oh okay okay okay that's where i get
confused all right let's let's listen to
number 10. this is um
this is a big deal i mean it's good that
uh bernie goes on the show
this is one of the biggest shows that
are out there
of people um who are
i mean just broadly speaking it's one of
the biggest uh you know podcast
online shows that exist i mean i don't
know you know the specific
numbers but very close consistently on
the top of the
podcast charts and on youtube it's huge
and um it's good news it means that uh
bernie's out there
looking for uh votes where he can find
it he also
of all the the shows that he could have
gone on to reach
these people this is the best of those i
think um
and certainly uh joe rogan
on the uh in the wake of uh talking to
cornell west
you know i think is like um
at least at least exposing his uh
listeners and viewers to
a whole new set of assumptions and ideas
this is not addressed when we talk about
making america great
wouldn't like fixing the worst parts of
the country be the primary concern
the the less people that grow up in a
terribly disadvantageous position
from birth wouldn't that be an important
thing and what can you do
to resolve that well trouble i think you
you know you said it better than i can
i think you're right you know when we
talk about what it means to live in a
great
society a great nation a nation that
we're proud of
i'm afraid there are some people who
have incredible wealth
and power who say you know what's great
is that we're seeing
a growth in the number of billionaires
in america isn't that terrific
and we got one guy who's worth 155
billion dollars how great
oh by the way we're building more
nuclear weapons
and we're spending 750 billion dollars a
year on the military isn't that
extraordinary and by the way you see the
yacht that that billionaire has
you know it's three miles long isn't
that great your point is that we have to
i think as i understand what you're
saying
we have to redefine what being a great
nation is about
we are not a great nation when we have
40 million people living in poverty and
in despair
we're not a great nation when we have
massive levels of income and wealth and
equality when 87 million people can
afford
to go to a doctor today so to answer
your question
i think that as a nation we have got to
focus a great deal of attention on those
distressed communities
often they're african-american often
they're latino often they are rural
white communities
and that means making sure that the kids
they get the quality education
that they deserve making sure that we're
creating
good paying jobs in those communities i
voted against
nafta permanent normal trade relations
with china
and other trade agreements because i
knew that those agreements were written
by corporate america
with the goal of shutting down plants in
this country and moving abroad
and the result of that has been the loss
of millions of good-paying jobs
and the complete destruction of
communities
all across this country in the south and
all across this country
um and and
you know what's what's fascinating to me
is that
and i don't get a sense of where rogan
is on this
like to how much you know what um
and and i'm i'm using rogan only as
a as a surrogate for uh some
cohort of his audience sure there's a
bunch of his audience that don't care
i'm sure there's a bunch of his audience
that sit and refute what bernie says but
there's a bunch of his audience
that i think are probably you know like
joe probably wondering like wait a
second
how does the idea
of measuring the greatness of the
country
as a function of how well it does for
the most amount of people possible
versus how well it does
how far into the stratosphere we can
send specific individuals
right like in in the context of
healthcare like
do we have a great health care system if
princes
from foreign countries come here
to get a liver transplant or whatever it
is
some type of procedure they can't get
anywhere else
or do we have a great health care system
because
the entire population has better health
better outcomes etc etc now
these notions
i don't know if they're mutually
exclusive but in the context of our
system they seem to be
because when you incentivize
providing super
uber care for the wealthiest amongst us
that's where your resources go and
they're not spread around
now maybe there's a system maybe where
you could have
the the best in the world and provide to
the most
people it's not inconceivable i don't
know how durable that would be
but so what so what
the question is how are you going to
measure
what is the definition of a great
country
is it one that produces
you know the the most
billionaires and has the most
elite healthcare and
has you know i don't know it's like how
do you judge whether a country uh
creates longevity do you measure the
oldest living person or do you average
it out amongst the entire population
in bernie's mind i would argue probably
everyone here too it is
when you average it out are you is
everybody participating
in the success of the country and and
the the more people you have
participating in the success of a
country of a society
that's the definition of success
and many of the people who go on that
show
say the opposite they don't they don't
they're not
quite explicit about it
but all of the examples they cite of our
greatness as a nation
are a function of what an individual
can do
we can allow we can we can grow the
biggest
billionaire in the world i mean it's
like
okay am i going to dedicate my garden to
growing the biggest
watermelon and suck all the resources
out from the entire
garden into creating this one big melon
which if you know anything about a
watermelon you got a certain limited
amount of time where you can eat it
and if you can't eat all of it then most
of it's going to go to the waste
or am i going to have just a series of
smaller watermelons throughout the
garden
that we can pluck and enjoy watermelons
through a much longer season
i'm just saying that because i it's very
evocative well i had a lot of
watermelons for the kid today i got
i got like a seedless one that goes like
this and a yellow one but
i mean that's basically what it comes
down to and it's fascinating
it's going to be fascinating to see like
what this does to uh rogan's outlook
because only presumably right there's
it's some reflection on what's happening
with his audience and we're talking
about several million people
so that's not an insignificant number of
people
yeah like i could actually see this
moving the needle for bernie a little
bit
who knows considering how huge his
audience is who knows and how many
uh downwardly mobile millennial males
are probably in it yeah i mean i don't
know i have no idea i mean if uh i would
be surprised
to help it's super smart i would be
surprised if somebody come to me and
said like oh did you know that rogan's a
key demo 70 of his audience is like
women from ages
of 38 to 48. if someone told me that i
would be
really surprised so joe the first time i
was
doing dmt we were in burlington it was
outside of a ski lodge great mountains
great air changed there i'm there i
looked inside of her and i realized
we're all part of the same dna structure
and if we're all part of the same dna
structure why should jeff bezos
take up so much more of that dna it's
really a very simple concept if you
think about it
we have one more clip on that what was
the other clip with the uh wall street
yeah okay and and i imagine we're going
to see
a along the themes of the clip that we
just watched where
we define success based upon how many
people
enjoy that success versus how many
people what
what what what size of success a limited
few
enjoy um here's bernie
talking to wall street in one piece of
legislation or two
actually is to make public colleges and
universities tuition free cancel all
student debt in this country
that will cost 2.2 trillion dollars a
lot of money over a 10 year period
we do this through attacks on wall
street
speculation which will bring in 2.4
trillion dollars
we bailed out wall street 11 years ago
and by the way these are crooks on wall
street who
engaged in legal behavior taxpayers
against my vote
bail them out if we can bail out wall
street you know what we can cancel
student debt and provide
public colleges and universities
tuition-free when you say
a tax on wall street speculation what
exactly do you mean it will be a tax on
uh all of the tr every sale of attacks
you
people buy and sell stocks and bonds all
of them we have a very modest tax on
that
and by the way it will have an impact on
speculation by cutting back on the high
frequency trading which we now see
so you would just there is there's no
current tax on correct
so you would put a small amount and that
would do the job that would
raise more than enough money it's a very
small tax it exists it says
how much it depends on on the nature of
the transaction but it's less than one
half of one percent
really yeah and that because yeah
because the amount of stocks being sold
and so and this is not again a new idea
it's being done in countries all over
the world
there it is i mean the financial
transaction tax
it is essentially like um like
like a sales tax except for it's much
smaller uh because there's so many of
these transactions
understand too that a lot of these
transactions are actually run by
machines
um and um maybe the majority
i don't know like just automatic uh
programs that just run and there is a
the cutting into the amount of
speculation
uh and the amount of trades would uh
undoubtedly be
a um a benefit to uh
the stability i guess of the of the
market um but
nevertheless it's like look the theory
has always been like if the stock market
is doing well then the
country's doing well well no that's
there
there's no there's less and less
correlation and
uh this could actually be a way of
correlating it a little bit
um because there will be a material
benefit
to the benefit that people are getting
on
uh wall street lastly
let's just play this last clip from
bernie um this could be the one that
ends up getting him
the most votes on uh uh on his
appearance on rogan
and that this is where uh things get a
little freaky deaky
so i'm gonna let you go because i know
you got very important things to do one
last question
if you got into the office and you found
out something about aliens
if you found out something about ufos
would you let us know
well i'll tell you my wife would demand
that i let you know does your wife a ufo
nut
no she's not at the ufo which is bernie
what is going on do you have any access
to the records
you don't have any access i don't
honestly i don't know okay you let us
know though
all right i'll be on the show we'll
announce it on the show please all right
thank you sir appreciate you all right
all right joe we gotta we should have
asked him to do that on
on this show would you literally save
that one for last
in case he decided that question was
stupid it stormed out
right smart uh there it is bernie so
uh another reason to vote for bernie he
will let you know about the ufos
all right i'm gonna race through some
items and then we gotta get going
they're aliens
they're aliens i can't keep it secret uh
drunk dalek
uh phone callers we're just not we'd
we're out of time i apologize
sad noise drunk dalek uh sam about your
interview yesterday there i did i
ww folks in portland organizing fast
food workers burgerville workers union
was the first nationally recognized fast
food union
check out boycottburgerville.com
dave released a video talking about how
progressives and liberals criticizing
him induce temporary
alopecia because of how stressful the
experience was and almost ended his
career he says he wrote it about
wrote about it in his new book i wonder
if he names names or he's still going to
pretend
majority port and sam cedar do not exist
it'll be interesting
water boat from cashmere i was planning
to call in to talk about cashmere but
i'm too
stressed to talk about it now there's
too much people don't know about
cashmere and the western press has done
a shameful job over the past three
decades which is a reason why these
fascists in delhi
feel emboldened to do this but here are
some things i'd point out from the
point of view of kashmiris all the unu
resolutions promising referendum were
kept at bay by india through this uh
autonomy india's fig leaf of legality
for occupation is gone
for kashmiris it's an entirely illegal
occupation now seriously
two there's a complete information
blackout and arrests of kashmiri leaders
even the ones that were historically
aligned with india
even they are calling for this
occupation to end now those arrested
include
former chief ministers and one of whom
was in a coalition with bjp
you have over a half a million troops in
paramilitaries in indian kashmir uh with
another four divisions of paramilitaries
brought in
over the past two weeks so an extremely
hostile population with information
blackout by law no accountability for
soldiers and paramilitary seriously no
one can prosecute indian forces in
kashmir by law
just think of what atrocities come with
that kind of impunity
the dereliction of duty by western press
is the reason why you don't know the
boots of fascists are doing they didn't
report the magnitude of atrocities
during the trial runs
the last three decades national
organizations in india are already
asking to bring
millions of poor patriots to colonize
cashmere this is ethnic cleansing
there's a deep calm before the storm in
cashmere this coming friday
and eid on sunday is going to be very
hairy it's like tibet
uh i will just say watch the stream i do
at murtaza hussein last night we we
covered a lot of basic grounds
who do you have tomorrow are you going
to talk to somebody about this tomorrow
i wasn't booked for tomorrow we did it
on tmbs but i
yeah i'll cover it more tomorrow we
don't have a guest but i'll definitely
cover it
tuck face hot carlson it seems to me
very harsh towards dave when yesterday's
excellent guest referred to jobs
made to require neither skill nor
thought being as reubenized
a square sam that last i am or last week
captured my sentiment add the hunting of
latinx and it all seems to be gloom and
doom except for the puerto rican
mass protest and results shofar for
boricas
i know you can pronounce it better than
that
i can't uh maybe i'm projecting but from
uh
your interviews convos and body language
and tone the past weeks it seems you're
also more discouraged than ever
it's been a little tiring we surely need
a judy gold friday we just had one
congressional baseball fan i'm currently
listening ideas for what has to be done
when you're just out minding your own
business playing ball 30 50 feral hogs
run into a shallow left field
uh anarchy in the
tagatta given the history of racism and
police forces isn't it likely that gun
control legislation will be used as a
pretense to harass poor black
neighborhoods in the same way
drug legislation does yes origin of stop
and frisk is gun stuff
bravo matic wheat is also very popular
so clearly we cannot regulate it
colorado guy corporate media is willing
to use video games as a scapegoat for
facts and mass violence but somehow
never manages to mention the military
industrial complex or the fact that u.s
has been at war for 90 percent of its
history
brandon i was telling my dad recently
about the u.s plan with guatemala to
start making black sites and
move camps there and then he asked me a
question i exactly know how to answer he
asked me
where do they uh do this sort of refugee
vetting ineffective and more importantly
a moral way
in the us the way that we did it
we did it here and we would just release
them into the community we had a 95
percent uh return rate particularly when
they had lawyers
magnum's uh khloe biden down to 25
latest poll it depends on what poll
you're looking at from the new york
times
i'm michael barbero this morning i
listen to the am quickie in my podcast
feed and
brief introduction to the news with the
catchy tune how original heads up sam
when you come at the king you best not
miss it it's wednesday august 7th that's
funny
tasteful palette of the 1970s hey sam
can you help uh
settle two important pressing issues
first are goldfish crackers for adults
or children children
we had a party and host put out a plat
of goldfish crackers next to a bowl of
hummus would you dip it the goldfish in
the hummus
yes too small producer lauren according
to chuck carlson last night there was
near riot at the dsa convention over the
accommodating transgender and autistic
members that's
of course oh my god everyone can calm
the down about that like
seriously let's um also uh
lay off the language uh brock from va
gren kessler uh fact check henny said we
should put
armed guards at every building yes that
would be harder and less efficient i
understand
fisherman's friend the cute lady is a
doctor with surprisingly she's not also
selling homeopathics
just give it time and the final i am of
the day
empire burlesque so i'll vote for joe
biden i don't want to have to but i will
however
do you think it's better to
strategically keep that to myself or
even lie about it
and say i will do not so such thing um
i think keeping it to yourself is
probably not a bad idea
i don't know if i would go out and say
that you're not going to do
that because that's going to encourage
people to not do that and you don't have
control over what they do
when push comes to shove but i think
keeping it to yourself
being coy about it we'll see is a good
oh i don't know who i'll vote for
i don't know what who be
joe biden i don't know
see you tomorrow
to get to where i want
but i know somehow
i'm gonna get
won't make me feel any better
is
breaks here
do you know how far the teacher takes
you
is
you
