joining me today is a writer and
activist and the founder of theory of
enchantment dot com chloe valderrie
welcome to the reuben report thank you
for having me i'm very happy to have you
here because you are one of i don't know
i'd say 12 people online that don't make
me completely insane like i look at your
twitter feed and i'm like oh
there's someone with a brain that's
actually not completely insane thanks
yeah that's the highest compliment i can
give anybody i try
so actually we met a couple months ago
in september at a jordan peterson event
yes would you say that was the best
white supremacist event you were ever
excellent excellent i mean
just yeah i was terrified yeah before we
get into your history and everything
else and you're doing you're doing truly
so much great work um what do you make
of the peterson phenomenon because so
many of my guests i'm finding are coming
to shows right and it's like right it's
pretty cool i understand jordan peterson
like fundamentally i understand what
he's doing um i think that
i think that he is compelling to many
people because
in many cases
he's a storyteller he's a great
storyteller and what he can do is he can
distill lessons from stories um stories
found in pop culture stories
that are
history and and derive lessons that you
can apply to your life and i think that
anyone who can do that will be
compelling because they can actually
better your life and i think that's the
secret as to why he's so
uh popular and also i've noticed that
he's be i think he's becoming more
mainstream like he's becoming more
acceptable into in mainstream society
which is which is a positive trend like
seeing him
being interviewed on dr oz for example
was like a moment i think
of him inching closer and closer to the
mainstream what's that phrase first they
ignore you then they mock you and then
they want to be you something like that
so he may be in that version
yeah all right well speaking of stories
tell me a little bit about your story
who the hell are you oh yes i am chloe
i'm from new orleans originally born and
raised um my story i guess is an
interesting one i was born and raised in
a very atypical christian family
atypical in the sense that i grew up as
a christian observing shabbat
yeah so so what is that what is that so
the way i like to tell it is you know
have you heard of seven-day adventists i
have so it's like seven-day adventists
but on steroids
essentially that's how i grew up so
seven-day event is to my understanding
they keep shabbat that's why they call
them the seventh day so they go to
church on saturday instead of sunday
so we did that also but we also
did things like we observed yom kippur
and rosh hashanah
and all the jewish holy days and we also
kept kosher style so i don't eat pork or
shellfish
and that was an interesting upbringing i
have two funny stories to tell you um
the first is about yom kippur yeah so as
i'm sure you know in the jewish
tradition i've
done it once or twice right yeah so can
you tell me what age one begins fasting
for yom kippur
well there's an obvious answer here that
obviously can't be the right answer but
i would assume thirteen yeah
oh okay yeah yeah so you're pulling a
little trickery on me okay
okay like bar mitzvah okay um well my
parents didn't have the rabbinical text
to advise them on like what age they
should make their kids start fasting um
and so for some reason they decided that
five years old would be a good time to
so i've been fasting for yom kippur
since i was five oh man so
yeah so you're an old pro now yes yes
um so that's like one quick story of how
i grew up and then my father introduced
me to the writings of leon eures when i
was 15 years old so he was a really
famous jewish author who wrote a lot
about the reestablishment of the state
of israel he wrote books like exodus and
qb7 and miller 18
and i read all these books throughout
high school
and was part of the hebrew culture club
in high school went to a very
egalitarian high school in new orleans
yeah um so this is sort of my
introduction to the world of
jewish culture but also israel in a
contemporary sense yeah and then i
attended the university of new orleans
where i initially majored in film
but then switched majors to
international studies in 2012. graduated
magna laude yes
i had to think about it yes
yes
um but the reason why i switched majors
was because anti-semitism was
resurfacing in europe in in france in
particular yeah so this is about what
seven eight years ago this is 2012. yeah
okay yeah so and i wanted to get
involved in the israel space so that's
why i switched majors and i started a
student pro-israel organization on
campus
um did israel advocacy for three and a
half years
realized that we didn't know what we
were doing but i learned a lot from that
experience um
and that was my college experience yeah
okay so we're going to get to obviously
a lot of the advocacy work that you do
and some of the things that you've
written and all that but just a little
bit more on the on the growing up part
because there's something really
fascinating there it's like it's sort of
for you it's like oh well this is how i
grew up it kind of is what it is but it
sounds for other people it's like wait a
minute so she's christian but was
celebrating all these jewish holidays
like how how was that explained to you
as a child or is was it explained to you
yeah i mean it was like it was like the
explanation was this is how jesus and
the disciples observed
so we're gonna observe in this way that
was like the basic explanation and then
like
just growing up you know you're
conditioned to do these things and so it
just becomes rote and becomes like basic
but like you're saying it doesn't make
sense to a lot of people looking from
the outside in so yeah yeah okay so
college you started realizing that that
the things that you had grown up around
that something was sort of under assault
sort of is that fair to say
yeah i think yeah and i think that
because um
you know anti-semitism is fundamentally
like dehumanization of jews and because
i had grown up with such a not just a
like a love for the jewish people but an
awareness of jewish culture like to a
certain extent i've my identity was
defined by jewish culture or adjacent to
jewish culture so i think in that sense
it did feel like something a part of me
was under attack so that was probably a
huge catalyst for getting involved what
did the
like your jewish friends think about
this girl that you know doesn't
stereotypically look jewish which is a
ridiculous thing to say of course
because there are black jews and latino
jews and chinese jews right and
everything else right um did your
friends think like what what is this
thing in college college growing up
whatever it is well growing up it
i don't i don't know if they if they
thought any different i don't remember i
just remembered that the jewish kids and
myself were not in school during rosh
hashanah yeah
we were just out of we were just absent
at the same time yeah and college
i just made all my pretty good if you
want a couple extra days off very good
very good i mean i didn't even talk
about what you could that's a whole
other story uh
but in college
my friend i just made my friends join my
club
so they like i just made them like there
was no like oh this is it was just who i
was and like a part of you know my life
yeah so it seems to me that right now i
guess campus anti-semitism is sort of
running rampant i think it has a lot to
do with bds and we can talk about that
and more but what were you actually
seeing back then that were the markers
yeah i mean back then so there wasn't a
lot of there wasn't like
systemic anti-semitism at the university
of new orleans um or for example at
tulane where i did a lot of uh
pro-israel stuff also
um
but actually what i discovered was
though there was anti-semitism on
certain campuses certain hot bay
campuses like colombia and uc irvine and
we've heard about all these different
campuses where there are you know
problems
the larger issue
was that we in the community were
confusing two different things we were
confusing two very important questions
with each other the first question was
how do you combat anti-semitism which is
a noble question a good question a
question that got me involved
with the question of how do you actually
get people to fall in love with israelis
and we were confusing those two
questions
and as a result we were coming we were
we were shaping the basis of our
advocacy around uh the wrong assumptions
so like the first question how do you
fight anti-semitism is essentially a
question of how do you get people to
stop hating but the second question how
do you get people to fall in love with
israelis or israeli society is a
question of how do you get people to
start loving which is a totally
different question
and we we and i say like collectively we
the prorational community in america
hadn't figured that out and so as a
result we were doing pro-israel advocacy
where we were putting together
projects within the realm of pro-israel
advocacy that didn't make sense yeah and
that was the larger trend that i
observed that i witnessed when i was in
college all right so let's do both of
those so first how do you deal with
disassembling anti-semitism or just
hatred in general
well i think so i think they're
interconnected on some level i think
um
it's not just enough to
to
continue to tell people to stop hating
obviously that's important but you also
have to create a framework and create
sort of like a
a
collection of lessons if you will on how
to start loving on how to love if you
will
um and so i so that i think that that
actually ends up combating anti-semitism
and combating all forms of hatred if you
actually build out a framework or try to
teach people how to love
do you think there's something unique
about
hating jews that's a little bit
different than hating other people like
sort of partly
historical reason yeah because it goes
back forever basically but also that i
find right now i mean most of the people
that hate me are on the left let's say
so i get a relentless amount of hate
from them and i don't i don't get a lot
of hate from the right but every now and
again when i get a hate hatred from the
right it's oh you jew blah blah blah
that kind of thing yeah
for in my case it's very
disproportionate on one side and that
probably has more to do with my politics
but i do think it's interesting that
it's sort of it is that horseshoe theory
where the people on the fringes both end
up
hating you for identity right uh that's
a good question but i think
anti-semitism is like uniquely a problem
or uniquely different i mean if you were
to look at intersectionality for example
which is this i was hoping we'd get to
it yeah my favorite time yeah let's do
it um
can you explain let's let's let's steal
man intersectionality give me can you
give me what the the person out there
that's the believer in intersectionality
what would they tell you
intersectionality is before we knock it
down right i think i can still imagine
it i mean i'd say that intersectionality
makes three claims one of which is true
um the first claim that it makes is that
you can you can experience intersecting
forms of oppression so i as both a woman
and a person of color can experience
forms of oppression by virtues of those
categories to which i belong and they
can inter intersect and interact with
each other in new ways and i think for
the record i've been conducting this
interview as if you were a white man
i just want to be clear because i'm
trying not to thank you so much
such a relief um okay but you've got
these you've got these two immutable
characteristics basically that could
intertwine based in their outsider
characteristics right right so like
a person a man could be sexist toward me
or a white person could be racist toward
me right and then and then both of those
types of uh discriminations or
prejudices can interact in different
ways which i think is a basically true
statement right
um
so
that is the extent to which i can still
manage your sexuality okay now now give
me now give me the knot
right
um the not so true and actually i would
say dangerously false claims of
intersectionality
one is that the primary motivator
behind all human interaction is power
and by power they mean like the
power
in order to oppress
um
so i could be having a
disagreement political disagreement with
you in good faith
but according to the intersectionalists
it doesn't matter because you have white
skin and i have brown skin and so you by
virtue of the category that you exist in
you are trying to oppress me right and
in this case my gayness would fall below
the importance right of say my white
skin exactly and intersection on the
scale of intersectionality jewishness is
completely sort of thrown out which i
think is related to the israel thing
which well
definitely like hierarchies of what
like virtues and stuff like that or lack
thereof in your case
i'm just me what can i tell you so
that's the that's the
first uh dangerous claim that it makes
and then
the second conclusion i guess you would
say to which it comes
is a conclusion of racial essentialism
so what that means is you could take any
human basic human behavior let's say
feeling entitled right so
my friend could have a new iphone x and
for some reason
like
i don't have the money to buy the iphone
x but i want the iphone x whatever i'm
coveting right yeah this iphone x if you
will so i feel a sense of entitlement to
it right so any human being can feel a
sense of entitlement right that's my
point but the intersectionalists will
will claim
that entitlement
like a priori is the white man's thing
so they will refer to entitlement as
white male entitlement as if the only
type of human being
that can feel or express a behavior of
entitlement is a white male
um and so in doing that they are
uh racially essentializing people they
are taking human behaviors and turning
them into essential characteristics of
people that belong to one category
so as somebody that comes from a unique
religious perspective what do you make
of the religious nature of the people
that buy into this ideology it's a good
question i mean it's it's like like many
religions it is all-encompassing
um
like many well certainly like certain i
would say
uh mainstream forms of christianity it
sort of preaches this born-again type
mentality where you become woke right
which is just another word for
enlightened right that's what they think
you're gonna say annoying but okay
no but like the parallels are like
you've become well you've been born
again you've become um
um the problem well one of the many
problems is that there's no salvation
there's no redemption in this religion
you get
brownie points or virtue points if you
are
if you belong to certain categories like
if you're a person of color if you're a
woman etc
and you get less points if you're white
if you're male
if you're straight etc etc
and what this does is it has a
caricaturing effect on on human beings
where people are reduced to caricatures
uh it creates this effect where the
people who are intersectionalists and
who who believe in this theory um
are
sort of incapable of dealing with nuance
and dealing with depth and human
complexity which is sad not just for the
people that they're attacking but for
themselves
do you think it's an overstep to call it
the new type of racism because i'm
really coming around to that you're like
edging frank yeah like i'm like right
there on that i've said it once or twice
i don't really like saying it because i
don't i don't want to start using the
tactics which i hate so much right of
course i don't want to do that but uh i
don't know if you saw my my episode with
her in uh august i had catherine burble
sing who's a wonderful teacher at
michaela school in the uk okay and
she flat out and she's of brown skin and
you know the whole thing
but she doesn't buy into any of this
nonsense and she was adamant in saying
this is the new racism and we must call
it that
and i i agree with the heart of the
sentiment and i just adore her and i was
i spoke in school a couple weeks ago but
but i'm a little leery of why are you
leery of it
because i don't want to fall into the
same trap that they've come in where
every time i hear one of their arguments
the idea would be that i could just turn
to them and be like well you're the new
racist you know what i mean where
because it's just it's right and shut it
down it's so easy and lazy and the rest
of it so i don't i don't want to do that
and yet if i see the way the world is
now where i see
true racism coming from it's almost
exclusively coming from these people i'm
not saying that there aren't some white
nationalists there are some they have no
power nobody cares about them they're
mocked and they're they're actually
propped up by the media to make it seem
like they're running the world yeah but
where i see true racism coming from
these days and a true hatred based on
immutable characteristics is this set of
intersectional woke people i just don't
want to be i just don't want to be
that right right that's a very good and
deep question i think that
for my purposes
i don't just want to
like i want to criticize in a in a
meaningful way
so i would have to ask the question
will i get people who believe in
intersectionalist theory to change or
convince them to change simply by
calling them racist probably not
probably not right it's not when they
call all these people on the right they
call basic conservatives or libertarians
racist it's not like they're coming
around right so it's not like they're
like oh yes you're right i should just
be an intersectionalist
i am woke
i am now born again no it doesn't it
doesn't work though yeah so so
i think
i would rather
challenge people who believe in this
theory on their own terms
um
do you get a unique cred to do that
because of your
so how does it how does that how does
that work that you can almost use their
own
crappy thing against them in a bizarre
way even though you don't believe in it
there's a unique power there i suppose
but i think but i think what i do is i
convey
depth meaning i think i am an example of
human complexity
so on the surface level i am using their
own
uh hierarchy of virtuous people or
virtuous types against them but at the
same time i think i'm showing them what
that human complexity actually exists
because i disagree with them so it's
like a cognitive dissonance thing that
they have to figure out
but i'm more interested in people in in
trying to challenge people who believe
in this especially young people let's
say because on the college campuses and
such
become better people
um and i have to in order to do that i
have to criticize them in a way that
actually speaks to their potential to be
better people i mean like i said i'm not
going to accomplish that by calling them
racist but what i can do is try to i can
try to for example point them to
i think authors and and
people in literature for example who
they highly esteem
um whose
work they don't
quite yet realize is not intersectional
so who who might that be perhaps maya
angelou for example um i think that
there is a very stark contrast between
like ta-nehisi coates and maya angelou
the very first
poet i was forced to memorize as a child
was maya angelou and so like i feel like
i i carry her spirit with me
and the way she talks about human
complexity and
the way she talks about
how nobling the human spirit is is
in many ways a contrast to
intersectionalist theory
she famously one time said that
shakespeare must have been a black woman
because the and and because like one of
his sonnets she she felt so closely
and intimately connected to in the
struggles that she was going going
through as a child and her point was
that
um
all of this literature
uh if even if it comes from like let's
say the dead white male right
was written for all of you for each of
you and you can see yourself in that in
the stories that these great
writers created and that's the point
that's what makes them great writers is
the fact that you can see yourself in
them so i would point people toward
especially her work because they
typically and generally esteem her and
they consider her to be
um
an icon and i think she was an icon but
then that can use that to actually teach
them well here's an alternative way of
thinking actually and what you're
learning in your post-structuralist
class about like human life and human
affairs isn't necessarily
um true and it isn't it isn't the only
thing out there what do you make of the
fact that it seems like so many young
people are going to college so
ill prepared to deal with the world as
it is that they become
so religious in nature when it comes to
this stuff like if they had been given
better tools perhaps some of the things
that jordan peterson's talking about
that they could go into school and be
challenged and be okay with it as
opposed to going in and converting
seemingly
i guess that's a parent problem
on some level it's a parent and a parent
yeah
um
yeah i mean i think
i i think it's a question of upbringing
obviously
um
but i also think
i i think that maybe it signifies that
students are searching for meaning i
mean students are searching for meaning
i was searching for meaning in college
you know um we're searching for meaning
all of our lives right and then what
does it say that
that
the only thing that's seemingly out
there that's giving them meaning at
least within the college context is
intersectionalist theory i mean like
surely we as a society can do better
than that but i think that jordan
peterson represents this
this contrast because he is getting a
lot of fame and popularity he is
considered to be popular among some
people many people in college probably
so i think that in that sense um maybe
they're not being as converted as as
much as as much as uh it seems they are
maybe there is a there is a battle of
ideas of the hearts and minds of these
students so that's a good thing well
there's i mean there's definitely
statistical evidence that that's true
right there was that study that came out
a couple months ago that basically only
eight percent
of young people actually are these
hysterical shrieking intersectionalists
right but because they're so loud
they're just silencing the majority so
that's encouraging well that so that
means it's our fault because right well
that's what i always say people every
event i go you're not being loud enough
really well that's the funny thing it's
like every literally every event i go to
from the peterson event that you were at
in long island to all when i do stand-up
gigs whatever it is people come up to me
after they go what can i do what can i
do and the only thing that i can come up
with that has any meaning whatsoever is
start speaking right like you live in
the freest society in the history of the
world and you're afraid to say what you
think yeah how would you be in one of
the bad places yeah you know and also
like with social media we all have our
own media companies now like anything is
possible yeah so
yeah i think i think we need to start
speaking more but i also think we need
to
like i said earlier we need to emphasize
like it's not enough to tell people how
to stop hating we also have to teach
them how to start loving and i think
that that's something that needs to be
developed further also all right so
let's put the start loving
part on hold for a minute because that
seems like a good ending to me so let's
put that to the end okay yeah i've
noticed you you've been pretty critical
about what's going on in the women's
march and we're and i think we're
starting to see which i think is
positive that this intersectional
sort of hierarchy or
monster i think is a better word that it
can't hold very long and i think we're
seeing the evidence of that now can you
explain a little bit of why that is have
you seen the article that came out
yesterday in tablet about the women's
march i've had a crazy couple days here
so okay
so
all this time you know
we had this suspicion that the
leaders in the women's march including
tamika mallory linda sarsour and carmen
perez were sort of like
pretty
like anti-semite anti-semitic like
hub-nubbing with ferracon and uh
posting very positive remarks about fair
con on their social media platforms
right when you say we you mean like us
and the
whatever you want to call that subset of
people not not what mainstream portrays
them sure but i would say i'd say
that this has been a concern in the
jewish community by and large for a very
long time um like the majority of jews
in this country are pro-israel right and
so they
so collectively the pro-israel community
has had a creeping suspicion about
these women's intentions when they come
when they came to
allowing jews to march or like telling
jesus to have a safe place to march or
even a space to march
in the women's march and i'm actually
part of a
organization called zion s which tries
to give a space to progressive jewish
women to march in these women's in these
women's marches even though linda are
sort of shouting at them you there's no
room for you here right yeah um so the
idea is like oh you're not going to give
us the table we'll build our own table
but what's interesting
is that yesterday this bombshell report
came out in telemazing
and
our worse suspicions were confirmed
um i did see a little bit it's actually
about the security and everything yeah
so go ahead so
apparently i'll say
allegedly at the very first meeting with
these women um who were being added to
as i guess as co-chairs to the women's
march there was there were anti-semitic
statements made about jews um and and
consistently throughout their time as
co-chairs um
there was a legend they've allegedly
been hiring uh
security folks from the nation of islam
fair consummation nation of islam
for those of you who may be watching who
don't know fair khan has famously uh
referred or infamously referred to jesus
termite i mean he's a notorious
anti-semite yeah so it turns out that
he's on twitter no problem yeah yeah you
can check him out
[Laughter]
we'll link to his twitter right down
below right exactly yeah so these women
have been hiring security guards from
nation of islam
to do their security detail at the
women's march and so it's a really
bombshell report i encourage your
viewers to read it but yeah we actually
will link to that okay
not to farrakhan's twitter but we will
put a link to the article yeah yeah and
it is like a
it's a it's a it's a crazy moment so so
does this seem like it obvious to you in
a way like
it sort of seems obvious to me that that
two three years ago there were a bunch
of us i think sort of old school decent
liberals that were like this thing this
marriage in hell between the women's
march and sarsour like this thing can't
hold of course this is going to happen
right so like i think there's a little
bit of like i told you so here for some
of us it definitely is i mean i posted
this on my facebook yesterday and i
definitely got some of that so
so
but that doesn't make you feel any
better right though it's not like you're
like ah
see i'm nostradamus over here right
right i mean i guess one just hopes that
people who are leaders would have the
integrity and responsibility and
introspection to not do this so what do
you think has to happen then for the
women's march to move forward with with
whatever the goodness of that is right i
i think well we for example i decided
i'm not marching in the women in the in
any march affiliated with the women's
march inc which is which is the
organization that those women sit on the
board of um so i'm just not gonna and
there are other marches there there are
other individual marches that have
actually cut ties with women's march inc
that people can still march with if they
feel so inclined but as far as that
particular organization
is concerned i'm not i'm not marching
with them anymore so is the inherent
problem of sort of just collectivism as
a as a
ideology that to say a woman's march
is inherently sort of ridiculous because
well because everyone's for when it's a
very as jordan would say it's a low
resolution argument everyone would say
that you're four women right like no
one's not for women or for women to be
equal not nobody but by and large any
sane member of society is not for women
to be equal in a western society at
least
but when you say you're for women what
you're always going to do is exclude the
minority women so in this case forget
forget skin color even although this is
a this is a minority skin color i
suppose
the women's march organizers they're not
for nikki haley they're not for a strong
conservative woman who happens to have
brown skin but even forgetting her skin
color they're not for sarah huckabee
sanders they're they're not for any
woman that doesn't believe in the
ideology so you're saying you're for
women you mean that women who behave
right that's an interesting retort um i
i think i think i slightly disagree with
with the if you specify
the demographic that you are marching on
behalf then you are
um
necessarily
not including other other people in that
category it happens to be the case uh
well i would say maybe it's de facto and
maybe not intended like the function of
it ultimately i think i think i don't
think there's anything wrong with
with
outlining
like on whose behalf you're marching um
i do take your point that that
but i think that this this has been true
of
women's marches if you will throughout
throughout the like since the suffrage
movement like even within the
the women's suffrage movement there was
there was a lot of
there were a lot of tensions because for
example
um who's the thing who's the most famous
one
uh
susan b yes okay so
there was a dispute between susan b
anthony if i have my facts correct fact
check me on this one there's a dispute
oh don't worry this is this is youtube
they'll fact check it don't worry
there's a dispute between susan b
anthony and another woman whose name of
course i forget at this moment
and the reason was that susan b anthony
was actually willing to hobnob with
people who were racist
in order to
to get the vote passed um and this other
woman who had who was one of the
founders of the suffragist moment had
this falling out with her because she
was like you cannot associate with you
know these people who are trying to to
undermine
another demographic in the country and
so i say all that to say that i think
that there will always be
these tensions within these mass
movements especially if
if you read this article that came out
in terms of magazine especially if
from the
especially if you are
rooted in an intersectionalist framework
i think that that's the issue i think
that you you might be able to see nikki
haley and
some of the other women you mentioned if
it wasn't actually rooted in
intersectionality on the other hand
the women's march is a progressive is a
self-proclaimed progress progressive um
organization progressive movement and so
by virtue of that they're not going to
include republican women right so i
guess that's it
so the name is a bit of a misnomer so
that's what it is i think because i
would argue that being for progressivism
as it stands in 2018 is not being for
women and so i guess it's a little bit
of that that's fair and so i think that
if you were if you were to come across a
progressive march
like a decade ago yeah sure look very
different from how it looks now so
that's actually a perfect segue how is
this all connected to whatever is going
on with feminism right now do you think
do you consider yourself a feminist i
know it's a it's a label that people are
sort of scared of now they either
embrace it and they're not sure why or
they're very scared of it or yeah i
don't really have this like knee-jerk
viscerally like
felt disgust or the term feminism as i
i feel like many people certainly on the
right are increasingly having that that
reaction and i think i understand why
like if you
if third wave feminism is rooted in
intersectionality then like
but like i believe in feminism as a
basic like idea you know um i i love the
i love the work of camille poglia so so
to that extent i'm definitely yeah she's
been fighting this for a long time but i
think like basic if you believe in like
equality for women and basic
egalitarianism to the extent that that
is feminism i'm a feminist i don't i
don't need to
like adopt all the other frameworks that
their way feminism is adopting now to
consider myself feminist
i'd say yeah so let's just back up
slightly to what you were saying about
these competing sort of methods and how
people do things so susan b anthony was
willing to talk to some people yeah this
other woman was and i mean we've seen
this in all sorts of movements martin
luther king yeah behaved a certain way
talked to certain people malcolm x had a
different view of it so you view that as
sort of a necessary
uh sort of push and pull on how a
movement is built well yeah i mean i
think i think that that
whether i believe in it or not that is
what that is how movements are built um
i think especially if you look at the
martin luther king versus malcolm x
dichotomy
it's much more interesting because
i was actually just talking to a friend
about this i don't think people realize
how difficult it was in the 60s to
buy into and practice dr king's
philosophy like we take it for granted
in 2018. even though a lot of people
don't do it now in a weird way right
yes but i think that makes sense because
we're ironically privileged um
i think that makes that's a good
experience that's good um that's a good
title for a book
ironically privileged yeah
um
but people don't realize that these
these guys were training themselves not
to fight back when they were being when
when they were having you know like
condiments
poured on them and diners like that's
hard to to
root your
belief in the idea that i am not going
to fight back because these white people
were made in the image of god
is a profoundly crazy belief and by
crazy i mean like
groundbreaking incredibly difficult to
actually put into practice right noble
beautiful and i saw i so i think that
has to be understood
when we contrast or juxtapose malcolm x
with dr king i think that if you were to
read malcolm x's autobiography um and
what happened to him and and this is
important because people need to
understand why the nation of islam has
assert to a certain extent and to a
certain degree a hold in the black
community the nation of islam at the
time that malcolm x was alive was
literally taking young black men who at
this point for example in harlem were
addicts were junkies and turning them
into
men of upstanding society right and so
in order to
in order to counter the toxic and
deleterious effects of the nation of
islam we have to reckon and we have to
be willing to accept and acknowledge
that fact right the problem is that
that
process of empowerment was also deeply
rooted in a very toxic ideology
namely hating white people and by hating
white people let me be very clear
because i feel like people don't know
the extent to which the nation of islam
is crazy when it comes to this issue
bring it the nation of islam believes
that white people are actually like
like not fully evolved like
that they are actually
um subhuman
and that during the time hey you're
talking to a termite over here
exactly like but like actually and and
that during the time of the i don't know
what would you call it messianic age
that like white people will be destroyed
and people of color will take their
proper place
um in the hierarchy of i don't know the
great circle of life so it's not it's
not some like
it's not just simply
oh you you were very
like people who were white were
historically very
uh harmful toward black people and so
that's why we don't like them no no no
it's an entire way like
like ideology rooted in
um literally thinking why people are
subhuman and it's interesting because
people people will on the one hand
like in the in in on the same at the
same time people will praise malcolm x
and praise the nation of islam
without even recognizing that malcolm x
was killed by the nation of islam
had disavowed the nation of islam by the
time he went to mecca right and came
back
and they're not willing to wrestle with
with the
nuances of of that particular movement
seriously but i say all that but you
recognize the power of that obviously
right the power of sort of just an easy
answer to that just that's what it is
it's easy it's certain right and it's
very difficult for people to live with
uncertainty which i think is something
that
the right needs to recognize and needs
to grapple with when it is rightfully
criticizing things like
intersectionality right there is an
attraction in being certain right
because if you have to deal with
uncertainty if you have to accept
uncertainty as a factor of life
that's very difficult we have like
fight-or-flight brains right we're not
we're not evolved to deal with
uncertainty on some level or to be
comfortable with uncertainty and yet
it's almost the only certainty
right right paradoxically yeah yes yes
but that is that i think also speaks to
why intersectionality is so attractive
because it gives people a way to anchor
their insecurities into something that
is steadfast so when you see people
using some of the language that
the intersectionalists or the woke crew
buy into so for example a couple weeks
ago jemele hill formerly of espn now the
atlantic yeah she tweeted out that
jordan peterson's a white supremacist
and misogynist so you know it gets 20
000 retweets or something right wasn't
he just uh speaking to the seattle
seahawks yeah okay this is what i meant
by the way when i said mainstream like
that's awesome okay it continues yeah
but oh but i'm glad you brought that up
because that was the genesis of the
tweet right because it was the bout that
pete carroll the coach of the seahawks
had let white supremacist and misogynist
jordan peterson talk to the team then
another espn guy picks it up then she
tweets it out so of course i just
invited her i said you know what i'm on
tour with the guy yeah you're welcome
yeah i said you're welcome i didn't even
say you you want to debate him nothing i
just said i would love to have you as a
guest to the show right and of course
she doesn't respond or anything but what
do you make of the fact that they can
lay those claims so easily and they're
rewarded for it so in other words if you
were to do this on the other side if
someone on the right was to say
something like if you call someone
that's not a white supremacist or white
supremacist that's almost as damaging
socially right and and politically and
every other way as possible right right
but if you were someone on the right and
you said something that sounded off
slightly racially
you get called a racist you get fired
and that's it
but
uh jemele hill you know she works it at
uh the atlantic no problem under david
frum who sat in that very chair and and
i think jeffrey goldberg is the other
guy and it's like
you could say whatever you want now
again you know my policy on free speech
so i'm not denying her ability to say it
right i'm just saying that the social
yeah exactly
yeah
um
so what do i make of the social capital
yeah
the way that we can use it depending on
these characteristics so i but i
actually so i get what you're saying i
think i think it's true but only to a
certain extent and i think that the fame
and rise of jordan peterson proves that
it's only true to a certain extent
meaning sure
from a social perspective she has
the
freedom
to
make statements which are not completely
thought out which are pejorative in a
way and disparaging in a way
toward a person
and she can do so
i mean she obviously gets criticism but
she can do so without consequence
basically
on a certain level
but
i would say
that
jordan peterson has a greater reach than
she does
jordan peterson has a greater
um
i would say growing fan base than she
does and so i would question
who has
the more social capital um but it's his
social capital or
it's the capital of of ideas it's the
capital of good ideas sure sort of yeah
but i think that's the same thing i
think that i think that his social
capital um is accruing greater interest
to continue with his metaphor
than hers is and we'll continue can you
do an impression can you do a little
yes yeah yes yes the stocks are
increasing yeah um
and and i think that that will continue
to
play out and i think that that actually
speaks to the fact that the right is
partially wrong when it talks about
at least within the context of jordan
peterson when it talks about the left
social capital because jordan peterson
is
pumping up the seattle seahawks right
that's
i don't think that's i mean i don't know
if he would consider himself to be right
wing but
i don't i don't know if that's happened
on the right in a very long time right i
don't even i've been traveling with the
guy for the last year like 100 shows i
don't even know that he considers
himself part of the right i think he's
vaguely right because he's vaguely
conservative but i would say he's really
an old-school liberal yeah that's been
smacked around by reality but in a way
no he but but in all seriousness he also
transcends these labels and i think that
that's his power and and that's his
social power and i and that's what
that's what i meant when i said earlier
i get what he's doing because
he is distilling things down to their
essence
and
and
regardless of how
uh seemingly compelling the rhetoric of
i don't like this guy jordan peterson so
i'm going to call him a a white
nationalist
goes far on twitter his distillation and
breakdown of ideas and transforming
those ideas into lessons to to live your
life by will almost inevitably always go
go farther
so i would disagree with the premise
yeah all right i'll take that i i like a
little silver lining you know what i
mean like that i i will gladly take that
all right so let's spend a little time
on where you're doing most of your work
now which is advocacy for israel now one
of the things that as a
guy that voted democrat my whole life i
can't really say i'm part of the left
anymore but but a lefty my whole life
until these last couple years i would
say one of the things i'm most
disappointed by the modern left is the
just sort of unabandoned hatred of
israel
this six mile wide absurdly tiny country
with no natural resources um
in in the toughest neighborhood on earth
that's just trying to survive basically
right
but there's but i it makes sense within
the prism of everything else you've said
here related to intersectionality yeah
they sort of don't like success
and jews so they like minorities but
they like minorities when they're
oppressed jews are now thought of as no
longer oppressed so you automatically
put them in the oppressor category right
now you've got a country of these people
that have survived and not only survived
but actually thrived yeah although
there's arab muslim members of the
supreme court and everything else but no
they don't really care about that right
so i don't even know what my question is
other than other than like what is that
because it all in some way it all just
boils down to that they just hate this
tiny little place that dares survive
like i sort of view it that way that's
interesting i think whenever you combine
the
two
processes of
caricaturing things
and i had another one
it's like when you character thing
caricature thing when you turn things
into a caricature
um
and when you
well we'll just go with that if your
fundamental philosophy which and i think
intersectionality is this
esteems caricaturing things
then inevitably
oh this is the other thing caricaturing
and conspiracy theories you put that
together you'll get anti-semitism yeah
and intersectionality i've seen the
memes yes
yes and intersectionality is a bit of a
conspiracy theory
um and it also caricatures people and it
caricatures communities and it
caricatures societies and once you buy
into that
i think that you will see of course
israel as this white colonialist
suppressor and palestinians is this
brown oppressed right which is both a
caricaturing and a conspiracy theorist
and and in conspiracy theories you
caricature people right like that's sort
of the process of how conspiracy
theories work you can't deal with depth
or nuance or complexity and so once this
is your
guy this once this is your blueprint for
understanding society then you will
gravitate toward anti-semitism someone
needs to tell my brown israeli
brother-in-law that he's white right
well this is the great irony when you
don't understand
um
history and and you also see everything
through the prism of your own
misunderstood
um
or your when you understand everything
or you see everything through the prism
of
your very
small american lens meaning these people
grew up in america and they know that
america's
um problems have historically been
between black and white people for
example until they think that everywhere
else in the world all of the conflicts
that are going on are obviously also
something to be divided along those
racial lines yeah it's ironically
jingoistic on some level um or
imperialistic to use there to use their
terms yeah to see everything through the
lens and to the vantage point of your
own reality uh or historical reality
which is what what they're projecting
onto their understanding of israel
israeli society not knowing for example
that as the majority of jews in in
israel are people of color not knowing
just to really get down to details that
likud party which is bibi's party
um rose to power because of its uh
taking on the challenges and the and the
um
and the interests of the miserably
community uh in israel the the jews from
from yeah from north africa right there
there is no like
there is no understanding of this
reality because this reality cannot
possibly exist within an
intersectionalist view of society yeah
so in that way it becomes the perfect
test case right for their
i would say basic struggle for what
reality is in a way or something like
that well struggle for reality inability
again to deal with depth like i think
that that's what this boils down to
ultim ultimately an inability to deal
with nuance and inability to do with
huma to deal with human complexity the
very complexity that they themselves
have and possess
um and that's a skill set to be able to
do that right that's a virtue i think to
be able to do that and so it's not just
the fact that these
to go back to students are promoting
something
which is toxic and bad it's also bad for
them right like they're not going to
have a healthy holistic life if they are
unable to deal with depth and human
complexity do you think it is also
something i'm not totally sure about
this but something to do with just the
geographic size of israel like the
absurdly
tiny nature of the borders that you
could literally drive both ways up north
south east west easily in a day you
could drive all the way north all the
way back i'm sure in one day yeah i
think it's about six hour drive up north
down south this way you could drive like
i don't know 15 times in a day or
something like that but that it's so
small that their focus on that can
become like even more of a laser even
though they make it seem like it's just
this my monstrous ever-growing
um
blob or something like that i mean i
don't know honestly i i i haven't quite
figure out the geographical piece to
this i don't know if it's relevant
in their level of analysis i think right
that's probably it's probably a little
too high level yeah yeah i don't think
that really crosses their mind um i
think that i think just once you see the
world through caricature and once you
see
see yourself as living in this space
where everyone's against you
then it's easy to fall into this trap of
either anti-semitism or being very early
coming very early close to anti-semitism
so what are some of the things that
people say about you as you have fought
this battle because uh you know look i
can look at some of my
some of my other friends and former
guests that
are black that have taken unpopular
positions related to the way black
people are supposed to think which is of
course inherently racist yeah but but
the thing is racial essentialism right
exactly so the things that get said
about larry elder let's say or thomas
seoul for the last 50 years or or my
friend david webb or plenty of other
people um
i know you get a certain percentage of
that because when i was doing a little
googling yeah people people say not nice
things about it yeah i mean it could be
that i just turned off my twitter
mentions and so i don't oh
you figured out the meaning of life
so i don't really like come into contact
with i mean honestly
i
if it is happening i i think i have a
filter and it is happening right but i
think i have a filter i have filters put
into place and turned on that
limit my seeing them
i i hate to sound like callous but i
just don't care
meaning
i think
i think that and it used to bother me
like in college
like someone was very pejorative toward
me someone was very racist toward me
because of my my like calling me like
a slave and all these various things
um and there have been other like i had
a death threat i suspect this was a
tolerant lefty saying that because of
your views right you know what i don't
want to caricature dave according to but
i'm talking about this specific person i
might think i'm right sure yes i'm just
saying i don't want to caricature the
left as this sort of like
i know that was just a pretty that was
that's what we call an educated guess
fair yes he himself particularly yeah
happened to belong to yes um
but
but what was i going to say oh i had a
death threat also in college which was
it wasn't funny but i don't know it's
kind of funny
that someone would take such time to
like focus his energy on me
um which is a little weird but beside
that
um i i just spend my time and my energy
just trying to put out good things into
the world and i think that because i
focus on that more than what the haters
to the speaker saying i just don't
notice them anymore and i'm just trying
to get put good energy out into the
world to that end you wrote your first
piece in the new york times uh how long
ago about five six months ago something
like that yes about that something like
that yeah i think in july or something
why i refuse is it why i refuse to hate
white people why i want to get this
right i'm sorry why i refuse to avoid
white people why do you remember because
yeah
i'm pretty sure you're supposed to
remember the title to your first new
york title okay all right they get the
title yeah well what do you make of that
title then let's let's start that
because a lot of people don't know that
that often you can write an op-ed for
for a major paper and that you don't
pick the title because often people
don't get past the title right right i
mean i didn't have a problem with it i
think it was true to the essence of what
i was saying so what was happening that
i suspect it has a lot to do with
everything we've talked about here but
what was going on that you thought that
you had to write this i mean this should
be pretty obvious stuff right i think
there were actual pieces in the new york
times where other people if
people of color were saying like i'm not
gonna have my child speak to white
people and i was like what there was one
i mean you're not making this up there
was one just a little bit before that
that literally was saying yeah i
literally said that and i think that i
was also
i was also having this
intellectual
fight within myself against tonight
coates and sort of everything he stands
for and like i have a very strong uh
reaction to that and i think that this
piece was the product of all of those
things in response to all of those
things um
and the gist of it was just that
i
grew up around
all types of people white people black
people muslims asians like i went to a
very egalitarian high school extremely
godzilla and so
um
so the process by which people again
caricature caricature each other and
caricature white people is something
that is a very foreign thing to me like
i don't i can't quite wrap my head
around that sort of language that's used
um
by people who believe in
intersectionality and quite frankly by
people who probably have
good intent like i'm sure the guy who
wrote that piece about
having his child avoid white people was
coming from a place of
a genuine in a sincere place of concern
so i don't want to like
disparage him in any way but i just
don't think you would say his answers
are confused that his intent yeah yeah
exactly um
but
but perhaps i would i would say that his
fear was probably real right and so
um
i think that there's just a better way
and a more healthier way of going about
these things yeah so
what do you think uh martin luther king
would would think about our society
right now there's a good one did you
read my tweet yesterday
i saw your tweet i saw your tweet
tell the good people your tweet
i said i was preparing for taping and i
was doing so by watching dr king's
speeches uh that's so funny well you're
good at your job you know i'm all right
i'm all right well what do you think he
would think of things these days the
state of the way we we talk about race
the people that i think think they're
his natural allies are often using
arguments that are
what i would say or 180 degrees the
reverse of what his arguments were
yeah
dr king
i know this is almost an impossible
question at some level so i mean dr king
wrote a book called strength to love
which is the collection of his sermons
um and i think in one of the first or
second like sermon slash essays he talks
about
like
why he rooted his nonviolent movement in
this
belief in concept of love or gap love
love love
for love's sake essentially
um
and i think that
given the fact that he wrote that he
wrote that i think that he would
definitely eschew this new impulse
within society
to reduce each other to immutable
characteristics i mean this is what he
was fighting against right
but
or i should say and
right he would also have
devised a rhetoric that was strong
enough and compelling enough to
inspire people to aspire to loving each
other and i think that's that's actually
what's missing
um
aside from a few different
commentators here and there who might be
who sort of exist in the i think the
ted talk circuit um
i don't think that there's this movement
within america trying to teach people
how to love and i think that that's
something we've lost
and that was something that was very
central to dr king's writings and dr
king's work again as i said earlier to
devise a blueprint where you say i am
not going to fight back against this
white person not just because
non-violence is a very strategic tactic
but because this man was made in the
image of god
like that is
existential and there is no
profoundly
um existential movement rooted in love
in the same way that it was uh when he
devised it in the 60s
is that partly because we've just made
everything political yes yes uh
yes i mean the
it's become like our identity right
which is by the way why i'm just like
when you say like the left and the right
like i don't know these these categories
have to a certain extent lost meaning
for me and i i say that all the time and
i think you can even when i'm saying
them there's a certain exhaustion with
them because sometimes you just have to
frame we just need words you know it's
funny you said we've sort of lost the
language to talk about some of this
stuff sometimes you just need some
labels
loosely to talk about these things
otherwise the people who
can handle complexity and the people who
cannot
i'll go with that but can you give me
something snappier can we get words to
make that a little snappier can you get
that in one bumper sticker but that yeah
that really is what it is i mean that
also explains the the explosion of these
conversations online right because we're
not getting them through mainstream
media
i would say friends and potential
friends
i told you we were gonna end this with
love
do you have anything else in the love
department yes i think you nailed it
there and then i want to talk about your
website real quick oh i was going to
talk about that but yeah all right so
then let's roll let's roll them together
right into that yeah okay so one of the
reasons why um they're a negative
conversations being had about various
topics various political topics on
college campuses and even in our
political discourse in general
um it's because of the framework in
which that conversation is had
that framework we've talked about is
intersectionality to a certain extent
intersectionality
essentially encourages people to make
assumptions about each other
whether it's assumptions based upon skin
color
based upon financial status or lack
thereof based upon gender etcetera so in
order to challenge the conversation or
change the conversation you have to
challenge the framework and the
framework that challenges
intersectionality
is the theory of enchantment
and somebody here has a website called
theory of enchantment dot com what the
hell is going on over there so a little
bit of context i was at the wall street
journal for a year 2015 i was mentored
by brett stevens and part of my
assignment was to develop a
paper
and in this paper i was essentially
trying to figure out what the psychology
of connection was
why do people gravitate toward what what
they gravitate toward and if i can
figure out the psychology of connection
or the science of connection then can i
use that science of connection to heal
disconnection
and that is what
ended up being the theory of enchantment
and the theory of enchantment um
drives or
depends heavily upon pop culture
studying pop culture because pop culture
shows us what we gravitate toward
so i began to ask myself questions
during the course of writing this
research paper like why do we gravitate
toward companies like nike what is it
what is it you love nike
i love it i love nike but like for some
people nike is a religion like it's like
on that level and like why do we
gravitate towards singer songwriters and
influencers like beyonce and people
would say well it's beyonce it's very
obvious it's beyonce but i'm like no
it's not it's not obvious there's
something happening there
and it turns out that all these
influencers and all these
these companies etc
are doing one simple thing they're
creating content where their audience
sees themselves and their potential
reflected in the content
and that's how they're generating
connections so you wear that nike shoe
because you think to yourself if i wear
this nike shoe i'll be able to just do
it right as the slogan goes
when beyonce says
who run the world girls women see
themselves and their potential reflected
in that song which is why they gravitate
toward her so
how do we use that basic idea
to
bring together people who have been
disconnected
so the theory of enchantment has three
rules three principles
of trying to bring connection in
previously polarized spaces and this can
be used in interpersonal conflict or
conflicts of other nature so the first
rule
is to remember that we are human beings
and not political abstractions
because the first thing that happens in
these spaces we
abstract about each other we think that
we're talking to political objects or
entities and not a full person
and what i will do in a presentation is
that i will point to a pop culture
reference that illustrates this and i
usually point to kendrick lamar because
kendrick lamar has a song called dna and
he says in this song i got power poison
pain and joy inside my dna
and what he's doing when he says that is
he is articulating and illustrating what
it means to be a human being we have all
of these things within us we have the
capacity to do good we have the capacity
to destroy we have the capacity to build
up right
and we have the capacity to tear down
and just as this this impulse exists
within the person what i disagree with
i'm having a problem with it also exists
within me right and realizing this is
sort of the beginning i think for
empathy and mutual understanding so
that's the first rule remember we are
human beings not political abstractions
and as a corollary we will not
dehumanize or stereotype or objectify
any of the human beings or any of the
communities involved in this conflict
whatever that conflict is
the second principle is
if you want to criticize criticize in
order to uplift and empower
never to tear down never to destroy so
if that person who believes in
intersectionality
is
being very mean to me and aggressive to
me
um
i could criticize him by cursing him out
right
and
he can't do that but by you know
speaking down to him or i can criticize
him in a way that makes it very clear
that i actually believe in his potential
i actually believe that he's better than
the content or the rhetoric the empty
rhetoric that he's putting out and by
speaking in the manner that suggests
that i'm more likely to change him so
quick story my angelo told this story
about how she uh she was on set with
tupac at a movie set and tupac was in
the corner somewhere cursing out this
guy uh who he didn't like and they were
like about to get into a fight and then
maya angelou says come here come here
let me talk to you and he's tupac so
he's like all right he's like still
mumbling under his breath
and then she says come over here let me
talk to you and then she tells him don't
you know that we are counting on you
don't you know that you are the next
generation
and that we're looking toward you to
pave the way for us don't you know that
you have been loved and we're looking
toward you as the next as the next
person to uphold us and so the story
goes that in that moment
tupac starts crying
because she had rooted her criticism and
her fundamental belief
in him
you know and then the next day he's like
he's sort of like kind of still being
aggressive toward that guy and then maya
maya passes and he goes he like strains
up he goes good morning miss angela
right so he changes he modifies his
behavior in front of someone because she
believes in him
um so that's the second and then the
third principle the third and final
principle is everything we do we try to
root in love and compassion which sounds
which sounds very like you know fake but
what it means is if someone is being
aggressive towards you or mean towards
you or whatever
you call that out as inappropriate you
say you know i don't know you're from
adam i don't know why you're prejudging
me which is the definition of prejudice
right
but what i'm not going to do is i'm not
going to prejudge you even though you
have prejudged me um instead if you want
let's go to this coffee shop and let's
actually talk about this topic x topic y
whatever we're having a disagreement
over because what's happening in that
moment is they're probably seeing you as
a political abstraction not as a full
human being you have to rehumanize that
space and you and the purpose by the way
is not to get that person to agree with
every single viewpoint you have the per
the purpose of that is to bring back
compassion and empathy even in the midst
of profound disagreement which is
something we we are not doing so well
here
uh in america so that's the theory of
enchantment
this has been a pleasure
can you run for president or something
no absolutely not
that would not work with any of those
three pillars no no it would i just i i
prefer pop culture it's a political
culture yeah that's that's the honest
truth yeah but i appreciate that yeah
yeah all right well i'm so glad we
finally did this and we will do it again
for sure and for more on khloe you can
