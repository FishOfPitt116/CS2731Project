let's uh turn our attention
this is sort of this is stunning to me
uh but
you know i over the years the the crap
that has come out of the texas
um school system
and never ceases to uh shock me
um from the books that they assign and
remember when
when the texas uh
statewide school commission decides on
books it has implications around the
country
not unlike what california does with
cars when california says the cars have
to have a certain
uh standard of emissions it implicates
the entire industry
so too with texas in their school books
and so when they start uh you know
having like pro
um uh creationist stuff in their uh
their school books it hurts everybody
this story
is um amazing um
she teaches she's a speech pathologist
she uh has worked for the last nine
years with the
development of disabled kids with
autistic kids
uh with kids who have um speech
uh impairments uh she's a speech
speech pathologist and um
she was told that she no longer can work
in the school district well let
let's listen to her uh this is a piece
from the intercept it's
stunning i never thought i would be
forefront for an issue or for a cause
i'm not a major activist no i'm not
i'm a busy mom a forecast for me
it was like an opportunity for me to do
something because my kids were watching
me first of all
and i always tell my kids when you see
something wrong you have to fix it
i'm a speech language pathologist i have
been contracting
with the flukeville independence school
district for about
nine years now what was unique about my
position
was that i spoke in arabic so we were
able to
correctly evaluate kids who came in with
arabic
as a language i love my job a lot and
i've always wanted
to be in a job that was in the service
field because i know i'm making a
difference
this year i got a new contract with new
compliances
and i came across one that shocked me
it says in 2017 texas passed a law that
banned state agencies from working with
contractors
that boycott israel
pause it now you probably have heard
about that because of the
tens of videos that dave rubin has done
that all the people in the
intellectually dark web jordan peters uh
jordan peterson this
type of of encroachment
on free speech is right in their belly
belly house so
focus on actual policy stuff well
forgive
us if this is redundant because you've
seen so much
of this from them
she was asked to sign a contract stating
that she does not and will not boycott
israel an economic boycott from a
consumer
the point of boycotting any products
that supports israel is to put pressure
on the israeli government
to change his treatment the inhuman
treatment of the palestinian people
having grown up as a palestinian i know
firsthand
the oppression and the struggle that
palestinians face on a daily basis
you know i have to set an example for my
kids we got to stand up for what's the
justice and for right
and equal opportunity for everybody and
um and humane
conditions and so for me it was an easy
decision in that aspect
um you know i i so i had i could not
sign it
she lost her job um
and can we go to the gofundme page that
dave rubin has set up
to support this mother of two well texas
was uh they're interested in
ideas and she was shutting down their
ideas by not
engaging with their ideas well you say
you're not an activist uh what is that
you're wearing on your head though yeah
exactly
what's your name again uh you say you're
not an activist but then you say you're
palestinian
so i'm getting that out of the conflict
what's this there this is palestinian
olive oil
um jesus i think got along with muslims
and so um he would have had no problem
with them
yeah maybe you could just return the
favor to jesus who was so nice to your
uh ancestors by
just signing the pledge like that yeah
you know maybe the best thing to do
would just be
sign the paper and stop being such a
pain in the ass
because this is totally different than
having an emotional breakdown over
transgender students that you take or
pronouns
and you know i'll tell you what they
would do they would minor thing this is
how they would dodge it if they
ever ever were forced to deal with the
complete
um and it's not even the hypocrisy
because they're lying
they're disingenuous so it's really
a misnomer to say that they're
hypocritical for not supporting her
they're lying in the first instance that
was never part of their agenda
but i'm i i imagine if they were
questioned with this they'd be like well
she shouldn't be caught up because she's
just an individual but you can
discriminate against an institution
which would be a company that is a
contract
i mean there's some some disingenuous bs
i mean the fact of the matter is there's
far more of
this that exists that is a
genuine issue in chilling of free speech
then the issue that ben shapiro can only
uh
give speeches at 95 of the 98 colleges
he's booked at in any given year that
was
uh that was pretty complicated so uh
we'll figure that out but i don't like
that she's calling for killing the jews
anyways ben somebody was mean to you on
twitter
right exactly let's do a live stream
about that for four and a half hours
uh i i think it's also i mean i
i'm i'm at this point i mean i'm i've
always been pretty anti-d platforming
period i just don't i just don't think
it's a smart tactic but it's just
amazing that these people like
in addition to the obvious lies this is
the one area in american life
right now where there is actual
legislation i mean legislation
exists like new in new york that's very
similar to this there's nationalism the
anti-bds
yeah i mean this is and college
professors have
actually lost their jobs
well one cold was kept from an
appointment yes which was huge there was
one guy that was actually fired from
temple they're trying to fire mark
lamont hill as well
and this is an area where you can
and by the way not getting cute like the
people they defend on these platforms
who actually do engage in hate speech
people just calling for civil rights on
a controversial issue sure i'll grant
that
actually are losing material benefits in
the public sphere
not in terms of you know tech uh
platforms and it's yeah i mean this is a
very serious thing
and if you actually do value that stuff
which we actually do
we actually do value free speech yep any
time
barry weiss or one of those uh idw
ghouls
whines about free speech on campus just
please
never let people forget that she got her
start
harassing professors and trying to get
them fired for being critics of israel
it would be nice to have like some video
or something
like that of that
