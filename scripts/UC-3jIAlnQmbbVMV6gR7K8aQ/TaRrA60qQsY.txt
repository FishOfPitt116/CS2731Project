industrially ravaged gowanus canal in
the heartland of america
downtown brooklyn usa
on the program today republicans already
walking away

shutdown
threat and apparently
the wall meanwhile kumar
kamala harris already inching away from
her medicare for
all pledge
u.s intel she chiefs
on a different page than donald trump in
fact they're working
apparently on a different book in a
different bookstore

printing press
in an entirely different language
meanwhile bill barr
confirmation is delayed for now a vote
won't come
before matt whitaker has to testify
in front of the judiciary committee that
makes that
hearing a little more interesting
he looks really relaxed about it totally
uh and congratulations america the ceo
of gofundme says that one-third of all
fundraisers
on his platform are for medical reasons
cool system us has decided to give
venezuela
as uh not president the key to all of
venezuela's bank accounts
trump administration meanwhile locks the
door on asylum seekers
anti-vaxxers fuel a muse a measles
outbreak in
washington state uh and uh
remember that uh wisconsin foxconn deal
well
it's even worse now than it was
yesterday which was worse
than it was when it was signed which was
worse
you get the idea which was worse than
when charlie kirk touted it at politicon
indeed contrary to brazilian law
lula kept from his brother's funeral
as he stays in prison
all this and more on today's majority
report
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
program thank you for joining
us today we have full house everyone is
here
and healthy uh which is shocking to me
uh everyone i know anyone i know as a
kid
their kid has been out sick uh at least
one day over the past two weeks there's
a bug going around yeah it's going
around here
it's all it's it's and with all the cold
coming in gosh i don't know it's a real
it's a real mess folks we got to figure
out what the hell is going on out there
that's what i'm saying the immune
systems it's unbelievable
it's absolutely crazy i heard a lot of
people are switching
because they're getting sick because of
nancy pelosi
um so uh reports out today
that the big border deal
that was supposedly coming has already
uh basically walked it dissipated
um democrats are not
planning on negotiating on behalf of
daca
um daca recipients
basically because they don't trust that
trump
would actually provide a permanent fix
in any way right that he will not
follow through on a deal you know a lot
of times we think of these things that
like well they'll sign it at the same
time and
but we have a lot of instances where for
instance mitch mcconnell has made
certain promises
uh to bring up certain legislation and
whatnot and then it just goes away
uh and it's not a story because nobody's
gonna read a story that oh that didn't
happen period end of story or
people read about it but it's not going
to be on cable news when that stuff
never happens
it's going to be mentioned as an
afterthought
and the democrats simply do not believe
that trump is
a good faith negotiator which i think is
a fairly rational
response and so they won't make this
deal
in the meantime as we know because the
supreme court has not taken up any of
the daca cases
we're in a situation where daca folks
are protected for at least a year
it's still i think a horrible position
to be in
incredibly stressful there still makes
it much harder for
for daca recipients to function um
on a day-to-day basis in our society but
uh
the the imminent threat of deportation
is not there at the moment
uh same two the tps case still tied up
in court
so um i think the the idea for them from
the democratic perspective is
we have some leverage here there's no
reason to trust him to do something that
we don't think he's gonna do
and the fact of the matter is the
republicans got destroyed
on this shutdown they got destroyed
they realized that
they caused a tremendous amount
of suffering frankly in the country
um stress amongst hundreds of thousands
of workers
there are tens of thousands of workers
who are not going to get their
their payback um i think there's an
attempt in the uh
in the in the house to pass a bill so
that contractors
will get uh back pay but when we talk
about contractors in this instance what
we're talking about are
janitors um maybe cafeteria services
at places like um
the you know the the museums
in the uh city or government buildings
in washington d.c
uh those folks folks who really uh
probably need it
as much if not more than any government
uh people uh affected by this
uh at this point will not be getting
back pay that may change
uh so it turns out yeah not just a a
vacation
um and uh i don't know how their bridge
loans worked out
that they were able to secure from their
friendly banker down the street
who they've done all this business with
was so willing to give them money
so at this point trump is going to have
to decide whether
he will declare a national emergency or
not
my guess is they're just going to sort
of like pretend like none of this
happened
because in three weeks there will be
something else that we'll be talking
about that is so
uh unbelievably ridiculous meanwhile
people are starting to dig in
now that we are in a situation where
we just went through the longest
government shutdown we've ever
experienced
where we have some places in national
parks that will
never recover for generations they're
talking about joshua
tree national park where you have
people who are going to feel the impact
of having no money for that month
come in for probably months it'll
probably take a year
for people to sort of recover from that
situation and not have it be
something that they're dealing with
paying off credit card bills
uh worrying about you know dealing with
the
reshaping the things that they had
jiggered around because of anxieties
um government agencies probably won't
recover for another 18 months
in terms of contracts that had to be put
on hold
deadlines that were missed et cetera et
cetera
so now that we've gone through all this
the question becomes as republicans are
now too afraid to engage in it again
rightfully so whether donald trump
will declare a national emergency to
build the wall
people are starting to look into his
claims
of why there needed to be a wall and
i think uh rachel maddow talked about
this first a couple of nights ago
but we have a cnn clip that
basically looks into this movie sicarro
ii i guess it's cario too
and um and sees that a lot of what
donald trump has been saying
about the border seems to have come
directly from this movie
it's a great film let's watch this clip
there are prayer rugs in the film the
president tweeted about prayer rugs
found on the border from a story in the
conservative washington examiner which
quotes an anonymous new mexico rancher
who had
no evidence of the prayer rugs the film
also
features terrorists who take drug
cartels to bring them into the country
and else on the president's mind people
are pouring into our country including
terrorists
we have terrorists we've caught 10
terrorists over the last very short
period of time
10. these are very serious people that
appears to be the president accidentally
or willfully misunderstanding a customs
and border patrol statistic that
10 suspected terrorists on average are
blocked every day
from entering the u.s mostly by flying
at locations worldwide and then
there's duct tape the president has that
on his mind too they nab women they grab
them
they put tape over their mouth they tie
their hands they have tape over their
mouths electrical tape
usually blue tape as they call it 10
times this month
the washington post tying up women
putting tape in their mouth they
tie up women taping them up women are
tied up
they're bound they have women in the
backseat of the cars
with duct tape all over the place the
president claimed women are
duct taped shoved into vehicles driven
across the border and
sold those who work every day trying to
protect
vulnerable immigrants from sexual
exploitation say duct tape
isn't a thing we have a database of 1435
indictments and we went through all the
indictments and we found 26 cases that
involved
kidnapping we did a search on duct tape
and we found
one case of one thousand forty four
hundred thirty five cases that mentioned
duct tape and that case
was an american not a migrant in looking
at all
federal trafficking cases most victims
are u.s citizens only about a third of
trafficking cases
are foreign nationals and the vast
majority of them enter the u.s
with legal visas no duct tape what
donald trump is missing with this sort
of fictional account hollywood version
of human trafficking
is the dire cases that do exist in the
united states including cases of forced
labor and forced prostitution
one other highly dramatic possible
hollywood fascination the president has
those coming across the border have
better cars and equipment
than u.s law enforcement they have the
best vehicles you can buy they have
stronger bigger and faster vehicles than
our police have and then
ice has and then border patrol has it
doesn't exactly
have been the documentary films cnn and
many
news agencies have asked the white house
and let's
i mean this is what i mean what kind of
vehicles are coming in do they think
that they're well did you watch the
documentary
maybe you should do your research before
you snark
now hopefully he will watch that movie
if they can keep him up through it
because there is
i don't want to freak people out with a
spoiler but the enemy might be
within that movie it might be actually
you know
this is like a fake on a fake on a fake
and
um the white house clearly
understood that there was a problem here
and
uh but i suspect what it is is that like
you know stephen miller could be just
sitting there and describing this to the
president as a way of getting on board
this could be like the wall right which
was just a
a way for him to remember to bring up
immigration wall
will always laugh
loudly about immigration something there
was something like that oh no he's gonna
pronounce
it he could wrap his mind around it it's
perfect when did they take 2020 off the
air
so apparently vox
uh saw an email provided to them by the
uh a member with the border patrol which
was sent
as a request for information by the
assistant border patrol
chief on behalf of the office of customs
and border protection commissioner kevin
mclean
uh who is referred to internally as c1
and it asked agents to reply within less
than two hours
they wanted the response within two
hours
and it was the uh the text the email the
subject line was
quick turn around rfi
taped up women smuggled into the u.s
all we require your assistance on a
quick turnaround for
c1 that was the commissioner
not done by ice agents so the
commissioner
commissioner needs this quick please
forward any information that you have
in any format regarding claims that
quote traffickers tie up and silence
women with tape
before legally driving them through the
desert from mexico to the united states
in the backs of cars in windowless vans
which is exactly the language that trump
was using
bonus points if it mentions blue tape
and
reference the news article below for
further info
that news article was a washington post
article
asking where are uh oh
here it is trump's stories of taped up
women smuggled into u.s
are divorced from reality experts say
so they were looking for anything that
would
in any way refute the idea that trump's
um
stories are divorced from reality
and it appears it appears
that he did not uh that that request was
not fulfilled
or i'm sure we would have heard about it
there would have already been a
there would have been a special
announcement from the white house
um blue duct tape and maybe nancy wants
her ms-13 lovers to do that to her but
other americans don't there there's a
story here the same guy
who wrote the speech where he was
quoting bane
from batman at the republican convention
you remember that
it's this is the same stuff something's
going on there somebody's figured out
like we can just tell the old man a
story from the um
from a movie and he'll just buy it he's
not seeing
any movies i can't watch the violent
stuff
i don't watch movies i have too much
work to do it's executive time
from one administration to another or
from one party to another
but we are transferring power from
washington dc
and giving it back to you the people
and we give it back to you
the people
for too long a small group in our
nation's capital
are corrupt has reaped the rewards of
government
wow all right there we go oh my god we
talked with uh leslie lee the third from
struggle session on the anti-fatah this
week
and he noted that part of the reason why
resistance tv
is so bad is nothing could be funnier
than trump is in real life
and i think that's very true it's tough
to parody this stuff

all right let's um just one more thing
about what's happening at the border
donald trump of course i don't know if
he's going to declare a national
emergency to pretend to build a fake
wall
uh but in reality
what uh they have been able to do is to
make life even more miserable
for people whose lives are so miserable
that in some instances
they will walk thousands of miles
to get away from that misery
as you know you cannot apply
for asylum to the united states
from whatever country you are coming
from until you are
on united states territory
you need to have one foot in the united
states
to um to seek asylum
and what happens is
you come across the border you say we
are seeking asylum or i am seeking
asylum maybe you're doing it with your
kids
you get a screening
if you can prove credible fear that if
you go back
to your home country you will be
oppressed in some fashion
you qualify for an actual immigration
court hearing
in those instances under the obama
administration
and now i think uh under the trump to a
certain extent
um you are released under supervision
right you have to check in
with sponsors who are living in the
united states
the if you can't demonstrate credible
fear
you're deported the supreme court
established a um
a measure in which to determine whether
you uh can make a
at least a an initial claim
that you have a credible fear of being
uh persecuted
and that is um that you have a one in
ten chance probability of being
persecuted
that's enough and there's there's
some mechanism in which they determine
you have a 1 in 10 chance
maybe a function of how many people uh
you know
16 year olds are killed or how many
go into jail or but
the threshold is relatively
relatively low for that first process
because
you don't want to send someone back home
to die or to be imprisoned for an
extended period of time
or to be um raped or to be held
uh to be kidnapped
or
etc to be beaten on a daily basis
so that has been the standard for over
30 years
as to that first part of the process
now the trump administration has
essentially
created a new interview
that must take place in mexico
if you're coming in from the southern
border
it employs a much higher standard that
would require an asylum seeker to prove
that it is more likely than not
that they would be persecuted in mexico
uh
in order to to remain in the country
while their case is pending
so they must have a higher standard and
now i don't know what's going to happen
in mexico when all these asylum seekers
are forced to be there they have no
their family is in the united states
that's why they're trying to come to the
united states
it remains to be seen but um
the mexican government has said
repeatedly that it disagrees with the
policy
uh and they argue it's being imposed on
the country by the united states
this is um
it's going to be a problem
it's going to be a problem and
mexico has said they would only admit
central americans between the ages of 18
and 60 as part of the new policy because
a large portion of asylum seekers or
family units are unaccompanied minors
the mexican response could erode the
potential impact of the new policy and
that they will not
allow you know children to come in
but you're going to see a lot more split
up of families in that instance it seems
to me
it's a mess and it's incredibly harsh
and totally unnecessary
but this is what the uh this is what
this administration is about if they
have one agenda
even if it doesn't get you know there's
not a lot of people out there going like
i really want the um
there's no voters i don't know that
there's a lot of voters out there who
have the level of sophistication
in their hatred for immigrants that i
want a policy where asylum seekers are
are sent back for preliminary uh
interviews in mexico i just don't think
there's that's out there but i think
there's the
a concerted effort within the
administration
and this new book uh the author claims
that uh stephen miller has said like i
don't want one
asylum seeker to touch to touch
this country well i mean there are no
i don't think there are many voters but
there are certainly segments of capital
that are happy to benefit from having
immigrants be
as marginalized and criminalized as
possible well
they're not here i mean so it's not just
a question of
capital may have that interest but this
policy doesn't further that
this policy excludes people from out of
the country
but it definitely contributes to the
marginalization of immigrants who are
here
it might it might it might when they're
all gone they won't i mean this
administration
uh you know this is where uh the trump
administration is at loggerheads with
some of that's why the koch brothers
have an issue with it
i mean so i think in general you're
right but i don't think that's what's
animating this
i think what's animating this is
white supremacy white nationalism but
but these people are willing to put up
with it because it also benefits them
i i mean you can argue i don't i haven't
seen evidence of that there are people i
think agitating to get
against the the trump administration
about you know on the right
uh you know the chamber of commerce is
not happy with this maybe they're
pretending about it
but i i agree with you they want
um a significant number of
of undocumented people in this country
so they can exploit them
but this is not the way you would go
about doing it you would let these
people in
and then you can exploit them they're
not supposed to be working you have them
already
uh you can't exploit them if they're not
here
and so um this is just i think
unadulterated white supremacy
um and it's grotesque
but it's what this administration has
been has been pushing
for you know months
um meanwhile yesterday
i don't know if you were listening to
the fun half of the program many of you
were not
i had an extended conversation with mike
from pennsylvania
about kamala harris and um
uh he was saying that he thinks that
kamala harris's
call from medicare for all was
disingenuous
and i said that may be the case but it's
a very hard argument to make at this
point based upon the way that
that she phrased things however an hour
after we said that um this story came
out
and um it's interesting she
she drew apparently record ratings for
cnn
and i want to make that clear that's why
we're talking more about kamala harris
right now
than we are let's say uh beta or
gillibrand i mean
few not as many people have announced
even sharon brown has not officially
announced now elizabeth warren has
we spent some time on with warren and uh
now we're talking about harris and she
is the
right now uh the most prominent
candidate who's declared in terms of the
democrats and in terms of attention
she's getting
and i think um uh you know
understandably
she received
a uh two million viewers on the cnn's uh
town hall which was 75 percent above
cnn's four week average in the 10
o'clock hour
so there's some real excitement and
curiosity around
kamala harris and you know we played
yesterday some clips
that um from that town hall but also
uh about uh that shed some light on her
not just the fact that she was a
prosecutor i know there are some people
who think that
all prosecutors are uh inherently
um just it's disqualifying i've said in
the past that you know if elliot spitzer
uh turned out not to have a pathology i
think he would have been
a great candidate there's a guy who went
after uh bankers and financial criminals
um with uh uh you know
an in a pretty big intensity and so you
know only a prosecutor is going to be
able to do that
um it's not so much that for me that she
was a prosecutor
i i you know the one the one
election i cared about in the primary
last year more than any
was i wanted zephyr teachout to be the
chief prosecutor of new york state
um the issue is not that she was a
prosecutor
but you can see numerous instances
of her disdain for
any type of criminal justice reform and
you can see her bragging
about policies that are incredibly
punitive
to um to people
living in poverty to people who have
been marginalized people of color
and um it's going to be interesting to
see
we said at the time yesterday if
um we're going to see any pushback from
like uh black lives matter's folks or uh
you know folks who have been working in
the space of criminal justice reform
and there's some indication that we are
seeing some of that
uh do we have we have heard her tweet do
we have that tweet
i put it in sound polls um um
it's kianga oh yeah taylor who is
we've had her on once or twice you've
probably had her on too on tv for a
while yeah
and um it's gonna be interesting to see
if this becomes more of an issue for
uh kamala harris she writes
uh kyanka yamada taylor says
using the stick a threat of imprisonment
to get poor black people to fall in line
if you excuse this
away by claiming this is what she had to
do to be electable you're telling
yourself
not all of us see black people as
expendable the eggs you break to make an
omelet
so this is uh kamala harris's comments
of using the stick to make poor
poor families behave yeah that's the
video that we had played yesterday or
two days ago
when she was talking about um
using the stick to get um
people to to make sure that their kids
were not playing hooky
and that a stick of course being you
know um
and and you know this problematic stuff
that
i don't think the
majority of democrats necessarily
care about um however
if more people
like yamada taylor start speaking up who
are engaged in this
as an issue and begin
to say like hey this is very problematic
because
this is what her background is
she doesn't have another decade of being
a
state lawmaker or a federal lawmaker
this has been her career
and if her if if if the fundamental
perspective she had on this
was that um there was
a a moral
problem with some of these people who
needed to be disciplined
uh in some fashion
this could grow into a problem and you
know
um the argument that uh mike from pa was
making yesterday was that she's
she has no you know real
depth in terms of her relationship to
medicare for all and my argument was
well she signed on to bernie's proposal
almost immediately as a co-sponsor
and it is true that she's also
co-sponsored
two or three other medicare
for all light proposals yeah she's
hedging her bets
well i mean ar
definitely arguably she was co-sponsor
on a bill called medicare
x from michael bennett and tim kaine
which would just add the public option
on the affordable care act exchanges
uh which of course again
it would be helpful but we're talking
about that would impact
at the mo only a 10 million person pool
of people it wouldn't
help anybody outside of the exchanges
with
all the issues that we have with our
health insurance including cost
including um the the pain they asked and
insurances
um brian schatz would create a public
option
uh broadly for everybody outside of the
uh
uh to do a buy-in to medicaid
but again um i mean i know some people
on medicaid depends on where you live
as we heard uh yesterday uh or two days
ago
but um that's not the same
as having a medicare for all one that is
not a function of the states
but rather uh you know one that the
federal government would administer
so uh but she said very forcefully
two nights ago on a cnn town hall i am
for medicare for all i am for and
bernie's plan calls for the slow phase
out of the private insurance business he
basically said
i think it was like let's move beyond
all that right
with specifically with regards to these
private uh insurers that was her
strongest answer of the night
yes and and understand that this would
phase out and and you would still
i think even under bernie's plan you
wouldn't necessarily have
all of these um there would just be no
private insurance
companies that themselves are in the
insurance business as opposed to maybe
administering
some of the government plans like we
have that relationship with some
uh medicare providers right they pay
through but nevertheless
today there's a story out
that um
she is distancing yourself or not
distancing yourself but
she's put out a uh a statement that
uh one of her you know press people have
that you know she's open to keeping
private insurers now now look
i don't i actually think that it
here's the thing i don't know what this
tells us about what she would do
but it definitely tells us about how
deeply she is committed to
a vision or a policy here
if she had said the other night look
i'm open to getting rid of private
insurers but i think there's some
important reasons why you might want to
keep it
or i mean if there was anything that
implied
she's done some thought about this and
has
a relationship to the policy
because i think there could be arguments
like i say for keeping some
uh private insurance uh as supplemental
i mean certainly done
i mean i think there's arguments i don't
know if i agree with them or not but
there's definitely legitimate arguments
well well
and let's make it clear though bernie's
plan doesn't make
private insurers illegal he just doesn't
want to go through them
to administer a medicare for all system
which is
not the same thing well right and
there's no reason to go through them
unless you want to i know but that's not
my argument
my argument is that when assessing
whether she
feels she has really focused on this
question
as opposed to ticking off a box
these are things that you should have
pretty much worked out so that you don't
have to 24 hours
later walk it back that to me is
suspicious
this is very reminiscent in my mind
of barack obama claiming that on day one
he's going to renegotiate nafta
and then two days after that we hear
reports of austin goolby
going up to uh his uh one of his chief
economic advisors
up in canada being out of the country
this is the way you do it
leaking that you know meeting with the
canadians assuring them that we're not
going to renegotiate nafta
which was a backdoor way of letting
corporations know
letting the interest that the chamber of
commerce know we're not going to
renegotiate right so they're actually
the difference is actually the obama
goolsby move was way more sleazy
uh because it was secret right this just
looks more i mean
secret in quotes i understand but like
yeah but it's more adept let's pretty
much well that was the second thing i
was going to say yeah
sleazy and way more effective for to to
back channel something like that but i
think like
yeah i i've held the position of
particularly on things like medicare for
all where she doesn't have a long track
record one way or another and she signed
on to the bernie bill and
she gave a great answer i was following
the
cnn town hall and tweeting about it and
talking with people in the discord about
it a little bit and i was like
and that was one was i said oh that's
excellent that's a very very strong
answer
um but i mean such a quick reversal
it's a good time to also you know
re-review her donor lists and i think
her
just sort of basic inclinations as well
and i wouldn't have said that uh
yesterday because i think i was i know
you were
possible to make uh but i but conversely
not a bad bet to be wary of her
commitments on policies like that
yeah on the donor tip i mean what this
says to me is that when
the second she gets any pushback from
the business sector
she blinks and that doesn't bode well
for the future and you do need to look
at who's giving her money
isn't the key to the whole problem of
people like their supposedly like their
private insurance
to just to make whatever the government
offers really generous
well it's not that people like their
private insurance
people like their doctors they like
their doctors and they don't want to
have to
to change but i mean that i like listen
the
arguments about the private insurance
or not it's this is a that's distinct
from this
this is really more about assessing how
deeply she has
considered this like i say had she come
out
and said at the cnn thing exactly what
her press release said the next day
when she was backing off of what she had
said the night before
i would be a lot less critical of that
because
maybe i would disagree with the policy
but it's clear that there's been
some sitting down and wrestling with the
issue
and that's actually what i thought had
happened but in the reverse i thought it
was like
she's clearly basically running a
centrist campaign and it's 1992
middle-class tax cuts and you know
and then medicare for all is the bridge
to the left yeah because that answer was
so clear and so unequivocal i was like
oh
this is going to be the one and maybe
also just potentially the new mainstream
of the democratic party
like you're going to be a real outlier
if you're not supporting this so i was
also
i mean yeah that's i think the way we're
narrowing it i mean obviously it's
troubling in and of itself because it's
the right policy and the policy we need
but it's also
um it's a mishap for a campaign that's
actually had like a really smooth
rollout so that's also
troubling she did throw in the word
access though which should always make
you suspicious when anyone says that in
reference to health care it is a total
dog whistle
yeah i i that's true too we um
the the i think it was we got into like
a twitter fight with andy slavitt about
that and there was polling that
suggested
people like that word and that's
that's what i think he responded to
right um
but uh that it that's why you hear that
word and it's a
it's a it's a meaningless word uh but
you know this is
this is why when um
we get to the debates or we get to a
a sort of a narrower race or where
things become a little bit more pointed
these type of things are going to come
to the fore
and um you know
again it's only worth
so so much if you'll recall
in 2008
it was barack obama who's championing
the
the the public option but saying the
mandate wasn't necessary
and it was hillary clinton saying that
the mandate was necessary that was their
big uh
issue the the over the mandate but um
i don't know so uh just a uh revisit on
the kamala harris thing i imagine
there'll be more
uh coming in in the future um
meanwhile it it really does feel
like uh the trump administration
is really trying to
uh set the table for some type of
either direct or sponsored military
action
in venezuela um
you heard the other day what uh you know
hopefully you listened on thursday
last thursday uh michael gave sort of
the
broad outlines what's happening in
venezuela
um
the uh and i've actually been reading
just a little bit
of some uh some legal
thinkers stuff about uh people who were
supportive
of the of the use of that constitutional
amendment in venezuela
um but feel that uh gwado i can't
pronounce it quite
quite guido um
went a step too far it's one thing to
use that uh
constitutional amendment as a way of
saying we need to start a process to
find a new president
uh it's another to simply say like oh
and i found one it's me
um and
it also feels like uh the us
is a little bit rusty at this doesn't it
does it i think i mean i want to be
really clear that the u.s
uh has definitely been you know uh the
2009 coup and honduras
was backed by the us what we've done in
law fair in brazil so we've been all
over this
but this specific version of like 1980s
like kind of like
let's have the military depose somebody
and set up death squads it does seem
like they're a little bit rusty well
they tried it in venezuela
in 2002 right with hugo chavez but they
failed
yeah but it was a half-hearted thing
there's
the pattern in venezuela that also is
similar to now though 2002 there was way
more grassroots support for
chavez but it's just that the opposition
hypes the republican administration bush
now trump and it's like
we got we got this
the the administration is just showing
their cards
now those they're trying to intimidate
the military into defecting i think
they're really trying to say like look
guys
this isn't just like we're gonna back a
couple of oligarchs
and you can still keep your patronage
networks with a new government which is
obviously the case
this is like 50 this is like put up a
picture of him with his
uh of all right so here's one of the
ways arrogant oh it's a miscalculation
because again i think i think you're
right though the venezuelan military
whatever else you say about i think
there is a healthy normal human response
of like
you don't get to dictate who my
government is by threatening me
and it's also i think one that has a
certain sophistication
as to like you know how supported this
administration is
so uh bolton gets up there with a piece
of paper
that has one thing written on it and has
somebody
uh like done a zero in it supposedly
says like what
5 000 troops uh to to colombia
this is like written like 5 000
u.s troops to colombia now look they're
there
um the the
the idea that he is uh that's the way
that they plan
their their awards is just one line on a
yellow piece of paper
that's clearly a a means of which
to i don't think this is for domestic um
uh consumption i think it's for
consumption
from you know within uh in in venezuela
this idea that like we could be
um we could be uh you know
providing material military support
for some type of invasion and
look it's possible he didn't realize
what he was doing
but i can tell you that i did this with
charlie kirker on
his on the debate i went out there
after seeing jake talk to him about his
um
you know i went out there and i wrote
like 50 i can't remember what it was but
the 503c
filings you know and uh for
um and wrote that on the outside of my
notebook it kept flashing it at him
during the debate i mean this is not
sophisticated psyops here folks
and i imagine um you know
the the venezuelan military probably has
a little bit more sophistication than i
do
when it comes to what you know what's
actually going on you know that i don't
think they're both trained by the same
people that's right
that's right um so here is john bolton
on uh with uh trish reagan
and i'll tell you something
um i'll make this announcement right now
if this new catchphrase of this
administration catches on
i may have to go away in some fashion
i'm not sure exactly how if it'll
involve medication or what or just
like uh go to your happy place and put
myself in a rocket and i'm going to go
to the caribbean
islands but it'll be deposed by the
united states for like another 10 years
but if
but if i see anybody on the mainstream
media
say the words troika of tyranny
in a uh any other way other than quoting
what bolton says
i honestly i don't know what i'm going
to do with myself
we want everybody to know we're looking
at all this very seriously we don't want
any american businesses or investors
caught by surprise they can see what
president trump did
yesterday we're following through on it
so if you think of a company like sitco
which is owned by petavesa
which is the state-run oil company there
in venezuela
we have a lot of those cisco sicko
assets right here in the u.s
is that something for example sir that
you're looking at yeah well we're in
conversation with
major american companies now that are
either in venezuela or in the case of
citgo here in the united states
uh i think we're trying to get to the
same end result here you know
venezuela is one of the three countries
i call the troika of tyranny it'll make
a big difference to the united states
economically if we could have american
oil companies really
invest in and produce the oil
capabilities in
venezuela it'd be good for the people of
venezuela it'd be good for the people of
the united states we both have a lot at
stake here
making this come out the right way well
now aside from the
troika of tyranny and of course troika
of tyranny
in the um in its original translation
means
they have our oil under their ground
and um
you know i mean i'll use that phrase
united states colombia
and brazil are forming a troika of
tyranny
that are trying to foment a disastrous
coup
and and you know they're already you've
got to appreciate the fact that bolton's
out there
being very explicit yeah right like it
does feel new to me
correct me if i'm wrong but they didn't
used to just go on the news
say it out loud but we're doing this for
oil money bolton
said publicly and granted it was before
his u.n ambassador i mean
he said like you could blow off how many
stories the u.s building would make no
difference
yeah no uh no bolton has has been
probably threatening people yeah
bolton's an edge lord bolton's been
publicly threatening people
for ages um and so uh
i i this could be there you know setting
up the american public for this
but i also think it could be they don't
feel like they need to set up the
american public for this
i think they also feel like they can
just do it you don't need to set people
up for bringing them together
it's through you would say we'll all
come together in a grand
cou it's it's so trumpy like remember
when trump was like
yeah it's bad what they did to jamal
khashoggi but like we have a lot of
economic interests with saudi arabia so
one guy's life a lot of oil it's not
even close
um the uh
the only the sort of the the positive
news and we're seeing this maybe in the
context of yemen
um rokahana is uh has reintroduced
a war powers resolution or is about to
uh to end our involvement in the
yemen civil war um
and here he is on democracy now
uh i think it was yesterday or the day
before um
talking about uh just broadly speaking
uh the failures of u.s intervention and
regime change
and criticizing that i mean for all of
our legitimate concerns about
russian interference in our elections
where we get concerned
if a journalist appears on russian
television and a member of congress
talks to them imagine if someone were
calling
the opposition in our country we would
be
furious justifiably furious and so
it makes no sense that our vice
president would be calling
and interfering in politics in venezuela
what we ought to be doing is working
through international institutions and
laws calling for
uh human rights but not getting involved
in a potential
civil war and again this is no defense
of maduro everyone recognizes
that there have been extra official
killings there
that his economic policies have led to
hyperinflation
but the reality is that when we have
intervened in places like syria
in places like libya what has the the
consequence has been
that things have gotten worse and for
some reason the people who have led
all these interventions uh are still uh
able to dictate american foreign policy
it's almost as if
failure is the qualification to be part
of dictating what we should be doing in
venezuela
and that's uh you know in addition to
him being
absolutely right about the repeated
failures
uh of our intervention even ones that
if there have been any that were done
with the best of intentions
our record of success is extremely low
um did pretty good in world war
ii to a certain extent obviously
but uh when we get into when we're
talking about
non-world war situations
things have not worked out so well
um particularly when we're talking about
uh
intra country conflicts
and so um but he also i think does a
good job there of explaining like
this is how you can be critical of
a leader and there are mechanisms in
which we have
to uh hopefully impact um
and push other leaders to be better
or to be gone in some fashions or to
strengthen the ability of people to make
to have some form of self-determination
but it has to stop
when it becomes some form of
intervention
well and again i mean the alternative
to this coup and this right-wing force
that people like mexico are putting
countries like mexico are putting
forward is diplomacy and
also i have to say i mean i'll get to
this more
tomorrow potentially but bernie sanders
you know like a lot of people were
annoyed about his tweets because
uh you know he opposed the intervention
but still was quite critical of maduro
and i
i had some annoyance with that too but
speaking uh i've you know i know someone
who's
who's in contact with people in the
foreign ministry
of the bolivarian government and they
were like
those tweets were great like they're not
expecting
bernie sanders to come out and go like
and nicholas motoro
should get a medal like the people who
are still sincere
inside that government which i think
there's definitely a lot of people that
are
and that government has achieved some
amazing things and obviously also had
failings
they're not blind to the problems and
things that need to be changed either in
fact is usually the case they're the
ones that are the most
sincere about making those changes right
yeah i mean if
if a president bernie really wanted to
undo the damage
back to zero that the u.s has done to
that country and other countries in
latin america they'd be paying
reparations
for all of the sanctions that they've
imposed on these governments in order to
make them fail
and or the death squads that they've
unleashed yeah
they could un-kill some of the people
there too

[Music]
we are back
sam cedar on the majority report let's
go
right to the phones where are we here
go to a uh 610
610 where are you calling from who's
this
hello hello hi
um this is sophia i'm calling from new
york i'm not
mike from pa even though i have his area
code
um i'm calling because
oh sorry go ahead i'm calling because
you brought up something that i'm
interested in the other day you took
your kids to the brooklyn museum and you
were
talking about um not wanting to go into
the
sackler wing for feminist art because of
the um
complicity that the sacklers have had in
the opioid crisis
yeah and um it's something that i've
been following
i know it's not something you cover
generally because it's not like an
art podcast but um it's something that
i've been following pretty closely
because
there's an artist i'm really interested
in named nan golden
she's a pretty famous photographer and
she's founded this activist group
she yeah i should say i think we played
the video of i mean i'm familiar with
her work
a few artists i probably am familiar
with uh on some level but
okay she was big in the the 90s i think
that's probably why
uh when i was engaged in in the culture
around me
they're still teaching her you know
in photography courses in colleges she
um
the sacklers gave a big amount of money
for a wing at the natural uh history
museum
where they brought in basically um
big egyptian artifacts and re-uh
constructed a um like a almost an
egyptian temple i guess
and she left that
i guess it was the met yeah because they
had that on that big protest
right now i'm sorry yes i threw all the
pill bottles into the atrium
i'm thinking of is where the yes where
the
egyptian exhibit is i'm sorry i have the
natural history museum in my mind but uh
that was at the met
and she had yeah uh led a big protest
there it's the only
kind and i always remember of that when
i'm in that situation
yeah well it's um it's not the only
protest she's held she did one at the
sackler
um i don't know if it's an entire museum
or if it's just a wing at the harvard
art museum
uh she's you know she's been doing it at
the smithsonian because there's the free
sackler gallery
down in d.c um and
so i've been kind of following like the
lawsuits and the
legal developments around um basically
trying to hold this backwards
accountable
um you i've read a couple of um
op-eds that are very angry that
elizabeth sackler who
you know founded the um oh sorry i tried
to walk into the hallway so that there
wouldn't be noise but there's people
here
um i i was
reading these outfits about elizabeth
sackler and how
she and her father didn't actually ever
make money off of the sale
of oxycontin um because her father
arthur sackler
his brothers like bought out his share
of purdue farmland
like the 80s and oxycontin didn't hit
the market until 1995
so it's kind of like this whole thing
where they're trying to
where they want you to feel like you
don't have to feel guilty
going to the elizabeth sackler center
for feminist art because um
because she didn't benefit her money's
not from
oxycontin her money's from like the sale
of
valium in the 60s which was also very
aggressively marketed right
so you know that's much better but um i
guess
the reason i'm calling in and wanted to
talk about this a little bit is that
because i feel like when we
like the met is saying it's reviewing
its um
its policies for accepting funds and
they're going to be more
more like of sticklers about where the
money's coming from
but um but i wonder if
we had a different
setup like maybe what the
european union has uh if we would even
need like
all these philanthropists supporting
arts institutions
because we were watching you know you
said that clip from davos and it's
like like stop talking about
philanthropy
start talking about taxes uh
like in france um which obviously has
some of the most
beautiful museums in the world and most
well-funded museums in the world they
don't
have the same tradition of philanthropy
that we have
um because you know the state
like takes care of its institutions and
they actually really take a lot of pride
in
like their culture and stuff and in a
way that you know the united states just
doesn't it's all about like big patrons
here and um
and like making your patrons feel good
and feel represented by um well that's
the extortion too
right you've got to let us be
billionaires otherwise you don't get
things like
art or um or museums
or um you know uh
classical musical halls or stuff like
that that's the
that's the extortion yes right i
remember once i
when i was in college i did this
interview to try to get a scholarship to
study abroad there were like these two
rich
patrons um who were you know
interviewing people to decide whether
they were worth some money to send them
uh abroad and we i didn't get the
scholarship because i got into an
argument with them
over um this museum called the barnes
foundation in philadelphia
um that's where i went to school and
the barnes foundation used to be in this
like mansion
in a suburb called lower marion and it
was super inaccessible it's like a
it's a like world-class collection that
has all these priceless
impressionist pieces that like it's if
you've ever go which i highly recommend
you'll
it's it's wonderful but um they
were holding it in this mansion in the
suburbs that
like no one could get to because it
wasn't accessible by
public transportation this guy died in
like i think the 40s or the 50s the guy
who collected all the artwork
and he stipulated and his will that like
yes this will be a museum but you can't
move the collection it has to be
in this mansion and there was a big um
to do about moving they've moved the
collection into
uh center city philadelphia so that it's
actually accessible to people
and there was a big to-do about like not
not meeting the stipulations left by the
donor this guy that's been dead for like
60 years and like had no idea
what the future would look like and and
i got into an argument with
the um people who were giving the
scholarship because they're very wealthy
and they were saying you know it's
really important to respect the patrons
wishes
like because otherwise other
billionaires
might not want to you know donate
their collections and they might just
keep them if you don't you know keep the
billionaires well that was always been
wondering like what happened
first off uh sophia good job for you uh
way too uh way to uh work that interview
uh well i didn't get to go to england so
whatever
sorry to hear that but it made for a
good end what would happen
yeah what would happen to that like
those pieces like okay fine we can't
move it
we'll just let them just rot away in the
collection we'll make it even more
excessive can i
can i just say that because i feel like
we're having a nice little art couple of
minutes here and unfortunately
if people are following this and they
have more recent piece but this is as of
november 19 2018 there's a
local union uh 30 members were
protesting
around uh moma i believe
so there's a lot of um or moma ps1 in
long island city
so there's also a lot of uh union work
around
uh the staff at these places as well and
it's just yeah i mean it's
that's really messed up just even just
the idea that there is like this big
disconnect between
like that art is like a leisure activity
and a when something of the whims of the
upper class is terrible
oh yeah art has been totally ruined by
capitalism
totally like why should art be like used
for
rich people to park their capital in why
art should be for everyone like i'm also
thinking about um
remember when the brooklyn museum hired
the head
of the african art department and it was
a white woman
and then like i started to look further
into it and like
most major museums do not have
a single black person working in their
african art
departments curating art like what the
hell
well yeah since i've been graduating
from college and i'm not like going to
art museums
constantly for like class requirements
and stuff
i've definitely started the questions
and their relevance just
i mean not in general like obviously i
think art is important and people should
be able to see it but um
like the way that institutions are set
up i
have interviewed for a lot of like arts
to positions and when i go and interview
uh for like these level entry-level
positions it's like
the hierarchy is like there's like some
wealthy white women at the top
who um you know work from home like
three days a week and then they'll come
into the office
like two days a week to um dole out
uh jobs for the all the like entry level
it's like all these
again like young women working in the
arts who are making like money yeah
so you all kind of give up eventually
and move on to something
uh more lucrative but well that's what
uh
the guys that uh gee de board was
running with uh back in the late 60s in
france they had a couple of things to
say about that
i think they were actually stabbed some
art uh at the time
but uh sophia i appreciate the call
thank you um it kind of reminds me of
this tweet from our friend uh
jonathan chait the other day about the
journalism and the media where he was
like
hey uh i think he got most of the way
there he's like i think it's clear
at this point in time that the market is
not going to support
the amount of journalism that a healthy
democracy needs
if it's done on a for-profit basis so i
think
rich people philanthropists should step
in right like if it's a public good
it's almost like it should be publicly
funded
it's nuts or at the very least what you
need to do is
you don't you know there's another way
of doing it where you don't have to
it gets sticky right to fund um
journalism as the government uh on some
level
but there's another way that you can
subsidize it without getting it caught
up in the stickiness of having the
government fund
journalism that is fund a lot of the
expenses
that the journalists have so that uh
that you fund for uh all professions and
therefore
the sort of the uh the amount of revenue
that needs to be
uh kicked off by these things gets
diminished
um universal programs indeed um
all right this is fun to watch look it's
pretty rare
i get to watch somebody who i really
loathe
uh talk about somebody else who i loathe
no not this guy who i loathe
the other guy um this is chris christie
who apparently uh i didn't realize this
but is still alive um and
still gets invited back onto television
shows um
i don't know what he's doing is he
working at a law firm doing some lobbing
or something probably right
but this is how you know
that chris christie has given up on
his dream to be
donald trump's manservant i give you
chris christie
uh with is it margaret hoover on
well look how we've fallen firing line i
want to talk about jared kushner because
frankly
it comes down that he's the one who
fired you
right that's what steve bannon told me
yes and you believe that sure right you
believe that because there's history
between the two of you
between me and his father not between me
and him but you can understand why he
takes it personally
yes and no would you separate your
experience if your father had been put
in jail from the prosecutor who put him
in jail if my father was guilty i would
mr kushner pled guilty he admitted the
crimes
and so what am i supposed to do as a
prosecutor i mean if a guy hires a
prostitute
to seduce his brother-in-law and
videotapes it and then sends the
videotape to his sister
to attempt to intimidate her from
testifying before a grand jury
do i really need any more justification
than that i mean it's one of the most
loathsome disgusting crimes that i
prosecuted when i was u.s attorney
and i was used to attorney new jersey
margaret so we had some loads of
disgusting crime going on there
there you go i enjoyed that clip for a
number of reasons
i mean tell me the lie uh the
the best part is just how much glee
chris christie is getting
in repeating that i'd be totally happy
to refresh everybody's memory on just
how
utterly despicable the kushner family
funny you say that because i have a
computer here with a whole um
keynote address with the uh graphics of
the powerpoint
yeah yeah that's enjoyable but it's an
indication
i don't think chris christie does that
even six months ago no it's over uh
it is uh that ship has said trump got
cucked on the shutdown and he wants to
take a little tour
back on tv i think so remember it was
jared kushner who thought like
we're really going to be able to i i've
marshaled in this whole criminal justice
reform
didn't like so classic
did not understand that this thing was
already basically done
right they brought him a baked cake and
he thought he made it from scratch
this is going to be just like this
palestinian
exactly but it wouldn't work out that
way i have an idea
i'm going to hire a hooker and give it
to my sister's husband
and then she'll get the tape and then
they'll give me the money
how does that i don't understand how
that intimidates her from
i mean i don't know well because she'll
see the tape and she'll feel very upset
and then i'll get the money but wait
but if the wife sees the tape she's not
gonna go in and testify what
against whom well i think uh no i think
she wanted to
obviously drive a wedge between the wife
and the dude i see yeah that was the
play
okay she'll see the other woman and then
she'll go to pilates even more
and then she'll be distracted and then
i'll get the money
hold on one second i have a call on the
other like no we're not turning the heat
on
uh meanwhile speaking of um a laugh riot
here's dave rubin this i'll tell you
what's interesting about this uh tweet
which is willie
i don't follow dave rubin's tweets that
often
well that's not true either but um this
one was actually
somewhat interesting to me um let's go
can you play the original video that
he's reacting to
somebody uh the susan b anthony list are
they the uh um
anti-abortion who's who's
but here it is a state delegate
um yes working to save babies okay so
let's play the video
the um the
the fact of the matter is is that third
trimester abortions
virtually every single one of them
is a medical necessity that
uh there is some measure of danger
to uh the mother or
we're talking about um fetuses that will
not survive
more than a couple of days if that
outside the womb because they
they uh some people born without
a spine competition would start kicking
in
here is uh this is i guess coming from
uh
new york i think according to this i'm
not quite sure but let's listen to it
because
the impact it's having on on dave rubin
is both uh stunning and totally
predictable
because this dude has already figured
out what his uh business plan is
delegate tran yes sir how late in a
pregnancy would your bill
apply if a physician
would simply willing to certify that
that the uh
continuation of the pregnancy would
impair the mental health of of the woman
how
how late are we talking about well so so
the way
the suggestion that we've um made in the
bill is
to say it's in the third uh trimester
and at the you know with the
certification of the physician so
so how late in the third trimester would
you be able to to do that
you know and it's very unfortunate that
our physicians uh
witnesses were not able to attend today
to speak specifically no i'm talking
about your bill
how late in the third trimester could a
physician
perform an abortion if he indicated it
would impair the mental health of the
of the woman the mental health or
physical health
okay okay i'm talking about the mental
health so i mean
through the third trimester the third
trimester goes all the way up to 40
weeks
okay but to the end of the third
trimester yep i don't think we have a
limit in the bill
so um
speechless where it's obvious that a
woman is about to give birth
she has physical signs of that she is
about to give a birth
would that still be a point at which she
could request an abortion if she was so
certified
she's dilating oh my god
mr chairman that would be a you know a
decision that the doctor the physician
and the woman i understand that i'm
asking if your bill allows that
my bill would allow that yes all right
so let's just talk about what this
is you need a licensed
physician to make an assessment that a
woman's health
could be mental health could be physical
health but a woman's health
is uh imp is in peril enough
that continuing of the pregnancy
um is
uh wrong or not medically indicated
there is no example of a woman dilating
where a physician has or
would sign off on that there's just
simply no example of it this
is the there's 24 hours
and uh there's a nuclear weapon in the
bottom of
a uh of uh of a well with a uh kidnapped
child
and we've got to torture everybody
because i've seen this on tv
think about it so this is just uh absurd
right this is just absurd
here is dave rubin responding to this
uh a video
with the following this strikes me as
true evil
are any democrats or anyone on the left
pushing back on this
and you know i've noticed he's been
doing this this calculation
lately quite a bit i consider myself
begrudgingly
pro-choice up to 20 weeks
he says what does this mean begrudgingly
pro-choice he knows that it's bad
but he's willing to compromise with some
kinds of babies
but it's getting harder and harder to
even say that now
why would like this is him
working the pivot like i've thought
about how would i
become a conservative as a i have a very
specific guess right
i have i think yes we have contemplation
we've contemplated
i think that this means that whatever
this new patreon system him and peterson
are talking about
mine ends up fusing with uh the new
blaze merger
and that and that glenn beck peterson
ruben fusion could be in the pipeline
here's my prediction ladies and
gentlemen
within six months dave rubin will
call himself begrudgingly pro-life i was
talking with bill
snyder i saw another video
that made me decide that
uh there was a state senator who
presented a bill i didn't like and
therefore women
don't have autonomy over their bodies i
i was
forced into this position did you see
like who
comes up with their their positions on
this based upon that did you see this
in any way anything but disingenuous
sign language interpreter for the city
council in tulsa
that's pretty bad stuff i think i can't
support legal abortions anymore yeah
exactly
he's gonna be he is going to be like
he's going to hire a producer
who's going to be like you've got to get
me the video or the article
that's going to be the one that i pivot
off of being oh he'll retweet those
doctored those
fake planned parenthood videos from like
four years ago they'll be something like
that did they already like
literally have led the criminal
convictions and he'll just retweet them
out like
he had no idea this is really bad didn't
he have a book that he was writing
yeah he was writing a book and he
probably had to re-change he's probably
had to read because he
two years ago he was writing a book and
i couldn't work my way
through the johnston i knew that i
didn't have to do
the book because uh i just
uh realized i could just go to the right
with my podcast two years ago it was
really hard because it was like i
haven't read a whole book on ideas and
freedom and then all the sudden it's
just like
hey i'm gay but i support fascists all
of it just came along
i remember the day i realized that i
could support
total intellectual freedom and be
against the woman's sovereignty of her
own body
and that was the day i realized i can
quadruple my revenue
uh year over year uh if i can just
invite on oh a couple more people to the
right yeah i live in
i live in this stuff i think about ideas
all the time
one of the ideas i encountered that
really disturbed me this clip of an
assistant
toll meter uh made in milwaukee
saying that uh mothers should be able to
actually kill their kids six months
after births are any democrats going to
speak out in this
i did a classic 80 20 analysis
of uh what i was doing and decided i'm
not going to be pro-choice anymore
it's weird ideas because like
when he says it's getting harder and
harder to even say abortion is okay at
all
what's happening in his brain like is he
going through a religious conversion
that's like
he's healed coming on like yeah it's as
if like
like this does not implicate abortions
up to 20 weeks
at all at all
sjws are pushing it too far and causing
a backlash like all the idw people said
if you want to look at it in terms of
archetypes this is a
classic captivity narrative he's uh he's
pulling off here
when he started his uh hustle he was uh
you know cause i mean one is like he
obviously has this very malleable
personality
uh because you know he just sort of
right defers to everybody
anybody he's primarily talking to i
don't want to give i don't want to
credit him with too much
thought behind all of this but it's like
in the beginning it was all it was sam
harris and atheism but now it's like you
know their ben shapiro was around and
jordan peterson's around and
a little bit he did the stuff with glenn
beck a while ago so you know there's
another marketplace there and there's
any new things to consider i look if you
and look
raccoons are considered very smart for
animals
like they but if you watch a raccoon and
i have i've actually spent a lot of time
i know you've made us watch but if you
watch a raccoon looking for food
they cover everywhere and then when they
find the food
they just keep going back to that place
and they keep going after it so it's not
like they look at structures and say
there's food there it's just that they
comb everywhere and then they find and i
feel like that's what he's doing
it's just like i'm going to cross the
the entire
plateau the whole all i'm going to cover
every inch of this planes
and wherever i start to find something
that will you know
nourish me i'm talking about cash i'm
going to just
keep hovering around that area and
that's what it feels like i found that
talking about late term abortion was
very nourishing
yeah i would not degrade uh the good
name of raccoons by comparing them to
dave rubin
i think they are noble creatures they
are clearly some kind of antifa
anarchist with those little masks on and
uh i think slovo shishak might be one
so much smarter than david much smarter
and much nicer
didn't leave government to do that also
i would encourage everyone to read
jezebel's interview with a woman who had
an abortion at 32 weeks
because it's a really tough situation to
be in
anyone who has a late-term abortion like
that
has a wanted pregnancy that has gone
wrong
and the amount of unnecessary cruelty
that these laws inflict on people who
are already going
through a heartbreaking situation is
despicable horrific
horrific um
let's go to the ims no thanks tulsi uh
hi guys pretty disgusted by jimmy dore's
comment about not caring about india you
can't be a leftist without wanting
leftism to be international i feel that
jimmy and tucker belong on a spectrum i
don't think jimmy is racist
but i can imagine people watching both
programs and belonging uh
on the extreme right wing love the show
left his best
so apparently a lot of people because i
you know we obviously covered this
uh and i covered this on tmbs because i
find particularly that type of sentiment
to just be
really disgusting and i agree completely
with the i am
but i guess in the nature because
because you guys uh you covered
yesterday that uh that apparently rogan
realized later that the thing was a hoax
yeah
so apparently at the end of the podcast
uh you know jimmy said that that was
wrong thing to say
so i don't think it's exculpatory in my
opinion from the analysis
but you know whatever i'll i'll put that
i'm trying to be more uh christ
well i mean that would say so it's like
what does that mean though it's a wrong
thing to say
like he he was like the wrong sentiment
i don't know people are reporting it to
me i
look i'm just right putting him out but
i mean i don't know if he me
i get what you're saying i don't think
he meant like i probably shouldn't have
said that strategically
i think it was a little bit more like
yeah it didn't sound right yeah he meant
i i'm just doing what about it i didn't
mean to imply that i don't care about
india
i mean to be doing what about it but
which is also really bad
and his what about ism he acts like are
we we're in bed with israel too well
it's like tulsi is not great on that
either so yeah
i mean actually that would be an
interesting like if you if you actually
put me in a room and you said
like support between like allegiance to
like uh modi or netanyahu that would
actually be a
very interesting debate and you could
make a pretty compelling
case that the person connected to india
would be less damaging because
any challenge that just that sort of
infrastructure in the middle east would
be worthwhile but
yeah i mean whatever i'm just trying to
the same way tulsi gabbard who obviously
i'm
very much not interested in as a
presidential candidate
she's tweeted some good stuff about
venezuela so i'm going to give you know
props for props or do
jonathan armstead uh thanks for showing
the clip of kamala talking about poverty
and billionaires yesterday
i hope as this goes on she becomes less
awkward when answering questions like
this of all the dems who've announced so
far who do you think will speak the most
about poverty
i back john edwards over obama and the
oa primary because
how good he was on it he was very good
on it uh that's
actually where i was more of an edwards
guy um
didn't work out let's go to the top
johnny boy
i mean poverty poverty uh poverty i mean
part of the problem with edwards is that
he also had that problem
of like you were in the senate and you
didn't do anything about this stuff
at all and then you started now when he
left the senate edwards
um he went on a big initiative that was
and he was very actually also if i
remember correctly
he was going out and marching with the
unions i mean and
i remember distinctly having a
conversation at the time he was doing
this when there was no
with no indication he was going to run
for office
with uh my producer at the time we were
both like this guy
talk about pandering but if this is the
kind of pandering he's doing great
can i also say i don't even know what
he's been up to the last couple of years
but i mean
i think he's a little overly demonized
maybe that's an unpopular take but
i just think like in a world where like
newt gingrich
is like sought after i think it's more
just the close call aspect of it no i
mean
look whatever i'm not saying it was good
i'm just saying like i don't know that
it was like stuff that meant that
well i yeah like television again or
talking about national politics again um
well he also you know that would have
been a big problem
if he had been the nominee and i think
that was
right um you know
we didn't need another round of that
remember you're only eight years out you
had uh
bush and you had bush because a lot of
people felt because of bill clinton's
actions
so uh but not so to
to answer the question like everybody's
gonna talk a lot about poverty
um talking about inequality is a little
bit different
and i think the person who's gonna talk
the most about inequality judging from
past experiences bernie sanders i'm
gonna go out and come in there
guessed that you were gonna say that of
those announced
because bernie isn't technically
announced yet though i think that's
happening very soon uh
elizabeth warren but i actually don't i
think
inequality she's talking about and i
think inequality obviously bernie will
talk about
poverty actually as a specific category
i don't hear from really anyone
no except for occasionally bernie yeah
there's lower in the ceiling and race
if sheridan gets in there yeah i could
see sharon brown talk about it more um
and i wouldn't be surprised to see
uh julian castro uh do that that's true
because
yeah that is you know sort of i i i
that that is i would imagine that's that
there's more than talking about it
though we should look at what they're
proposing to do about
it and when you go up there and say like
knowledge
is the currency of the future like
school is the answer to poverty like
don't listen to them well i i of course
i think uh
you know he's coming from hud right yeah
yeah so he
he i i he's probably uh well suited to
talk about i think the uh the person i
think the
literally there is only one argument for
julian castro's candidacy and that is
could you imagine the emotional state of
donald trump if a mexican cuck
defeats him that's it jaby when i heard
kamala hara speak about displaying the
badge of her office and throwing poor
people in jail i heard a bully this is
especially bad
uh when you know that she showed extreme
deference in not prosecuting bank one
and mnuchin
when thousands of charges she could have
pursued i'm afraid this is how she would
govern as president
uh karen sullivan county sorry
if you heard this one why doesn't the
cia ever engineer a coup
in the u.s because there's no u.s
embassy here 1963. adam kochhead
hey man uh it's going to be 70 in
chicago tomorrow
minus 70 and they will have five buses
grabbing homeless people as mobile
warming stations this is our future it's
happened faster than scientists thought
there should be riots in the streets
uh kill capitalism please have matt
brunig on the show he's got some great
critiques
of mmt and some good ideas on capitalism
socialism people's index fund elizabeth
warren and many other topics please
i've have we not had him on this show
he's definitely been on the show maybe
not been on both yeah i've done ring of
fire with him
multiple times i don't i can't remember
have him on him
he knows his good ideas ramsay he's good
ideas hey sam
just wanted to point out the contractors
and certain secretaries of government
are responsible for a lot more than
supplemental services like janitorial
and food i work for a small sub agency
in the national weather service that
deploys and monitors weather buoys all
over the world as software developer
literally every employee in this agency
from developers to
engineers and scientists is a contractor
uh the only
feds are management and administration
max in phoenix watched
devil we know documentary yesterday if i
was ever asked uh
how health care would be paid for i
would say dupont dupont will pay for it
and 3m and any of the companies that
created health problems in the first
place
the devil we know is about that case we
spoke uh
to pap about i've talked about it quite
a bit on dupont and
c8 uh glass seagull question for
medicare for all is there a mechanism
to ensure that employers pass on their
health care savings
to employees the
there i don't think there is a mechanism
but i would imagine
what that is is that um there's gonna be
competition would kick in for those
employees on some level i mean
they're uh you know if if
uh if gm is
uh relieved of health care uh costs
um they're competing for workers with
ford
um i think look there is a very strong
argument
that um single payer
you're still going to have um issues
without a robust
antitrust regime
whether it's you know because you you
have still a single-payer system
now a medicare theoretically will uh
will
uh impose cost controls but um
antitrust has got to be a big part of i
think of
of of any attempts to
make sure that uh wealth is
redistributed
you need taxation and you need uh a a
broad-based universal
uh set of social insurance and health
ideas you need to
make sure that there is genuine
competition
um in you know
in terms of of hiring in that respect um
i believe the other mechanism is called
a union
you can form a union and make your boss
give you
the savings from not paying for health
care
it's great just do it absolutely and i
think
um the more you have an anti-trust
regime that
inhibits the power of corporations the
more likely you're going to have
um you know uh uh easier
time unionizing oh yeah like if we had a
president
who was like a real pro-union sock dem
they could absolutely clear the way for
a mass wave of unionization on the part
of workers
uh kreitz i've suggested a guest who you
may have interviewed before she's a tort
lawyer who held a gun manufacturer to
account for selling a dangerously faulty
riflescope her name is gina romano
i feel like i have uh turnip vega sam
what's a
persuasive rebuttal to people who say uh
uh
uh one or ten percent already pay their
fair share of taxes
because they pay for the majority of
income tax revenue
um what is the
uh persuasive rebuttal well they pay
more in actual dollars than other people
but it is uh commensurate with
how much benefit they have gotten from
uh
society in the structure of society i
mean look
the um the
the fact is they won the lottery
and that lottery was set up because
society people pay
in taxes to structure society a certain
way
and that ended up benefiting them an
inordinate amount and
uh disproportionate relative to their
fellow citizens
so they have a disproportionate
responsibility
of putting back into the system that's
all and don't forget
capital gains are taxed at a much lower
rate than
actual wage labor and that's how most of
the ruling class makes most of their
money
they sit on their butts people work for
them
or their pre-existing capital works for
them
and they pocket the difference between
you know the value created and what they
pay the people so really
uh it's not a fair system to begin with
and they should be paying
way more they're lucky that they even
have this position in the first place
i think that like it's um
it's not even a question i mean on some
level i think like
getting into questions of fairness and
not fairness i think
you know is i think that makes for good
political rhetoric
but the bottom line is is that it is
destabilizing for society
these people have benefited incredibly
from society their trucks go on the
roads a lot more
than my trucks do and um
they they are obligated to pay because
society
is going to decide ultimately that um
to have this type of wealth inequality
is just not healthy
and um
but you can hit it i guess it's just a
function of who's listening to as to
you know which one of those is going to
be more they're not mutually exclusive
either
apostatic apathetic steamroller the
troika of tyranny doesn't sound that
good how about the terrible trio
or maybe a devil's triangle winnipeg
craig i'm getting concerned about how
many online self-described leftists are
talking about warren
i know it's not fully representative but
it's still alarming how many of them
think she's some sort of
establishment tool or corporate shill
and who say it's bernie or nothing and
that tulsi is the well you're in the
you're hanging out in the wrong
circles winnipeg craig uh i'll tell you
that right now i've seen people be a
little bit
meaner to warren than i think is
warranted
online i've seen her get called a
neo-liberal which feels a little unfair
that's the you know what what annoys me
about that is is
two things i mean one is actually i
should say three things one
in a lot of ways she's a good candidate
she deserves props
two though like when you start to use
neoliberalism like that
you give idiots like jonathan chait
who've tried to delegitimize the use of
that word a lot of ammunition
and three yeah i think that there are
actually
really valid important critiques of
elizabeth warren which you
undermine by being an idiot about it
like i don't know it's just it's just
such a bad idea on so many levels
all right let's go uh we got some pretty
good well let's listen to um
uh elizabeth warren is um with a good
idea
she's uh talking to her um on her wealth
tax and
who she's talking to is she's talking to
um uh o'donnell right
and um here she is explaining uh the
wealth tax there has been some
skepticism as to uh folks ability
to uh capture uh um
uh wealth tax because apparently wealthy
people will will hide it
but um we have that same problem with
income tax too
frankly let me do it yeah there's
there there's places you can see the
cash you can get some of it
and um it's also i think just like
i think as important as the revenue
as important as diminishing the wealth
that these people have
is i mean it is important i think i
think is like
having uh such wealth inequality not
just income inequality but wealth
inequality
is also destabilizing and um
unhealthy for a society
it's also signifying to uh the society a
certain set of values and it's
reinforcing that notion
that to have a healthy and successful
society you need to have one that is
more egalitarian
um here is elizabeth warren
on that proposed wealth tax so here's
what we know
projected this year is the tippy top
the one-tenth of one percent
will pay in total taxes that they pay
about 3.2 percent of their total wealth
that's the whole thing all in
the 99 percent will pay more than double
that
about 7.2 of their total wealth
so part of what this is about is just to
say
the playing field looks like this could
we just make it look a little bit more
like this could we just level the
playing field
a little bit and then here's the key
part
this would produce revenue about two and
three quarters
trillion dollars over the next 10 years
how about we invest that
in child care so that hard-working
families get some relief
how about we invest that in reducing the
student loan
debt burden so young people who are
trying to get a start in life who
who want to do startups and want to try
to buy homes and can't do it
because of student loans get some relief
how about we invest that
in a green new deal to help protect this
planet how about we invested in the
things that help us
build a future that's good for our
economy
and that's what the wealth tax is all
about
so uh the pitch is you know uh one part
we need to um we need to have less
wealth inequality
and uh two-part and look at all the good
stuff we'll get for it
i think uh and yeah i mean that's great
that's a good policy idea she's
definitely the best candidate
in the race so far in my estimation i i
think like
maybe it's just a stylistic preference
but i do i do think there is something
in the moment now of the of when someone
like bernie also
turns the heat on a little bit and
doesn't just like which is interesting
because she
she does that really well in hearings
with bankers she eviscerates them
and i think she could bring that in tv
appearances a little bit more
but even just like the one we played a
couple of weeks ago where bernie was
talking about a worker's wages in iowa
he had a specific example of a woman who
had like
been working barely above minimum wage
for like 10 years and he's just like
that's and the crowd just
erupted right because it
is it's disgusting and that's the only
thing
i mean it's stylistic but i think it it
matters
i would like to see and i know she has
it because she does an amazing job in
those hearings when she actually does it
to bankers personally which
should be all of her campaign ads should
just be montages
of her like great performances and those
hearings yeah people are pissed off man
and she needs to be channeling that if
she wants to win
and like people's i think people's
reactions to
her especially like the the vibe she had
in that last clip
are gonna be very heavily dependent on
whether or not they liked the teacher
that she most reminds them of
i i'm actually kind of okay with her
stylistic like i mean the tippy top
stuff
if her policy was a bit more bold like i
think you can raise more than
two percent two three percent go to five
and then
but you use that same thing as you
you're just talking about the tippy top
and then you seem more reasonable let
bernie do the more like
bomb throwing stuff but i you know i
don't know
two to five percent that's not from a
rhetorical standpoint i think
what's more interesting to me is on the
get side
i mean uh you know so like uh focus on
on on the material benefits that are
gonna come from it
two five percent of the wealth whatever
it doesn't matter
rhetorically it doesn't matter but five
percent would be a big number yeah
that's actually a very
big pruning i forget bruning uh crunched
those number differences those are
actually significant
well maybe she's an incrementalist and
we'll make it to five percent
all right let's uh go uh oh i want to
play this too this is
pretty funny now as you know um
people have been just so mean
to um to uh
this guy schultz what's his name howard
schultz
people have been so mean to howard
schultz um no there's a lot to learn
i think even about how we conduct
ourselves sound honestly folks
look it's
there was a time in this country where
you could respectfully sit down with a
billionaire
and they would hear you out if you had
some complaints about
the impact of the way
they have constructed their wealth
and uh maybe they take a bus
um back when i was a kid i remember if
there was a
local billionaire you could go down and
just ring the doorbell
and fifth avenue was like a listening
post sometimes they would
send down their their butler uh or their
chauffeur and they'd come down the
bentley and they'd pick you up at the
gate and drive you back up and you'd
have some tea and sit down and talk but
no more
we get stuff like this that uh fox and
friends are
pretty upset about you egotistical
billionaire go back to getting rationed
on twitter
go back to davos with the other
billionaire elite
[Music]
and then he was escorted out so
billionaire's a bad word now
can't make money whatever happened to
putting up your hand
and saying my point is you know uh
howard schultz
congratulations on the success you had
and i will read your book
but if you run it'll help donald trump
get elected and you say you're a
democrat when you hurt your cause
that's a conversation what's with the
screaming the anger and being tossed out
can anyone this is democrats yelling at
democrats it goes to show you what a
formidable kennedy he would be but
i don't know what what is like like
there's i have so many mixed emotions
when i see this uh
this clip that i can't one like i do
they really think that
you know our society is now like let
is just so there's protesting like
that's never happened in the united
states like
like that that that is just like way out
of bounds that one guy at a book reading
would
would point out that you're uh you're
you know an elite
but then just this idea that somehow oh
well uh
that this guy yelled at him at a book
reading is proof
positive this is a formidable case
there's a lot of heat on the street
they're getting so desperate out there
that they have to interrupt his book
talk
yeah soros probably paid that guy
there's also the um
i mean if you thought about it for two
seconds
like i feel like that it would it would
be much
if you wanted to help howard schultz and
nothing can help howard chiltz
the only people benefiting from this are
the you know people drifting off his
campaign would
but it would be for them to be like you
know he he's pretending to be a moderate
but he's a left-wing democrat
this guy's so formidable that yesterday
we checked in
on um on his book from the ground up
get it a journey to reimagine he's a
coffee guy from the ground up
a journey to yes nobody got that
nobody got that a journey to a
re-imagining
the promise of america um well he's up
to
24 hole reviews uh ladies and gentlemen
uh he's gotten 24 reviews
and they are two stars uh that he's
gotten
let me just see there's one even that is
um
oh i know what it is uh here it is
the one star review that he got the five
star review he got was
not even out yet i love how people
review a book and rate it one star
because of a person's political
aspirations
aspirations aspirations
i think they they misspelled that were
they making a ted cruz
aspirations isn't that like meaning like
you're gasping or something
uh the book only shifted wrong the only
the book only shipped today
so the reviews are purely political and
natured have nothing to do with the
merits of the book
you're welcome to your opinions but
being narrow-minded and not listening to
what someone has to say
says a lot about where we are as a
country i like paul b's review
uh just titled foh uh please go away is
what the
text says foh means out of here
just to hit sam just if in case foh is
like the song
juicy you need a translation there you
go
meets out of here kelly says of
course mata eb wrote
a great uh review in rolling stone of
the book which uh people can look at as
well yeah
um but you know ladies and gentlemen
i will cop to the fact that we are a
little bit cynical about howard schultz
around here
and uh maybe this syntheticism isn't uh
isn't warranted
um here is stephanie rule
on uh on
uh msnbc she is a former no was a hedge
fund
okay yeah she spent 14 years working in
the finance industry um
she interned for merrell lynch while in
college we all want to be successful
um i mean look she she comes from
finance
that doesn't necessarily there's some
really decent writers and people um
who have a interesting perspective that
come from finance that's not necessarily
disqualifying
but i think sometimes when you're
surrounded by people who have a specific
attitude about anything and it could be
anything
um that sometimes you uh you get a
little bit
um sometimes your thinking gets a little
bit myopic
and uh here is uh jeff stein on
uh msnbc making the case that
we're at least pointing out that
maybe part of the reason what's
animating his problem with the wealth
tax is that he's so wealthy
jeff what do you make of howard schultz
criticizing these tax plans
well if some uh presidential candidate
was proposing a jeff stein tax that went
after my income specifically in that
of eight hundred thousand eight eighty
thousand uh friends in my income group
i think i would also oppose it and
question itself hold on a minute but
hold up
validity isn't it fair to say that
he could criticize it and not think it's
a good plan
far beyond how it's going to affect him
personally
isn't it sort of naive to say well he
wouldn't like it because it wouldn't be
good for him
i mean i don't know if i would call it
hold on a second
he would make a whole lot more money
sitting around as the ceo of
starbucks than he would being president
of the united states
okay that's true i'm not sure how it's
relevant it's relevant
just because he doesn't like the plan
doesn't mean it's because it would hurt
him personally
no i'm not alleging necessarily that
that's why he opposes it but it's at
least worth asking the question and
looking at how would he personally
benefit
from attacks on the rich that would take
up a fair share of his wealth
that seems like a perfectly legitimate
question to ask well now wait a second
um it's it's beyond legitimate uh
because i can explain why someone might
not want to be
ceo of starbucks anymore because you
don't want to work anymore that hard
but what do you say well but being
president would be hard work yes it
would also be the most powerful
uh person arguably in the world uh
most prestigious title on the planet
certainly
um this is gonna be you know once you've
got your billions and you've been a ceo
it's a
you know maybe you want that experience
and
that's a trade-off for money but um i
don't know
if you'll find too many people who go
like the difference between me
um paying uh 500 million dollars or not
paying 500 million dollars
is just simply public policy i'll opt
for the thing where i'm not paying 500
million dollars
but beyond that beyond that
where's the argument that he's made that
this
is bad policy
i mean i've watched all of these
interviews he hasn't made a single
argument that this is bad policy you
could say it's not fair
un-american you could say it's an
american it's un-american multiple times
and it's not gonna happen but this guy
has not made the argument
that it's bad policy he's actually
totally conscious you know
that because if you took literally about
the deficit
then you would do that there is no
argument that it's bad policy
there simply is not there is not
one iota of evidence that anyone
alive or dead could produce
that someone who has multiple billions
of dollars
will be any way less productive
personally or for society if
they uh pay several hundred million
dollars more in taxes
there's just no evidence there's just
nothing
there's you can't even make the argument
theoretically because
these guys have no difference there's no
way for them to contemplate
the difference between having 12 million
billion dollars
or six billion dollars well the the
argument would be
that they would just take their capital
and flee somewhere else where they're
not imposing that many taxes on them but
that's
even not even the argument that he's
making well the i guess the argument
would be
you know what we could also pass a law
that says if you're going to do that
capital flight enjoy yourself you can't
come back to america
yeah simple boom there you go
and then we could see how many people
are willing to leave the country
and uh have their capital leave yeah we
can hide it in offshore accounts
like clearly if we were making laws like
that we would also make a law to
repatriate that money right that's not a
policy argument
the uh the argument that you can't raise
a wealth tax because people will break
the law
is not a policy that would be an awesome
howard schultz press conference so it's
like look
he shouldn't even do it we're just gonna
break the law anyways
right i'm stealing money from the
treasury right now
anyways i'd like to talk about how my
first venti machine taught me about
leadership if i may if anything that's
an argument that the laws are not strict
enough yet and we
need to make more right that's an
argument that we need um
enforcement better enforcement i hate to
do it by your logic though but even on
these really really narrow i mean this
guy
said that the deficit is the biggest
domestic threat we face which is
actually really says something because
he's been saying so much
nonsense that that's escaped notice
that's an incredibly irrational insane
thing to say
by any measure whether you're talking
like mmt
or ecology whatever but
if you took that literally which no one
ever should but these idiots on these tv
shows should because they're always you
know babbling about the deficit even
still they should say
well if that's true shouldn't there be
like a patriot tax to take care of the
death of course
blah blah blah blah right you're saying
that the country's on fire and you're
the only one with a
a huge water tank i mean of course we
wouldn't tax you to give everybody
health care and free college
obviously we wouldn't want that for
general well-being we gotta get the
deficit down to
zero you can do it right yeah there you
go
um this also
uh and this is sort of a a side light a
little bit but
uh of the howard schultz thing but it is
so indicative
uh of what is wrong with our politics
i mean it's funny like you get a guy
like howard schultz who comes in
and he's doing this because our politics
are broken
our politics have broken up people it's
like it's so polarized
and it's bro to the extent that you can
say our politics are broken it is not
because
people disagree all right
that's perfectly uh legitimate and
healthy i mean that's why you
have politics right is to resolve these
disagreements in a way that doesn't end
up with people beating each other up
or shooting each other but to the extent
that our politics are broken
howard schultz it's almost as if he's
doing just like
it's a performance art like i'm not
going to tell you
that our politics are broken i'm going
to show you and one of the ways is
i'm going to the idea that a i can be on
60 minutes the view every cable channel
npr every possible outlet that exists
and why am i on these things talking
about
that i'm actually contemplating i've had
a thought that i'm
thinking about being president that's
one reason why our politics are broken
because someone can
buy themselves into relevance that way
for for for
nothing for having a decent pun
on his book from the ground up what's
going to save them really calling on a
decent pun these days huh well
all puns are bad
uh but bill burton former
um obama official he was like a
communications guy right i think
this is he's basically coming on there
to explain
why our politics are broken now he's not
going to say that this is the subtext of
everything he's saying
because a billionaire came to him
or a billionaire was looking like that
like i i think i'm going to run for
president
who can i talk to who should i talk to
and he talks to some friends and they're
like oh well we have a consultant for
you bill burton he worked for uh
president obama in bill burton's job
when he shows up at that door from the
time that they sat down and had a drink
right whatever it was whatever with the
plaza club
or some or some club or yeah for coffee
they had coffee
uh wherever it was you know at the top
of the the uh
seattle needle or you know like floating
above you know 40 feet on the the sound
of
wherever wherever it was that they met
right for that first meeting
in a spaceship right in a spaceship
where nobody knows where you are like
i'm going to fly you to the um you know
to uh some uh caribbean island or
uh to have a meeting for you know a
lunch meeting
wherever they met bill burton's number
one job when he walked through that door
was
convince this guy that he can do it so
that i can get
paid it's like the animated like looney
tunes literally like the cha-ching
cha-ching hitching
just like the cash he's just like how am
i going to separate this guy
from his money and then one of the and
after the disastrous rollout that bill
burton probably had a hand in
steve schmidt yeah whatever guy taking
advantage of this poor idiot howard
schultz
so not only do we get howard schultz is
on
every television show some dude working
for him
what's my job i am an assistant to the
guy thinking about running for president
he gets on uh meet the press daily
and basically is doing an advertisement
for his
own continued paycheck that's what this
is
president barack obama and now an
adviser to howard schultz mr burton
welcome back to the show sir
thanks chuck good to talk to you well
let me start with
what probably every one of your former
colleagues is asking number one are you
still a democrat and number two why are
you doing this
uh i am a democrat i've been a democrat
my whole life and i'm going to continue
to be one
i'm doing it because i think howard's a
great guy and i think that he
uh he loves his family he loves his
country
he wants to make america a better place
okay
the guys running for president
supposedly are thinking about it
and everyone knows this will throw the
election
uh perhaps to uh to trump maybe
and why is he doing it because he's a
great guy
he loves his family oh and then
somewhere around like oh he's doing it
for america too i forgot about that
he wants to make america a better place
and i think that being with him on this
journey as he figures out whether or not
he ought to run for president
is pretty exciting and i will tell you
that one of the things that's so great
about it
and i've been in politics for a long
time as you can tell from the gray hair
on my head
the thing that's so cool about it is
that it's democrats it's republicans
there's people who are formerly in the
military former journalists
it's a diversity of people that i've
never experienced in politics and for us
to come together and work on this
together has been a really amazing
experience
obviously you know the way twitter works
and social media there's a
certain op-ed you wrote in 2016 for the
sacramento bee that's been making the
rounds let me put up a piece of it
if steiner libertarian candidate gary
johnson eden to clinton's support
even a little that could matter in a
close election and in the same way i
would bet
that ralph nader or at least many of his
supporters wishes that he didn't help to
make george w bush
our 43rd commander-in-chief i suppose
stein supporters would
not want to be in the position of
explaining to their kids how they helped
make
trump president why should you not eat
those words today
couple of things number one uh howard
schultz is not jill stein jill stein was
in that race because she thought that
the two parties were too close together
the two candidates were too close
together
what howard schultz thinks is that the
two the the polar opposites of the
parties are
so far apart but the american people are
close together
and maybe what we need is a choice for
the american people
to choose something different a
different path a a different person oh
my god pause it for a second
that is so beautiful i hope he's making
so much money i gotta say though
a little little message from obama like
more people than you ever met in
politics compared to the 2008
presidential campaign i ran
 you i i just i think
that when that guy came up with that
formulation
that he was so proud of himself honestly
and
like i would be too like i would be like
oh that's a good spin i i i i
mean it's transparent it's obvious does
this this i mean how
how much does this sound that
was somebody closer
it sounds like but it's
actually pretty possible that was the
spin equivalent of
the guy of like oj's lawyers
did create reasonable doubt right like
if you look at that case it's like
he obviously did it but they were able
to create
some measure of reasonable doubt like
but this
that was that was a very this
is like the stuff that it's
like this is why howard's pay well i
think it's it's
it's true i think in a certain limited
sense that i think
jill stein was wrong and saying the
parties were the same i think it's true
that the people are closer
generally than the parties are but the
part the reason the parties are so
polarized is because of oligarchy
right well the other thing is that's not
the question
the premise that he set up in his uh
op-ed had nothing to do with
what their perspective were on the
parties uh
obviously um you know gary johnson and
jill stein
they are not draw a drawing from the
same well necessarily
the whole point was you're siphoning off
votes you're siphoning off votes
from clinton therefore you
are and so it's the exact same situation
whatever howard schultz believes about
where the parties are and where the
american people are and
whatever that that diagram he's drawn
it's not worth doing a segment on but
apparently
uh some some informants have told me
that jill stein will be on fox tonight
to talk about their party rooms
so i i mean you know there is like also
just one line of really dumb thinking in
america that there's something innately
magical about any third party effort
let's listen a different kind of outcome
a different kind of politics in america
and secondly
i just think that he first of all hasn't
made the decision to run
but if he did i i think we can agree
that would it would be a more
serious uh effort than what jill stein
put together
in other words it's going to be even
more assuredly
throw the election to trump it's going
to be even more
like damage there's some debate you
could say
you could say jill stein you know uh
strictly in terms of numbers may have uh
you know had those votes but we can't
say seriously that she
seriously drew support from hillary
clinton
we'll be able to say that this time yeah
he's arguing against his
own points it's ridiculous like it's fun
to watch these people
spin their wheels and make fun of them
but like
if bernie is the nominee there will be a
much more
serious third party spoiler candidate
and
like when that comes along we need to
remember
this person does not get to portray
themselves as a centrist
they do not get to portray themselves as
a moderate um whether they're doing it
for their own personal gift or what
the outcome is that trump will
be president still and that is the
outcome that the ruling class wants
well it's fair enough and we still don't
know how much help jill stein had from
outside actors
given given where she spent december of
2015.
but let me ask you this he obviously
you're using this book tour to launch an
uh an exploratory bid as well as any
book tour launch
schultz ever been to russia that's what
i want to know
god darn it what's going on with the
board i don't know
something's wrong with the the thing
it's an old you have meeting with him
any book tour launch for a presidential
bid
as i've seen in a while so it's clear
you want this to be
the front why what's his
what i'm trying to figure out is i don't
understand why he wants to run
other than he's not them and not them
what is the big idea beyond
not a republican and not a democrat well
the book tour
yeah he wrote the book uh whether he was
going to think about this or not because
he has a story to tell and he wanted
uh to get it out there you know he's a
guy who grew up in the projects
and was self-made he he worked his way
through college he went on to
to build a great company that did the
right thing by the folks who worked for
it
and now he just he wants to continue to
serve in terms of what his big idea
is it's that politics is broken
and maybe we need uh a solution to it
that risks the imagination of a new kind
of possibility
what does he do does this come right the
politics are broken
i'm up here i have uh taken everything
i learned from uh the obama
administration
and i am just selling it out in such a
way to make this guy
a figure who with no agenda other than
the fact that politics are broken and i
sitting here being paid the
tens if not hundreds of thousands of
dollars to make it seem like this guy
actually has a chance to do anything
other than perhaps uh elect donald trump
the it is the ultimate it's just so much
cynicism it's so
layered on top of itself it is like it
is
it literally is like a parfait of
cynicism just
just slightly different gradations of
different product that we can look at
and just it's exquisite and as you can
see there's a huge amount of skepticism
in new and independent media about your
candidacy and you know howard if you
want a little bit of consultation on how
to leverage
and let me just make it communication no
burton's not the guy for you
yeah i'm the guy yeah that well i'm the
guy for you or maybe
is there any more of this well let's
just play a little bit more because he
says
he says the phrase risk the imagination
of a new possibility
he wants to continue to serve in terms
of what his big idea is
it's that coffee politics is broken
and maybe we need uh a solution to it
that risks the imagination of a new kind
of possibility
maybe what has he done pause it find it
now
that needs to be a drop now here's the
thing you could hear
him shuffling papers as he was saying
now maybe that's chuck uh
chuck todd but you he takes a pause
there's no doubt in my mind he's looking
down
go backwards because that's the phrase
that they workshopped and they came up
with that's going to explain
his candidacy it's going to it's it's
his
this is exactly the words i can i will i
will never know so i will make this bet
there is no doubt in my mind that burton
comes in and says
you need your audacity of hope
and here it is he just he wants to
continue to serve
in terms of what his big idea is it's
that
politics is broken and maybe we need a
solution to it
that risks the imagination of a new kind
of possibility
maybe what does he do he risks the
imagination of a new kind of possibility
and this is the way it goes no no in
fact
did not come up with this because it's
too wordy schultz came up with it
and said schultz has been cuz burden
said you need your audacity of hope and
schultz goes i have it
[Laughter]
we need to risk the imagine what is it
risk risk the imagination of a new type
of possibility we need to risk the
imagination of a new type of policy
of a possibility and let me do my
impersonation
of of bill burton when he says that
yeah yeah
say say that one more time to me again
yeah because i just want to make sure i
all right meet the press because that
really
you're really saying something there oh
no definitely no
we that's exactly right you're the new
obama that's exactly it we need to risk
the imagination of a new type of
possibility you're obama
with job experience
oh my gosh you're the obama that did
build that yeah
now i know why starbucks is so huge wow
wow that is really
god i don't understa i mean that's
amazing like because
all these other guys you know but
actually um
who was the other really sleazy obama
guy uh
messina he consulted for the tories so
he's an
ultra sleazy obama guy but yeah but all
the other obama people at least like i
mean they stuck
around the sort of orbit you'd expect
them to stick around
and uh but burton is head of uh i think
it's
sdk knickerbocker of california which is
a
prominent democratic consulting firm so
he's not even like
some of these like grips in the past i
feel like are kind of like consultants
sort of like
past their prime and they're like oh
maybe i can kind of exploit some
right it's not like gullible rich person
but like burton for i mean first of all
he won't help win a presidential race
and he's still in the game so i mean
but anyway he gives you a chance it must
be easy
howard i'd like to talk to you about how
to approach people on patreon
i'd like to talk to you about how to use
uh youtube i think that there's a lot of
people
who would be amenable to a progressive
socialist case for radical debt
uh reduction let's talk about it oh my
god did you see what aoc
uh tweeted backslash about him
she said uh why don't people ever tell
billionaires who want to run for
president that they need to work their
way up or that maybe they should start
with city council first
hmm there you go well because he's uh
he's a
titan of industry but you know here's
the thing
we can sit here we can make fun of
howard schultz we can uh
decry the the the cynicism
involved and those who would um consult
with him and pretend like he
has something to offer america um
but the fact of the matter is is that we
know
these titans of capitalism are letting
us down
i give you laura ingraham and the
ethically and follicly challenged frank
luntz
uh on that very topic who's more
ideologically
unattuned to what their parents and
their grandparents think well that's
because we never had
universities quite this radical or a
media uh
quite this involved in the spreading of
these untruths about the free market et
cetera and we have possibly
she's she's talking about why students
love socialism folks
um we've never had schools that are this
uh radical or a media that's this
this is just unbelievable control f
crippling debt
it's it's but it's just amazing the
level of cynicism because there's no way
she believes this but good
uh quite this uh involved in the
spreading of these untruths about the
free market etc and we have ceos frank
that are running for cover i mean these
ceos who have been doing well in the
trump economy
they better get out there get out from
under their desks and start defending
this way of life in this country or
they're going to find themselves you
know i guess running for the next plane
to the bahamas or somewhere else they
can hide their money
now what i want the bahamas too well
what i found fascinating about this was
like she's talking about um uh you know
the the wonderfulness of capitalism
and then at the same breath basically
making a joke like i also know they all
hide their money from uh
taxes like it's all criminal enterprise
yeah that's part of what's good about it
unbelievable uh i i let's not play this
bloomberg thing right now
oh really you don't want to play me
how it shouts calling we should have
medicare for all and you
pay for it coffee boy calling from an
832
area code who's this where you call him
from folks we have literally 37
people on hold we will not get to about
37 of them
call from an a32 area code who's this
where you come from hi
uh this is chris from austin chris
what's on your mind
hi uh so i'm a person who was born in
venezuela moved to the us
when i was 10 years old and i kind of
wanted to get your opinions
about how the left has been handling
kind of a criticism of what's going on
and i will preface this by saying that
i don't want a us intervention i think
it would be
absolutely terrible and i think people
like john bolton are ghouls
but i've noticed sorry go ahead
uh i've noticed from i mean mostly
internet but like a lot of leftist
conversations like or just unabashedly
just say that the maduro government
is like as good and there's no
kind of critique of the menudo
government is just like
the the picture is that it's the
opposition is only
a psyop from the united states
and that the maduro government is a
wonderful socialist
government that doesn't have
authoritarian meanings
and isn't like quite problematic
like how do you see that
well i mean i think i i i think there's
not um you know a tremendous
amount i i think sometimes these things
get um
get polarized in terms of uh of an
argument about this right where
um i would imagine some people um
genuinely believe that because they just
don't necessarily have
um um
a lot of sense of what's going on there
and i think some people probably
uh do that because it is
um there is a political argument in this
country whether we should be
intervening or not and it is a easier
one to win
by um by simply saying
that this is a uh you know that
that there isn't a problem with the
maduro government and
it becomes easier to win that because
frankly you know that's
within the context of a domestic
argument in this country
it's like should we intervene or not and
um from an academic perspective it may
make a difference
uh as to where you know for uh people in
the united states as to
you know what maduro is about but in
terms of this
uh specific question at this specific
time i think maybe some people
feel that it doesn't i don't know i'm
not sure
to be honest with you like look i i know
i know that there's definitely some
people who
are strong defenders of maduro
and i think even within those defenses
there are really big differences
because like i would consider myself
certainly of the chavez era
a supporter with criticisms and caveats
and then i think under maduro
there's been a real breakdown and then
the other conversation becomes
well what is the dual role between
internal failings
and relentless u.s pressure
and then that also becomes like the
primary responsibility to oppose u.s
interference and then the last thing i'd
say to you and i'm curious what you
think about this
is my read is that all of the opposition
and more and more reporting is coming
out with guido
and right-wing background i mean this is
this is not somebody i trust at all and
i do consider this absolutely
objectively an attempted coup i think
that there
are and i've talked to some people who i
think are are
genuinely like opposed to both sides and
very unhappy with the situation in
venezuela and they say
there is no political path if for us if
you oppose maduro but you recognize the
opposition
is right-wing it is connected to the old
oligarch parties and it is backed by the
united states so i have no doubt that
there's
organic protests and opposition but i
don't think those people
have a base in any of this right now
that's part of the tragedy of the
situation
but first and foremost we just have to
oppose u.s
intervention in venezuela absolutely
and i watched a video uh called a
leftist debunks john oliver's venezuela
episode
the other night on youtube and i think
you should take
everything with a grain of salt that
comes out about this
it's very hard to find totally unbiased
sources
but if you want and i do think it
glosses over uh
some of the missteps of the maduro
government but if you want
an alternate point of view on what
exactly happened there i think it's
pretty good
maybe michael can evaluate it and say
his opinion later i think that's worth
watching
even more worth watching is we're tired
enough with john oliver's crappy foreign
policy commentary which you can find at
the tmbs youtube channel
i will watch that one too
uh but what i would say is i feel like
there's been a characterization
at least from the protests i've seen our
petition protests
like there's been a very clear message
that this is going to be the interim
president and then what we're
really shooting for are
another set of elections that you know
both parties can agree on
but i feel like there isn't legitimate
argument
for why the elections
uh the last elections for maduro were
problematic
and i mean there are political prisoners
they were like important political
figures that could have been an actual
opposing force in the election
that we're not allowed to run to the
extent that i have heard
critique of uh guido's um
gambit is that um is it's around that
um that he's making moves that sound a
lot less interim
than presidente and um that
there's i've like i said earlier you
know i've i've read some
some sort of legal uh uh folks who
uh probably come at this more from a
constitutional perspective in venezuela
who are supportive
of the um
of of was a 233
being invoked but felt that he was
taking steps that went beyond that
beyond setting up a process for a new
presidency and just
assuming it in an inappropriate way but
appreciate the phone call
and maduro has agreed to negotiations
last
uh call of the day calling from
a 908 area code who's this where you
call him from
oh hi is this me yes who's this where
are you coming from oh hi
gotta be quick hi uh this is jay from
new jersey jay from new jersey what's up
i'm surprised i finally got through me
too um
hi um so i was at your uh live show
uh a couple weeks ago well good for you
um yeah really enjoyed it
um thank you the one thing i want to
talk about is um
sorry a second um you you asked a
question
about uh whether the audience would
support
like uh just giving trump the wall
if he uh gave daca or something right
and i voted i'm sorry i'm a little
what you're doing great keep going on
the phone before
um i
i used to work for the federal
government and a lot of people
are really sick of how they're treated
um a lot of presidents
including obama would like reject cola
raises
right these uh yeah um
these shutdowns are happening more
regularly and people in the federal
government
they're paid less than in the private
sector
so these people are really working for
the country
and to be treated like crap by like
trump and
you know a lot of these administrations
it's all very fair
so i think standing up against trump and
these shutdowns
and just saying an example we're not
going to play this game
that's a good thing and that's why i'm
against katie
like in all situations just reopen the
government
and we'll negotiate a budget well that's
what they've done and
that's what they've done and i think
there is something i think there's
something to that and
i think you know uh the the democrats
don't seem to have trusted uh trump
enough to do anything but
and their gambit won and uh so
um the you know hopefully this is not
something that uh
we'll see again from the republicans i
mean hopefully they get stung enough by
this that
we will not see this happen again
appreciate the phone call
thanks for coming to the show all right
i'm going to do three more items and
then gotta get out of here
here we go maybe five more hours dx fool
