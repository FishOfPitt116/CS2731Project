well ted cruz is in peter frase's
terminology he's an eliminationist
candidate um and he's a he really is i
mean
besides his obvious just many you know
disgusting and repulsive
you know grotesque personal qualities he
is
and his politics are right up there with
trump and bolsonaro and everything this
is a
very extreme very dangerous uh pure
authoritarian corporatist and he got
smacked around a little bit
by beto o'rourke let's start with clip
number three
with congressman o'rourke leading the
way two years of a
partisan circus shutting down the
federal government
in a witch-hunt on the president that's
not good for the state of texas it's not
good for our country
uh senator that is your time 90 seconds
response from you mr o'rourke
really interesting to hear you talk
about a partisan circus after your
last six years in in the us senate
that was yes you can definitely see the
tonal contrast there and of course
ted cruz is known for
partisan grandstanding going back to
when he first got into senate he i think
he helped spread a lie that
chuck hagel who's a former republican
senator from nebraska and a realist
uh you know old school establishment
type who was obama's defense secretary
and he had said some mildly critical
things about israel and there was a
rumor
uh a smear a lie about him uh i think
taking a check from a group called
friends of hamas
and uh cruz i believe was part of
spreading that along with uh
that great intellect bench bureau but
now this is where we get
yeah we got to double check that but i'm
pretty sure that's the case
now this is where it gets really good
this is where
uh power twins unite and
you know the thing about donald trump
one of the worst people on the planet as
well
but right of bullying excellent
nicknames
and the thing that he's not i mean his
main talents are inheriting money and
owning republicans
and beta o'rourke jumped off that
and this is what you can expect
over the course of this debate senator
cruz is not going to be honest with you
he's going to
make up positions and votes that i've
never held or have ever taken
he's dishonest that's why the president
called him lying ted
and it's why the nickname stuck because
it's true
yeah you go
suburban dad obama
yeah yeah you go
sensible adidas shoes obama it's awesome
i'm smart enough to know that you own me
but
graceless enough to pretend that i don't
care
and uh here is their final exchange
where o'rourke
um continues on the lying ted theme
speaking of balance and budgets um only
one of us has
with good friends in el paso started a
small business
uh met that payroll every week balanced
the books
made sure that we delivered for our
clients only one of us has served at the
local government level
every single year balancing the budget
seeing each other not as republicans and
democrats
but as council members entrusted with
the fiduciary responsibility to deliver
for the taxpayers of el paso
every single year we did and for senator
cruz to say that this isn't going to
bust the budget at a time of 21 trillion
dollars in debt when we're on track to
deficit spend to the tune
of a trillion dollars a year he voted to
add two
trillion dollars and those tax cuts
disproportionately will flow to
corporations who are already sitting on
record
piles of cash and the already wealthy in
a country that is riven
with income inequality unseen since the
last gilded age why
in the days just before and just after
that vote senator cruz accepted
000 from the political action committees
who represent the corporate interests
that benefited from this tax cut why
does he vote for this why does he vote
for internet companies to sell your
private browsing data to the highest
bidder
without your consent why does he not
vote for universal background checks in
a country that loses
30 000 people to gun violence every year
follow the money in each of these cases
if you look at the political action
committee
contributions to senator cruz it helps
to explain
the reasons for his vote and how
corrupted congress has become i don't
take
pac money not a dime i always have to
represent the people of texas
that's great that's a strong i mean look
and and actually that and it is also
really interesting because as we keep
saying beta o'rourke is no
he's certainly not a socialist and he's
not a liberal i mean he's a centrist
democrat
but first of all and i think
but he's actually more of a genuine
centrist in the sense that
that is where the center of most people
are at
it's not a left position to oppose
selling your private data
information into third parties
and it's obvious that most people want
the sort of background check policies
they pose
pull over 70 percent he's talking about
and don't want to sell the internet to
uh right tech companies i don't want to
sell the internet to tech companies and
don't want to have tax breaks that are
just designed to benefit oligarchs and
corporations so
the way he's branding and being a
centrist is
actually if beto aurora came to
represent centrism we'd have many
battles and disagreements with him but
that would be a
vast improvement for our country's
politics
so yeah i mean god speed and keep
embarrassing
that the that thing yeah yeah
i'm not inspired by pedo o'rourke he is
a status quo
neo-liberal centrist but the republicans
are a
death cult they want to drive us off of
a cliff
so given the choices certainly support
the centrist
absolutely and as i say it's it's i i
if that's centrism versus hillary
clinton that's an upgrade and there's
different yeah they're like
like they're different flavors of
centuries that's another yeah
the centrism we had when uh fdr was in
power is different than even the one we
had when truman was in power and very
different than the one we had when
jfk and nixon and put it in the context
of texas as well
i mean this guy even standing next to
ted cruz you're like and he could have
just
could replace ted cruz he didn't have
the background check thing out too
though
like that's a that's that was surprising
that's sort of messaging i i i'm
surprised
that's i think that's a decision that
he's like this is all about the new
electorate
which is another shift in centrism it's
a conscious pathfinder if you become
like
yeah absolutely is the board uh
i don't know what happened to it but uh
it's somehow it's unplugged what
all right well let's figure that out
before tomorrow so well i won't be here
so if there's like read my board i won't
have to deal with it
nice enjoy yourselves
if you wonder how climate change keeps
getting kicked down down the road
well i mean i'm the nice and chill one
so i would like to get it fixed now but
i don't see any takers to come over and
figure it out
so i guess we'll wait till tomorrow and
then
i'm um
all right i'm afraid i'm gonna make it
worse no that's okay don't
we should not try they should try
