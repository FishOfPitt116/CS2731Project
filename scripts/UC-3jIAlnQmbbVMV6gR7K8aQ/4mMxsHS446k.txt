and lastly donald trump can't even
pollute
competently all this and more
on today's program ladies and gentlemen
uh welcome to the program uh we are all
here today
uh getting ready for uh vacation
uh which is gonna start um it's gonna
start for me a little bit early
uh and then we're all gonna be off um uh
next week
into uh labor day we got to get that
labor day uh
show um pull that baby as well
um and uh as we say the am quickie will
be
around uh all next week while we're gone
so you can get at least the uh you know
a brief
quick news headline we are working on
getting it out earlier
we hear your emails um but uh check it
out whenever you can five minutes you
could literally go to the bathroom
at 9 15 once you get into work just play
it
nobody's gonna five minutes or you have
time to listen to it twice
once when you're really sleepy and then
another time when you wake up more which
is what i did
right all right there you go i'm not
sure i follow that button okay
think about it take it in bro
um so i think we're gonna probably do uh
two days of uh
news stories uh in the uh wind-up going
into vacation
um we're gonna get to these uh recession
fears in a moment i mean the
even more concerning to me is the idea
of a a payroll tax cut
at least the way that i would imagine uh
would be done by donald trump although i
wasn't terribly happy with it when
um barack obama did it as well
but first
donald trump is very upset that no one
has provided him credit
with the criminal justice reform part of
that is probably because
he's an idiot and no one believes that
he had any ideas about this
it just was something that barack obama
hadn't done
so he was okay in signing off on what
people had brought him i mean i think
that's quite clear
we're going to see it when we talk about
these uh cafe standards and the
frustration that he's feeling
that uh he's being outmaneuvered and
trying to pollute
it's a really tough time in america
where a guy can't just pollute
and do it competently i got my best 29
year old in the gym
exactly but here he is donald trump
at the airport he only does um or i
guess he's in morristown new jersey
he only does pressers at the airport i
wonder if that's a way
for people to avoid hearing the
questions
i'm serious about that i think that's
probably what it is on some level
because then
he cannot be accused of not answering
the question or getting or being
it's just a statement that's floating
untethered to any predicate yeah it's
very smart
it's very smart or maybe it's just like
he doesn't it just it gives him a quick
out i don't know but
uh here he is
he might say that donald trump is a poet
and he doesn't
even know it criminal justice reform is
done
beautiful package wonderful they don't
even mention my name
so stupid so stupid thank you thank you
thank you
[Laughter]
wow we gotta play that one more time i
mean you're really gonna appreciate the
you guys need to put some music in the
background that or something
i i i email i i am something that might
work
for a background for this yes
so stupid so stupid so stupid
so stupid thank you thank you the wind
rustles the trees as the plum
okay let's just play it let's play one
more time
so stupid criminal justice reform is
done
beautiful package wonderful they don't
even mention my name
so stupid so stupid thank you thank you
this is a japanese art form
it's like william carlos williams the
moon
pierces the evening sky no credit for me
so unfair so unfair
baby shoes good deal never won
i made deals i made deals
so good for me for me but no credit
no credit thanks dad sad and sad thank
you somewhere
somebody is writing a coffee table book
to sell urban outfitters full of poems
like that
that's true actually but there was a ugh
god i hope not i actually think anybody
who does that really should be
arrested frankly
i think they should be put into the
jimmy fallon gulag
um all right so
here is um speaking of so stupid
so stupid here is uh the five
fox is the five um and
this guy greg gudfield feels like he's
been sort of sidelined during the uh
trump years
because i don't know yeah exactly
there's dumber people there what do you
need the guy for
well what do you need the guy for and i
think he also just sort of realized like
i can sit here and just cash checks i
don't need to go out on a limb for this
guy but
um there's nothing that
gets a conservative even ones who are
never trumpers or maybe
never trumpers or secretly never
trumpers or trump queasy
or just not trump the support there's
nothing that can get
a conservative riled more than the idea
of people just not letting go of this
whole
slavery thing and race stuff
the problem so why are they doing this
is because
i should just say he's of course
referring to the outrageous
outrageous publication
of the 16
19 um
i guess i don't know how to serious
series yeah
it's a multimedia series uh which
basically covers the implications of
slavery and tracks it through
the years obviously uh in terms of the
institutions that slavery built
and the uh the the politics and the
economics
all of which we are of course in some
measure or another living with today
because
of course we are because
it's like we live with the implications
of the railroads
that were built 150 200 years ago i mean
the idea that you could have
such a huge part of your population at
that time
driving the
the economy of the entire country in
many respects
and it not have any implications
on institutions on the way that society
is assembled never mind
the descendants of both the slaves
and the slave owners writing about
slavery in america
there's so much data on this i mean
there's just
but still it's so obnoxious to keep
bringing it up the problem so why are
they doing this
is because racism is a quantity where in
the media the demand
exceeds the supply so they're going to
have to keep creating this
they're going to have to keep doing this
and and to your point that's that slave
story the slave article was probably i
didn't read it but i'm assuming it was
probably well
well researched it was probably well
done but i didn't read it but now
my assumptions are this is all part of a
greater narrative
to paint donald trump is racist so i'm
going to look at everything they do
as somehow uh con artificially
constructed to demonize somebody
and it's not going to stop it's going to
get worse and we have to admit
this country positive for one second i
want you to just
assess what this guy just said
the he starts by saying there is a
demand
to hear about racism that exceeds the
amount of racism that exists and that's
why they've got to go all the way back
to slavery
to find racism to transport it into the
future
in other words they've got to write
about history
it's like doing a remake right exactly
uh
but racism this is a complete denial
of the implications of this structural
racism that of course we know like was
governmentally promoted
well i mean federal government uh you
know uh
through world war ii post in terms of
things like home ownership
but throughout the country by state
governments
well into the 60s that's why you needed
a voting rights act that's why you need
a civil rights act
and never mind the implications in terms
of society and
and what the what what people do
privately in private business and
whatnot but so just that
that premise in and of itself the idea
that like there's a demand to read about
racism but there's no racism
and even if there was no racism
what he considers to be racism
the idea that it has no implications now
is is ridiculous
but then he goes on to say i haven't
read it
i'm sure it's well done but it makes me
feel
like it's an attack on trump
which is basically him saying trump's a
racist
so therefore anything that has to be
written about race even though i haven't
read it i assume is an attack on trump
and because i'm paid professionally and
probably
also feel this way broadly speaking
which is why i got paid ultimately and
found myself in this position
to um to defend
this stuff i've got to now
to paint donald trump is racist so i'm
going to look at everything they do
as somehow uh con artificially
constructed to demonize somebody
and it's not going to stop it's going to
get worse and we have to admit
this country over time gets less racist
do you think we're more racist now than
we were in the 60s or the 50s or the
1860s
it's getting better but they don't like
that story things are going so well
that they need to demonize everybody
pause it
the this is the amazing thing that he's
so clueless about
the reason why we read this in the paper
today
is because it's getting better it is
because
you could not have this analysis
50 or 60 years ago because we were that
racist
like the fact that it's in the paper is
indicative
of the fact that racism to the extent
that racism can get better
but i understand what he's saying that
our society is less
racist but it's still
racist a b even if it wasn't why
wouldn't we want to read about this
i mean as society gets less racist
it gives us the opportunity to actually
deal and digest
with these problems and there are
problems
they were problems at the founding of
our country
and you remember the stat on uh
you can do voting predictions based off
of content oh yes
oh yes oh yes this is from uh from deep
roots
is it from a book that we interviewed uh
uh on the on the pro
you can go back they have gone back and
done a county by county analysis
and they could predict
they can predict voting
and all sorts of different political
applications
based upon the ratio of slaves
to white people in any given county
they can only predict it in terms of how
white people are going to vote
they can't do it in terms of black
people because black people didn't have
any vote or political will throughout
the vast majority of that period of time
and but the fact that we can have these
conversations now that we can have
a newspaper is indicative on some level
of progress that we've made in terms of
race we have obviously
a long long way to go
but gonna go out on a limb and say we
might be backsliding a little
i i i almost think that like it's wrong
even to to look at it as
as backsliding as if we're almost on a
linear path
because i don't think we've ever been on
a linear path and i don't think it
i i think it's it's just a question of
where where it is and how aware we are
at any given point
and
i mean i know what you're saying and i
think maybe it's worse now than it was
ten years ago
maybe but in some ways maybe not
i think maybe this is like it's like
when you're
you know your scab heals over and begins
to itch intensely
you know there are periods of time where
things hurt more or less
but i think that the reason why we have
a donald trump
is because on some level
racism racism had diminished and then it
tightens its grip because it feels like
it's
you know people are losing even more
because
society is becoming in some way some
ways
uh more egalitarian always
does he not want us to mark the 400 year
anniversary of slaves on this
oh oh you're just just doing that it's a
giant subtweet
i don't remember anybody doing this at
the 300th anniversary
like it's 377 or something and they're
really stretching it
i mean but they why did they have to
pick that day couldn't they have picked
a different one to have the anniversary
from
why the 16 19 why couldn't they have
just done it from like
when the first plantation opened
it's very i mean i mean it's very
insulting can you just imagine though
right i mean imagine like how hard it is
to show up at work and
like i've got to come up with an angle
on this i'm not going to read it
i haven't read it i'm going to cop to
not reading it i'm just going to say
like
it makes me feel like it's an attack on
donald trump because they're talking
about slavery
it's not a good look that's wow sad
sad so sad so sad
stupid stupid dude thank you thank you
stupid
folks uh
as you can see you know it's funny last
night i was shaving
i was like we haven't had a harry's ad
in a long time and i'm like well that
makes sense
you know they've been one of our longest
advertisers if not the longest
advertiser we've had
sort of just coffee and um
they don't know that we have a bunch of
new uh listeners
but there it is the next day i show up
clean shaven and i didn't even have any
type of i just
i think that that whole thing grow a
beard got to be yesterday
but as you know a lot of guys buy travel

for me i love the the ergonomic shape of
the handle

bit of a nose issue this summer you can
refresh your wallet oh well of course

trying to
make sure they're being able to put
their best foot forward
um schools come back
breakouts do not have to with america's
number one acne brown brand rather
proactive
has helped fight acne for almost 20
years
um kelly
she doesn't mind me saying uh is a big
uh
proactive or no who was or occasionally
she says
she's been using an on and off from a
high school she says the formula has
improved over the years but the ideas
remain the same it's a great program of
skin care that gives you short and
long-term results
the best acne fighting product that
doesn't require prescription
and it's been that way for a long time
she says i have sensitive skin
proactives program has made my skin
smoother and clearer without causing
redness or peeling
now they've introduced their next
generation acne treatment system called
proactive md
it contains adopuline
which apparently is a uh dermatologist
recommended topical retinoids
email from kelly well no this part is uh
she didn't know about this part
but she's just talking about in general
how well it's worked for her
uh this is for treatment of mild to
moderate acne it's the first
prescription strength
retinoid that is fda approved
and apparently it works by affecting the
growth of cells
and decreasing inflammation
kelly goes on to say it's the perfect
time of the year to start proactive for
many people because school starting up
only takes a few weeks to achieve
notable no
noticeable differences in your skin and
she says
it uh it always helped her confidence
now we have a back to school offer from

all right let's get into um oh i should
also tell you
folks go to our i don't want to play
this now
but uh go to our instagram account
sign up majorityreport.fm on instagram
majorityreport.fm on instagram we'll put
a link in our podcast um
feed you're gonna see
one of it is i would say i don't know
that i've ever seen a video
that mentions the name sam that got the
reaction that this video got
i had i i saw people uh in the feed
like spitting up their coffee people
just writing wtf
uh in fact when dorsey sent it to me
from our instagram account that was my
response was like what the f is this
people are like i thought it was a deep
fake
there's a lot of deep fake apparently a
lot of deep fake paranoia
check it out tomy lauren folks i want to
just dispel the rumors right now
we've never even met but
sometimes wright is right even though
she is associated with these uh
conservatives and
sometimes you just can't help but speak
the truth so check it out on our
instagram account
all right let's get into uh uh the the
recession fears we talked about this
briefly
uh yesterday um
the uh the yield curve is
has gone inverse or was briefly i it
doesn't seem to have uh maintained
um 75 percent of economists surveyed
think that we'll be in a recession by
2021
um i don't know it's a very weird
uh time because in the past generally
the news media
was relentless about denying that we're
in a recession
uh because so much of
the money was being made on the run up
to the stock market
and so many people were making money off
of that every everywhere you turned on
television news it was all stock
rocketed up updates
yeah and it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy too right well
that they think it does but i'm not
convinced that it
that it does but they think it does and
to a certain extent like
the this um uh
the the yield curve being
inverse or inverse yield curve is a
function of
what investors perceive as
what they perceive is things are going
but you know we don't know if they
are just imagining it or they're looking
at signs that tell them
but the white house is looking at
different policies
uh in which to deal with it and
we're in sort of a bad situation
to deal with a recession um
it's so bad that donald trump is even
having to make excuses for his top
economists who he sent out yesterday
you'll recall that we were
observing um we were noticing that there
were certain
characteristics that larry kudlow was
displaying when he was on tv
like optimism optimism
and possibly a stroke
um but i'm not clear what it was
but uh somebody said to uh donald trump
apparently
uh there were reports that maybe larry
kudlow was drunk on tv yesterday
hey sam say do you ever write a piece
called you call it sex in the country
well i i hope not i love larry kudlow i
think he's done a fantastic job
he has been going through health
problems as you know uh but
i watched him this morning he was
terrific i think larry is
a fantastic guy but i haven't heard that
at all
no here we go we're about uh a day or
two away from larry kudlow i think being
oh even not even i like how trump's main
judgment of his performance is how well
he does on the tv shows
it's all about the tv show he's doing
fine i mean aside from the major major
health problems um
so they are contemplating cutting the
the payroll tax
payroll tax as you know funds uh social
security
and uh medicare you pay about i think
it's 6.2 percent
out of your paycheck your employer pays
6.2 percent
uh on the other side uh on top of your
paycheck
and this uh you are subject to the
payroll tax is up to about 132 000
i think it is now aside from the fact
that it really we should have the cap
should be blown out some people call for
a doughnut hole fine whatever
but we're just capturing far less of the
nation's income that way
nevertheless there have been
deliberations in the white house
according to the washington post even
though deliberations about the payroll
tax cut were held monday the white house
released a statement disputing the idea
was actively under consideration
um
business spending apparently in the
economy is pulled back
rv sales are down whatever that means
um well did some people have
everybody has a different thing that
they think uh the you know is an
indication of an economy going south
the last time the payroll tax tax was
cut
was in 2011 and 2012 under the obama
administration
this was uh in the time of a deep deep
recession
that had followed in the wake of the
financial crisis
frankly i was against it then
i'm against it now
the difference i would imagine we don't
know any of the details of how
the trump administration would do it i'm
sure it would be done
in a much more uh problematic way
during 2011 and 2012
the payroll tax was dropped from 6.2
percent to 4.2 percent
the idea was to encourage spending now a
lot of people think it didn't work
because people didn't notice
george bush sent a check to everybody
which probably amounted to less money
but everybody knew it was a check and so
they went out and spent that extra money
as opposed to
doing whatever you know not being aware
that they had the extra money
uh although i haven't seen any any data
on that i just remember
contemporaneously that was something
that people would talk about
the cut when it was imposed
had an automatic sunset provision and by
2013
it was back up to 6.2 percent why is
this important
because the payroll tax funds social
security and medicare
now under the obama administration
because there was so much blowback
from progressives who said you cannot
cut social security tax
because you're going to under fund the
social security trust fund and the
system itself broadly
and this is going to be an excuse to cut
later on so what they did is
they cut the taxes on social security
the payroll
but they made up for that difference in
the general fund and it just got added
to the deficit
um i don't think that donald trump is
going to do it that way
i think mick mulvaney is going to see
this as an opportunity to starve social
security from resources
and which will ultimately be
an argument to cut social security
benefits
this is it's highly problematic it's
also the other problem that we have
is there's no
opportunity to deal with a recession or
let me put it
another way there's a limited
opportunity to deal with a recession
because
the way that you deal with the recession
is to cut interest rates
but at this point our interest rates are
around like what two and a quarter or
something to that effect
i'm not 100 sure but they're low
and when they're low it means that you
don't have room
to lower them there is no magic number
it's all relative on some level
so there's only so much cash you can
inject into the economy through monetary
policy at this point because
we're just not that they're just
interest rates are just not that high to
begin with
the other problem is of course is that
these people are not going to spend
they're going to cut taxes they know
they can't
cut taxes for rich people anymore and we
know
that as as far as tax cuts go
the only ones that are effective are for
middle class people
in terms of juicing the economy and even
then it's not the most efficient way the
most efficient way is to spend
is to actually put money in people's
pockets you could direct where it goes
the problem with the the the trump tax
cuts
not just from a wealth inequality uh
standpoint
not just in terms of a plutonomy and
then a plutocracy standpoint
were that giving money to rich people
does not help the economy
giving money to people living in poverty
giving money to people living paycheck
to paycheck
giving money to people who barely save
any money
that helps the economy because they turn
around and they spend those dollars
but when you give money to rich people
it's not like they have new things to
buy
they just use that money to create more
money
they buy stocks
they they inject capital maybe into some
companies but they're just get they
don't there's no efficiency involved in
that
so there's just not the same
opportunities to deal with the recession
if we do hit one
donald trump is just trying to figure
out a way right now to punt this
into 2021
either he'll be present for a second
term he'll escape
prosecution if he's fortunate he'll die
in office
or it'll be a democrat that takes
takes uh the hit on the economy
and believe me it'll be a disaster the
way they'll go after the democrat
whoever it is it'll be a disaster they
will say you have no money
people in congress in the senate they
will say we have no money to do
these plans we have no money to do this
we have no money to do that
um it's a it's a real concern
but it's a very weird media time too
because i just don't
recall and i've only lived through i
don't know three or four recessions as
an adult maybe
maybe even less i don't recall
this perspective by the media one where
they're not in
full-on denial but
man if bernie or maybe warren isn't
president when the recession hits it's
going to be so much
worse i think it's going to be
i i don't know i mean i think it depends
on what you mean by worse
like they're the only ones who would do
what they need to do
in order to help us out of it the
problem
is yeah i mean the question's gonna be
can they get the senate and the house to
do what needs to be done
there's no president who's gonna be able
to do it alone this
is not and they're going to need the
senate in the house
so i don't know um
the there may be i don't know i could
come up with a like
five different scenarios i don't know if
there's a way to tell
um
i think you just you go with the
president you want to have
and and deal with it but it
you know it's not inconceivable to me
that a uh
a senate would be hostile to bernie
sanders and try and clip them more than
joe biden will come in and be like i'll
give you a
huge tax cut again or whatever it is i
don't know
but it's going to be ugly um and
just in case that there's a desire to
make it even uglier
um the fdic board apparently is voting
this morning and maybe they've already
voted
they're going to roll back part of the
volcker rule
which basically um prohibited
banks largely
from placing their own bets
they could do some things that were sort
of more like uh
best practices certain hedges
certain like uh currency
purchases if it was you know to protect
the assets of the bank
but they no longer were able to
use deposits and to do their own
sort of hedge funds um
and basically just gambling with other
people uh people's money
and now they're going to have basically
more latitude to do that
this is a big problem back in 2008 but
that was so long ago who could remember
who's around to remember such things
um
basically it uses the banks as or i
should say
the depositors as a backstop
will use their money that's in our bank
accounts
not just for loaning out in you know
safe bland vanilla loans but now we'll
also get in there and get go to the
roulette table
it's all fdic insured
so the taxpayers will just have to pay
for it if we blow it
i mean that's basically where we're at
this is a rule that went into effect um
four years ago that's a long time you
get a little bored of those things after
a while
um so that's where we are in terms of
the economy and of course
unleashing the banks right now is a
little bit of a
seems a little bit terrifying and
irresponsible but
it'll be fine everything's gonna be
don't worry about it let's just get the
fed rates down to about
0.25 records all over the place um
meanwhile speaking of the presidential
elections
new polling is out
biden's lead seems to be durable for the
time being
um i think
we will have a much better sense within
two months
i still um stand by my prediction
that he will be uh third in the polls
by uh the end of of uh
october two more debates i think should
be able to do it
people paying attention should be able
to do it
increasingly though i will admit this
i may be wrong about the uh where he is
in the polls
but my concerns about it have increased
when you are in
august the a year and a half out from
the general election
and you are pitching yourself now
granted this is not joe biden pitching
himself this is his wife
who's a politician's wife she is not
she's not freelancing here folks
when you are pitching yourself
as the candidate you may not like but is
probably
the best you've got a problem
like when you are conceding
publicly as a pitch
that many of you do not like the
policies and know that he's not
good on this stuff
you're basically one you're depressing
your own
supporters by by making them wonder like
wait a second
what but you're also basically just
saying
we want the least energized
the least committed
the least enthusiastic base of support
we could possibly muster for this
and that's going to carry us over the
victory over the the
the winning of the finish line we want
idiots that vote
but but she's not even it's evil it's
worse than that
she wants smart people who are willing
to suck it up
and now i understand on some level if
you're saying this as a last-ditch
effort in the general election
i get it but we're in the middle of the
primary and she's having to say this but
you're saying like that's their
base is like people who don't really
like they're not paying attention to
health care as much as
so yes you know i you know your
candidate might be better on
i don't know health care than joe is but
you've gotta look at who's going to win
the solution
and maybe you have to swallow a little
bit and say okay
i sort of personally like so until then
but your bottom line has to be
because i know that not all of you are
committed to my husband
um and i respect that
but i want you to think about
your candidate his or her electability
and who's going to win this race and so
if you're looking at that
you've got to look at the polls and you
know a lot of times i say
oh you know close excuse me polls don't
mean anything calls don't mean anything
but if they're consistent and they're
consistently saying the same thing
i think you can't dismiss that i mean
you all deal with facts
so um i think if your goal
i know my goal is to beat donald trump
we have to have someone
who can be and so if you look at the
polls if you look at
joe with his record with independence we
can't just have democrats
who are going to win you know we have to
include
everybody our party has to be more
pleasing
which means we have to go to
independence and say
join us we have to go to republicans and
say okay
you're a republican but you can't tell
me that your children are proud of the
president
you know of the things he says and and
uh
positive wait a second this part is even
just the most reprehensible
i have two words um
for uh dr biden in terms of this you
can't tell your children
jason chaffetz
it took him about a week and a half to
go from
i can't look my daughter in the eye
after he says i grabbed the
vagina i don't know why i thought that
would be less likely to get
demonetized than um
it's a clinical i can't i can't grab the
woman's private area
is that okay youtube private please keep
giving me no and then a week later a
week later the guy comes back goes up
yeah
it turns out she was cool with that good
children are proud of the president you
know
the things he says and
you know you can't as a mother or as
impossible i mean how can you become
that president as a leader and i think
if you look at where
joe is in the polls in michigan and
ohio in um pennsylvania where we're both
from
um he's leading all the other candidates
so yes you know i you know your
candidate might be better on
i don't know health care than joe is but
you've got to look at who's going to win
so much
and maybe you have to swallow a little
bit and say okay
i sort of personally like wait is this
go she repeating yourself again
actually i think they they spliced the
clip okay she just admit
that her husband is bad on health care
yes my wife says she's now like me
there's a lot of people better than him
i mean look the
the the the reality is that the polls
show
that um at least the top three
candidates could beat
donald trump but we also know that the
polls showed
that hillary clinton could beat donald
trump
and to the extent that we can draw any
parallels from 2016
to now i said many times before there
was a perfect storm there's a lot of
different things that matched up that
were really
uh that were within and without hillary
clinton's
um ability to control
that impacted the final outcome of that
election
but the one thing that we can say
that is true and that i think allowed it
to be as close as it was
was the lack of
enthusiasm for her candidacy
broadly speaking
and to have a candidate
for whom the enthusiasm is so low
let's make it clear here like there were
obviously
hardcore hillary clinton supporters
there are not hardcore joe biden
supporters
like this is
this is far there is a far greater
deficit if their appeal at this point
is to concede that his policies stink
even his own wife is not a hardcore
biden supporter it seems
we have many friends who are very
depressed and they're good people
jeb's mom energy of jeb's mom energy
it's like sometimes he's incontinent
sometimes he urinates on himself while
reminiscing about running with strom
thurman
but he still pulls well bless me father
five cent
do you think that he goes home to dinner
and says like
sweetheart is there something you want
to tell me and she just goes oh shut up
joe i think he says sweetheart go to
go to joe 303
30 and help me man
we are straight up making fun of
somebody going senile oh
that's his fault for running oh i do and
i don't have a problem with it i'm just
noting it
public figure i don't care um no i don't
i don't think but the whole
main the whole i mean it's look if the
whole argument hinges on polling
bernie sanders dominating
dominating trump in the pulse without
all of the potential downsides you're
identifying yeah it seemed like she was
using
his winning in the polls for the primary
is evidence that
he could beat trump oh he's here that
does well
well aren't all three uh top candidates
are beating trump all of them be trump
nothing like even
harrison i think some of them are
beating him one that isn't beating him
straight up is buddha judge buddha judge
loses
and then the spread gets smaller and
smaller it's like eight to ten
bernie biden then like four to five
warren then like two to three harris
they have to be beating him by enough
that they could still lose otherwise
it's not interesting
there you go so um
all right let's take a look here what we
got uh i that joe stuff really i think
is
a little bit it's a little bit
disturbing i i get i'm it makes me more
and more nervous it's very depressing
it's like seeing the truth i mean on
tracks
from the very beginning i have not been
a a fan of joe biden's
but it really is only since the
just before the first debate where i
started to get that feeling of like wait
a second
this may be worse than that people don't
learn lessons
well yeah i don't know don't bring up
lessons
yeah i don't know what that means go we
should explore that for a little while
lessons let's take up some time
a function of politics not lessons
um all right i mean i think that there's
most i mean
i don't know those numbers for him
though are going to be very resilient
and
the disturbing pattern is is that he
gets like
not dramatic but he seems to get like
these little drops after debates
and then a couple weeks later he's
bounces right the thing to keep in mind
is that we are still in an era where
vast majority of people
are not remotely paying attention to any
of this
absolutely and so uh things like name
recognition
go very far and
i would say they probably help bernie to
a certain extent name
recognition but it helps you know biden
the most
um in terms of just like the names that
people
recognize and
as people pay more attention i think um
i think we will um we will see maybe
some changes
i i hope but we'll see um all right
let's take a look at this um
rashida talib and uh ilmar ilan omar
are uh are back in the news this
is um
i mean this is we're gonna hear a lot
from these folks
for the next year because to a large
extent this is part of the electoral
strategy in 2018
of the republican party which is
to demonize um women of color
and make sure that everyone understands
that the democratic party
is the women of color party and so
um let's just start yesterday
uh there was a press conference at the
minnesota state house
uh both rashida talib and ilhan
omar spoke
here is uh rashida talib um talking
about
her experience um in palestine as a
young girl
as a young girl visiting palestine to
see my grandparents and extended family
i watched as my mother had to go through
dehumanizing
checkpoints
even though she was a united states
citizen and proud american
i was there when my city was in a
terrible car accident
and my cousins and i cried so she could
have access to the best hospitals
which were in jerusalem i remember
shaking with fear when checkpoints
appeared in the small village of beto
tanks and guns everywhere i remember
visiting east jerusalem with my then
husband
and him escorted escorted off the bus
although he was a united states citizen
just so security forces could harass him
all i can do as my city's granddaughter
as the as the granddaughter of a woman
who lives in occupied territories to
elevate her voice
by exposing the truth the only way i
know how
as my detroit public schools teachers
taught me
by humanizing the pain of oppression
and then uh ilhan omar came up
and spoke more specifically about
what this country can do this country
being the united states
to deal with the injustice that is
the israeli apartheid fortunately
we in the united states have a
constructive role to play
we give israel more than three million
dollars in aid every year
this is predicated on there being an
important ally in the region
and the only democracy
in the middle east but denying
visit to duly elected members of
congress
is not consistent with being an ally
and denying millions of people freedom
of movement or
expression or self-determination is not
consistent
with being a democracy we must
be asking as israel's ally the netanyahu
government
stop the expansion of settlements
on palestinian land and ensure
full rights for palestinians if we are
to give them
aid now
before um some of you
send me an email telling me that i'm a
self-hating jew
and why is it that to lib
and ilhan omar and
we on the show why do we criticize
israel when saudi arabia is so horrible
why do we criticize israel when iran is
so horrible or a
syria is so horrible um
let me tell you what emails i never get
why do you criticize the united states
when there are so many other countries
that are just as bad
or worse like what because
the point of criticizing look
i don't know if south africa was
the most oppressive regime in the uh
in the in the world at the time saudi
arabia is still pretty probably pretty
bad back then too
but the point being because
one i have personally just far more
invested in israel than i do
in saudi arabia emotionally
uh two we give obviously three billion
dollars of an a of aid
uh to israel they are far
more interconnected in our politics in
many respects at least publicly than the
saudis to the extent that the saudis are
we criticize them
um this is
the the notion that israel is unique in
getting criticism
uh is is a silly one in terms of
of of the west or from where we sit
i mean i just want we hold them to
higher standards because we consider
them
the only democracy in the middle east
yeah
i mean let's i don't even think we could
do that one ironically and as a joke
anymore but
i mean i'll acknowledge i mean look i
have a lot more emotional investment in
saudi arabia so
it's that's extremely difficult for me
to talk about the
the that elegant monarchy there and how
the standards have fallen
but i think that you know
one is all the reasons that you outlined
absolutely
and even though we could say on a
relative scale there's no doubt that
being in saudi arabia
would in the aggregate be worse in many
respects although
frankly i don't know if you're
palestinian but certainly if you're
even in arab as a second class citizen
inside 67 borders
but there is something very specific and
very unique
about apartheid conditions and about
having a system that specifically
administers
two entirely set different sets of rules
for people based on their ethnic
identity and i mean that in some
respects that is actually very unique in
the world apartheid south africa was
unique the jim crow south was unique
right
israel is unique uh western sahara is
unique
and i think now clearly cashmere is
becoming increasingly unique
though having a set of conditions like
that
that if you know literally
roads for different people right that is
entirely different
justice systems right that is radically
unique
there you go um
meanwhile
you know i've been saying for uh for
years that uh
israel is going to lose the democratic
party
and it is and they i think i have come
to this realization they don't seem to
to care about it what's fascinating is
that now
critique of israel is becoming more and
more
mainstreamed and is becoming less and
less taboo
uh peter beinart who
15 20 years ago was in a radically
different place when it came to israel
part of it is i think i think part of it
frankly is also the
past 15 years in terms of what has
happened in israel 15 to 20 years
has been uh
dramatic in many ways since
um uh rabin was assassinated
i think there has been sort of a growing
awareness
in the center left in this country
that israel has gone further and further
off the rails
as a as a in terms of its politics and
its
leadership and in terms of like where
the population is heading
um and uh peter beinart who
was a big
iraq war advocate and then subsequently
made
what i think is the probably the most
legitimate of all the miya culpas
and then actively working towards fixing
what he missed it wasn't just like
i got that one wrong but i'm going back
at it you know it wasn't like a larry
kudlow like okay
yeah yeah okay nobody bats a thousand
um he he actively like
dedicated himself to understanding why
he got it wrong
and um what he didn't
you know what his uh predispositions
towards that region were
and um here he is on cnn
in what i think is probably one of the
most dramatic
um arguments
about the injustice that's happening in
israel that we've seen on
that you could see on cable news
this is a big deal to see on cable news
um israel critiqued in this manner
by someone who is
considered mainstream by cable news
they're not bringing somebody on
you know because they're they're wearing
a uh a funny hat at a rave party you
know
and uh you know protesting on stilts
nation that he's talking about is called
mifta which is an organization that in
the past has published articles on their
website using phrases like blood libel
which in the past on their website has
praised palestinians who've carried out
attacks against israelis and this was
the organization that was involved with
the planning of that trip
now you heard johann omar refer to that
obliquely
in her statement but is that a type of
organization
that you should be connected with as a
us member of congress
palestinians don't have to be saints in
order to deserve the basic
rights that all of us take for granted
right mifta has said things that i
disagree with they made an anti-semitic
statement
they apologized for the point is when
you go there
i say this is an american jew my
children go to jewish day school i lead
services in an orthodox synagogue
judaism at the center of my life
the first time i went to spend time with
palestinian west bank it was a
shattering
experience the only thing i could
imagine would be similar for american
would be going to visit the jim crow
south
when you see people living under the
control of the state with no rights
they cannot become citizens they cannot
vote for the control for the state that
controls their lives
they do not have free movement they need
a pass to move from city to city they
live under a military legal system
the consequences are more brutal than we
can
imagine sitting here so do i agree with
mifta of course not i had a close friend
who was killed in a suicide bombing
but palestinians don't you could have
made the same argument he went to visit
snick and said oh they were connected
with communists some of their people
have made anti-white statements the
point is
what ilana mars said is the truth is the
most important point people need to go
and see for themselves i've never seen
anyone who's gone and seen for
themselves
and not been transformed by the
experience i
that i think is true and apolitical that
it is worth going to israel worth going
to the west bank so you can see for
yourself you get a real sense of the
situation on the ground rich lowry
on the subject of mifta the other side
of that is that there has been a
congressional trip
that was led by mifta before in the
israeli government let it happen now i
know it was before the actual law was
passed but they didn't need a law to
keep people out if they didn't want to
but they allowed it to happen before
now they're not and claiming it's
because of this organization yeah well
obviously the proximate cause here was
the trump
tweet which highlighted this and made it
a major issue but there is a law
that allows israel to ban foreigners who
support the bds movement to
isolate and delegitimize israel it's
been not applied against members of
congress
before it's been applied against french
politicians against eu politicians
but these are strong supporters of the
bds movement they are not honest brokers
we wouldn't afford a white nationalist
organization
the uh the leeway that peter is giving
this organization oh they're not
saints this is an anti-semitic group
that supported terrorism supports
blowing up
innocent civilians and children and no
matter what you think of the
dispute between the palestinians and uh
israel
that is an illegitimate tactic that no
one should associate with advocates of
i want a quick response to that peter i
don't want to break sure honest raw is
actually very well known as a
non-violent activist been a critic of
the palestinian authority one of the
most important palestinian feminists
there are many palestinians who believe
that palestinians have the use
right to use violence because of the
daily violent oppression they feel
i disagree with them i believe in only
non-violent protest but the point is
every time any palestinian leader or any
palestinian organization
tries to expose what happens this is
exactly what happens
people try to discredit them because
they don't want to talk about the real
issue the real issue is an
absolutely indefensible denial of basic
human rights what's have to do with
supporting terrorism i mean
no one has any problem with harshly
criticizing israel
that's fine but you don't support
blowing up innocent
people that's just a a bottom line uh
no something we all should be on purpose
behind
focusing on this is to try to distract
attention from the reality on the ground
which is funded by america
would you tax dollars our tax dollars
blow up
the homes of people who cannot get
permits to build because they're
non-citizens under military
would this be your standard for white
nationalist organizations
some racist things i support terrorism
with all due respect that's okay you
have not been around
she is nothing close to a white
nationalist she is someone seeking
freedom then why does the organization
why is the organization publish things
supporting terrorism
rich i disagree with violent resistance
but
why because because a lot of
palestinians believe
that because they are subject to daily
violence of a system which denies them
basic rights they have the right to
respond violently
but an african-american who supported
violence against the united states
under slavery or jim crow that did not
excuse
their denial of basic rights because i
disagree with the tactic they were using
to resist it
i mean it's again it's fine to harshly
criticize israel in the occupation
i don't think anyone's is that true
is it true that it's fine to harshly
criticize
israel on the occupation isn't this
entire
i mean look at the look at the chiron
underneath
i mean this whole news segment is a
function
of why it's wrong for
omar ilan and to lib and anybody else
for criticizing israel in this way
i mean the whole premise of why this is
on the news
is not because of mifta nobody watching
this knows who mifta is
the whole premise is like they're
criticizing israel
completely disingenuous but go using to
resist it
i mean it's again it's fine to harshly
criticize israel in the occupation
but i don't think anyone speaks
associated with a group that supports
terrorism and this isn't black and white
i mean they publish this stuff no one's
many names
years ago there were certainties again
has devoted her life as a non-violent
activist to opposing
an oppression which none of us doesn't
do which does not accord with the values
that any of us believe in as a matter if
she doesn't control her own organization
and what it publishes
rich why don't you try spending a little
bit of time focusing on
the fact that almost four billion
dollars of u.s aid is used to put
children into the attention you're the
one distracting from the issue i'm
actually i don't know this is the issue
and just as you defended segregation you
now defend
israel's oppression of palestinian basic
rights it's a tradition for you guys
look and if an organization
that's all it is and every argument they
have is what about ism
it's also just the fundamental
dishonesty that you pointed out that
of course you're not allowed to talk
about the israeli occupation and now
it's just all of a sudden
seamlessly moved into this
lie about this organization and also
frankly like
the distinction between we have to have
some universal standards you have to say
that there are certain actions that
states or groups should not undertake
period or else we just don't have any
ground for anything
but as a broader proposition the notion
that rich lowry has
anything to say about how the
palestinians conduct their struggle
violently non-violently or otherwise i
mean that and and they've been saying
this for years
well that's the point this is so
demented and that usaid
used to put children into the attention
you're the one
and just as you defended segregation you
now defend
israel's oppression of palestinian basic
rights it's a tradition for you guys
look and if an organization supports
terrorism that organization should be on
beyond the pace
when they protest non-violently right so
you're spreading them as well they're
saying that
in some sense justifies terrorism of
course
disagree with terrorism what i'm saying
is you're trying to distract
from the real issue the real issue is
american complicity
in the denial of basic palestine all
right we're going to leave this guy of
your opposition mean we're going to
leave this
in this organization please go there
yourself we're going to leave that
of course you won't it's also just i
mean
of course they won't and of course like
this will keep going like this is
all they've got there's nothing else
this
this is a look the
[Music]
this plays into everything the
republicans want to run on
because they get the angry brown
ladies they get the evangelicals
they prompt the prime for i don't know
uh you know some
some right wing dollars
uh because you really can't
i mean you know i'm not just so critical
of
of the equivocating from warren because
i she's not my candidate
it's because really anybody
in any type of broad claim of
center-left politics that still
calls you know that still says something
like oh well when israel doesn't give
them visas they're undermining their
image as a tolerant democracy it's
it is offensive like the framing
this is indicative of children
this is their governance right and it
should be offensive to
every jewish person in america that any
jews are
supporting this or anyone is supporting
the trump administration somehow in
our name when you know most of their
attention
is on brown people right now and putting
them in camps once they
achieve that they're absolutely gonna
try to do it to us
the jews yup i mean
we become a lot less relevant um

all right folks fun half fun
half oh we're gonna get to phone calls
today
or some and some ims or some
maybe tomorrow just do all phone calls
hello sir hello seriously
maybe i will do that i always threaten
to do it and then i never do it
i mean i don't threaten to do it i'm not
like you know like i don't perceive it
as a threat but i always say that stuff
maybe a fun experiment
uh the great gaslight on i am as this
weekend's pro portland protests further
exposed andy
nyo as a shameless alt-right grifter and
provocateur
let's not forget how the idw tripped
over each other to platform him and
amplify his narrative painting the left
is violent
specifically this guy and you know who
was
where is he from was he from colette oh
yeah he's written for quillette a lot
so he got beat up apparently at um
at uh one of these uh you know clashes
between uh you know white
civic nationalists or whatever they are
and uh proud boys and so on and uh
antifa
and it was all made out to be like
auntie foes attacking
journalists and uh particularly in all
the stuff that went down in portland we
haven't talked about it on the show like
you know i these these are our street
fights it
like i think we've mentioned that it
didn't get terribly violent
uh but there's significant you can find
it
i'm trying to remember who did uh some
of the more comprehensive stuff on
twitter
but the andy noe apparently wasn't there
but was characterizing all these events
through other people's media as being in
one way
and people on the ground were completely
refuting what he's saying uh christopher
mathias
had a good one yeah i think that maybe
is the one that i'm thinking about
from huffpost okay and and so um
it's pretty dramatic but it is just
another example
i mean you know here's the thing it's
hard sometimes to know
whether on the right
there is like a plan behind this
where like the idw guys come around and
platform andy know even though he turns
out to be a complete
shill or if it's just literally like
such a deep-seated lack of integrity
that they don't they don't
either bother to check on these things
or they purposely don't check on them
because they don't
care it's hard to know like tartan you
know
there is there is been a you know for a
long time we used to ask about the bush
administration stupid or evil
and it's also possible at times where
it's both now like
let's take for instance like ben shapiro
here
ben shapiro had this to say
on his show and this is one of those
perfect examples of like
does ben shapiro not like could he be
does he just simply lack the integrity
or does he just
talk without any awareness of where what
he's said in the past like he just
throw stuff off so carelessly
and make these pronunciations because
there's so much he sticks his finger up
in the wind
and and the currents on the conservative
side are so
um cohesive that you just
you just got to do that quickly you know
which way the wind is blowing you blurt
it out
boom you you move up a rung in their
little social
uh you know metrics and they get uh they
get more funding
and that's what he does and that's why
he can't remember anything he said in
the past
or if he just has no integrity and
maybe i'm saying the same thing like
because he has no integrity he doesn't
have to think about what he said in the
past none of it's relevant
and that's what allows him to do this
it's it's it really is a genuine mystery
to me but it's almost like on a daily
basis
that the further this guy goes in his
career
the more he produces in terms of an
output
the more he exposes himself as
a total joke this is a guy that they
called the
the the the prince philosopher of the
writer
yeah whatever it is i mean like honestly
this is how
shallow their their integrity and
intellect is
here is ben shpiro and
and and he could actually be a a fairly
smart guy but i think that because he
lacks such integrity
that there's no rigor
here he is making what is
not even like demonstrable is almost too
weak of a word
to say a demonstrable uh untruth it's
like setting up an alley-oop where you
pass the ball to the guy and then he
dunks on you
it's it's here is ben sparrow exactly
republicans impeached impeached bill
clinton in the 1990s
they never made a move to impeach barack
obama despite the myriad scandals that
cropped up during his administration
i'm not aware of a single major
republican possibility i won't just go
back and set the table here he's talking
about like the trump derangement
syndrome or something
he was black they never had peach
support um now i don't know what the
myriad of scandals were that he was
talking about
like i really honestly don't uh but just
the myriad
the marriott said jerome understand
we're talking about a president in
donald trump
where he's 20
maybe more white house officials have
had to leave
because of like inspector in general
reports
because of criminal investigations i
mean
there's nothing even that remotely you
could go back
and add up various two-time presidencies
and not get anything even remotely close
to this
trump derangement syndrome but that's
what you have but but listen to where
he's going with this because this is
really stunning
you know i mean like we're talking this
is not ancient history he's commenting
on now
barack obama despite the myriad scandals
that cropped up during his
administration
i'm not aware of a single major
republican figure who said that barack
obama was not the legitimate president
of the united states despite the fact
that democrats have claimed that george
w bush was illegitimate they have
claimed that donald trump is
illegitimate
so this is just not true and doubt about
barack obama's belief system
came from barack obama being an
extraordinarily radical figure
barack obama said he wanted to
fundamentally transform the nature of
the country
that's a pretty radical statement all
right well let's put aside
how radical of a president um barack
obama was
the idea that there was
no what did he say um uh there was no
major republican major republican figure
who questioned
obama's presidency it wasn't until
someone pointed out
online like hey you left out donald
trump
who was one of the
top uh birth certificate
truthers in the country
if not the top birth certificate truther
and he's a republican president now
and so shapiro goes on to twitter to
defend this
because like i say like they don't have
they they are blessed with a lack of
integrity that also gives them
a a lack of like sort of examining
anything that's going on it's a very
bizarre
uh sort of trait that they have and then
you can retreat into pedentry
yeah exactly like oh wait a second do
you use an apostrophe there
that doesn't count uh but he goes on he
says
trump was a fringe character for nearly
the entirety of the obama presidency
he wasn't a republican figure he puts it
in quotes
until he ran now i don't know what
report until he was aggressively sought
yeah wait wait i don't know what
republican figure the word
figure means right but that this is the
key like
i'm going to use words that could like
that that really
are defined by me right like that that
are that are open
until he ran you can't name a single
major elected republican official during
obama's presidency who challenged the
legitimacy of his presidency okay so
what ben shapiro has done
allow me to get a little bit uh bench
apparently is he's
postulated two uh two assertions
one is that donald trump was a fringe
character he wasn't a
republican figure until he ran well as
you know
he ran in uh 2015.
here is ben shapiro
uh tweeting in 2011
why i back donald trump on the bench
bureau
at big810am.com back in april 10
2011 teacot tea party
that is a tweet of
ben shapiro's talking about his radio
show
why he backs donald trump in the 2012
presidency undeclared donald trump who
was not even a republican figure
now by figure i meant like um someone
who weighed over a cert
i don't know what the figure means but
he clearly was enough of a republican
figure
that ben shapiro would dedicate an
episode of his show to
backing him but maybe that's just a
one-off
oh except for two days later the magic
of donald trump
written by ben shapiro in town hall
maybe he thought he was gonna run as an
independent this is what's so
funny is that ben shapiro does not even
have like
his whole brand is built on the notion i
mean first he's like
part of this weird kid conservative
thing i was like
the republican obsession with having
like odd teenagers say their talking
points
but he basically
has a brand that's built on being a
thinking person's conservative by uh
like overwhelming college students right
public forums
no and that no but i'm saying let me
finish here on this breitbart whole
career price
of course it's absurd in reality the
birth certificate is specifically geared
towards certain political ends for trump
this is him writing about uh
first it's obviously calculated to
attract the most anti-obama segment of
the conservative base
indeed and is already conceded if
primary polling is any indicator second
it's designed to force obama into
defending his character trump has
already suggested that
at his best obama refuses to come clean
to the american people
finally it shows obama that trump is
nominated the campaign will not be a
mccain style love fest
uh he's writing this in 2011.
understand he's writing this in 2011
in promotion of donald trump to run
against
barack obama
and explaining why this works for
republicans
is donald trump the best republican
candidate for president out there
it would be tough to argue otherwise he
writes
this guy claims he's not even a
republican figure until 2015.
he's got all the makings of a breakout
star he's got bravado and the cash to
back it up if he really runs he won't
have any trouble finding supporters as
he puts it the obama administration's
worst nightmare who can argue with him
okay
so let's go back to the original tweet
that um
that ben shapiro had where he made two
separate assertions
we have already established that
assertion number one trump was a fringe
character for nearly the entirety of the
obama presidency
was a lie he wasn't a republican figure
until he ran
well of course ben shapiro in 2011
certainly thought otherwise
but that of course was only five years
earlier from the time that he ran then
the second assertion that ben shapiro
makes
is that there is you can't name a single
major elected republican official during
obama's presidency who challenged the
legitimacy of his presidency
well um let's go through it shall we
[Music]
do you have those other tweets you have
the
mark meadows video
[Music]
where mark meadows and you know who mark
meadows is right
one of the top republicans the um the
chair of the freedom caucus
do you have the mark meadows stuff
we will pull that up right worth there
is a lot
of folks apparently who were republican
leaders
who questioned donald trump i mean
excuse me uh barack obama's legitimacy
as president
let's start with mark meadows back in
2012. do we have that video
brandon who's in that thread
yep here it is
sorry sorry
he's also moving the goal posts right to
try to define you can't get it off being
a republican figure
hold on um i'm sorry say again he's also
moving the goal post to try to define
trump out of being a quote-unquote
republican figure when he defines it as
a major
elected republican official right like
you don't have to be
an elected official to be a republican
there's no there's absolutely no
version of this where
it's in that thread uh the ben shapiro
thread
right here scroll down people came in
and put it in there go ahead here's mark
meadows
so it seemed like this was settled so it
seemed
like this was settled uh during the uh
during the the meeting what are you
learning now
yeah anderson certainly some new
scrutiny over things that mark meadows
has said
in the past this is first and foremost
something that he said seven years ago
back in 2012 about then president barack
obama it was something at the time
that was quite controversial it was
reported on by many outlets but
certainly given that very emotional back
and forth and high profile
back and forth at the cohen hearing
today it certainly is getting a fresh
look today here's first
what mark meadows said back in 2012.
what we're going to do is take back our
country 2012
is the time that we're going to send mr
obama home
to kenya or wherever it is we're gonna
do it
uh we also had multiple u.s
senators question barack obama's
legitimacy
as president i'm trying to find this
thing now i i can't find it in the
goddamn notes
um we had
shelby from alabama mark
meadows there were dozens
dozens of these people who had done it
so number two on his assertion is
um
is also wrong
trump was a republican figure
and there were plenty of elected
republicans who also failed
richard shelby who's a prominent u.s
senator
in 2009 well his father was kenyan he
said he was born in hawaii but i haven't
seen any birth certificate
you have to be born in america to be
president he told constituents
uh that's i think the senior republican
on the intelligence committee
i mean there's there was there was so
many
who else there was others i had that
list i don't know where it went
where is it here we go
i can't see it i don't know where you're
sending me
oh
all right i can't get at it i i i i
can't see where
oh here we go mark meadows marcia
blackburn louie gohmert break farrenhold
tom coburn james inhofe jason chaffetz
sarah palin michael burgess alan west
half those people ran for president
as a republican
so um to be fair none of them are
prominent republican figures as trump
you know what my favorite thing is is
when you watch ben shapiro
being fed his lunch to him
what he does after that is he starts
tweeting maniacally
about many other topics to get as
to bury this stuff as far as he can in
his timeline
but the idea that you know like
yes here is in las vegas where mitt
romney accepts
the endorsement from donald trump to
happen
to this country that we all love ah now
pause it now wait a second
i also want to just preface it with this
if you look in the corner of the
television
there's three letters there the letters
are p
b s there are plenty of times where a
politician goes around
and gets endorsements from people that
barely make the local news
but when mitt romney went to kiss the
ring of this non-republican figure
apparently
who ben shapiro wanted to be president
in 2012 it made it on to pbs
he's smart he's sharp he's not going to
allow
bad things to continue to happen to this
country that we all love so
governor romney go out and get him you
can do it
was a nice hand pull though yeah
announce that too
there are some things that you just
can't imagine happening in your life uh
this is one of them
uh being in donald trump's magnificent
hotel and having his endorsement
is a delight i'm so honored and and
pleased to have his endorsement and of
course i'm looking for the endorsement
of the people of nevada
yeah there you go gotta praise the hotel
who is that guy
what is he doing there you would think
that it's such an
important part isn't he part of the
resistance in the senate he said we
heard mitt romney's name mention
anything right i was actually going to
say i was actually saying in the context
of 2012 why would you have such a
bizarre obscure non-republican
affiliated figure for such a major
endorsement
so uh ben monsieur uh ben shapiro takes
it again
on the chin i can't wait for the next
new york times uh
think piece on his we'll get another
profile of ben shapiro
oh my god he's brilliant um
all right let's go back to uh fox and
friends they are just
like brian kill mead what the hell is
wrong with the jews
what is wrong with the jews brian
kilmeade wants to know
you talked to evangelicals many of them
went to the polls and voted for the
conservative which was donald trump in
the last election
because of what he would do for judges
because of his pro-life stance and
because of his pro-israeli stance it's
important to a lot of christians are
most christians around the world
for us to support israel but but
stunning
okay i will tell you this she is right
that is probably the
the best analysis i've ever seen
from ainsley earhart uh the part about
the whole christian support for israel
incidentally bad news for uh
for some of us uh jews it's part of a
bigger plan y'all have chicken emporiums
in jerusalem uh it
to my understanding is two-thirds of the
jews
um get sent to hellfire
and uh one-third gets sit on the
right-hand side of god do i get an
offer on the right-hand side of god i
have put in
i will cop to having submitted
a form explaining that i have eczema
and that hellfire but you don't vote
republican man very
it irritates my eczema significantly i
voted for rudy giuliani because i was
concerned about crime
which you could interpret as a
pro-christian vote so i would like to
i did not vote for you i'm not talking
about you i'm talking about more
plausible jewish entrants on the right
you're going to hell dude
you're not making no i you are they
don't care about your ex
oh no you can put in requests i'm sure
you can
like with testing anybody can put in
requests you can put in tests but not
anybody gets on the right side let's see
it but but brian kilmeade
well you can't believe it's like i get
it why the christian support but
we're the jews a lot of christians are
most christians around the world
for us to support israel but but
stunningly most democrats
uh of most democrats support excuse me
uh most the the majority of the american
jewish support goes to democratic
candidates president trump only got 24
percent
when president bush 43 and this
president have been the better allies
uh to israel that's starting to change
you're totally right historically that's
been the case
my true colors are starting to show
incidentally
that's not starting to change in fact
every single
election cycle we are told that that's
starting to change and guess what it has
not changed in fact there is no
group of people in the country who have
changed last
in terms of their voting patterns over
the past i don't know
50 60 years um
i love how kill me it's like wait how am
i going to say this so it doesn't sound
like audition on the jews
are so dumb i mean they're they're
awesome no wait a second i mean
i don't get them don't get me wrong
they're very smart they make a lot of
money
but they vote in a dumb way what's also
like you wonder as he's saying this
stuff and trying to formulate it in such
a way that's not going to be
a sound that he thinks he's going to
sound defensive he's going to step in
something
you wonder if there isn't a moment in
his brain where it just like clicks in
and like wait a second
wait a second we've been sitting here
talking about how criticism of israel is
anti-semitic but why does the majority
of jews
never mind just support democratic
candidates but also support the idea of
holding israel to account
why why would that be that doesn't make
any sense
you wonder if like just in a flash just
like there's like a little hiccup like
you know the thing that makes you like
do this while you're you're sleeping you
think you're going to fall like if that
happens in his brain here let's just go
back occasionally
yeah sometimes i think sometimes you may
you may remember with lindsey graham
well we're talking about nuking the
mulas not all iranians that's not cool
he's afraid to say american jews here
too which is hilarious
for us to support israel but but
stunningly most democrats
uh of most democrats support excuse me
uh most the the majority of the american
jewish support goes to democratic
candidates president trump only got 24
percent
yeah you see aidsly aids is just like i
honestly don't care about any of this
but i would just say be careful because
yeah be careful
we're real touchy about that alert right
alert
careful i got some chicken salad i don't
want to have another one of those
meetings have you ever seen one of them
try to return a chicken salad oh boy
and hey eggs i love hegg's reaction
which is sort of like
wait we're not supposed to we're not
supposed to mention that it's changing
it's changing
yeah right right i think it's really
changing i mean you have you ever heard
of jacksonis
i think i think i think that heck seth
is by far the most likely they're just
like oh i mean
the more are gonna vote for us
he's totally anchorman he's totally i
thought that was a great segment
everybody else is looking at him like
what did you just say
now because you know part of the problem
is that hexis
has to maintain so we watch one clip
where um kilmead sort of comes to the
revelation
and either is just very worried about
saying it in the wrong way
or just actually has a revelation that
makes him stumble a little bit when he's
talking about
jews voting for democrats and therefore
not supportive of israel
it just makes it very hard to do the
whole uh criticism of israel
is anti-semitic thing heg-sith jumps in
to say wait that's changing and part of
the reason why hex has had to do that is
because here's hex to this
right now um making the argument
that oh talib omar
when they attack israel it's uh of
course it's
it's terrorism they
that the point that they made there
exposes their agenda
and then they as you said brian they
went out to say they're not a democracy
and not an ally
i mean they are our strongest ally in
the middle east bar none they're the
only democracy in the middle east
surrounded by countries that want to
kill them and the organization
we're going to get to the second that
was going to sponsor this trip is
supposed to be in charge of palestinian
democracy
you know that 97 of palestinians live
under the palestinian authority
which has not held an election for a
decade because if they held an election
hamas would win just like they did in
the gaza strip hamas is a
dedicated terrorist
he was going to go on to say hamas is a
dedicated terrorist organization
it's like we have we were actually no
longer a dedicated one we haven't been
dedicated for
four years now it's actually
certification no literally hamas has
been yes significantly less dedicated
since 2006. all right folks
uh now for the moment that you've been
waiting for it look there's a lot of
support
that we've had from all sorts of
communities out there saying
why doesn't dave rubin actually sit down
with sam and discuss some ideas
why does steve crowder keep uh
ducking sam cedar um
all the time and we're going to have you
know when we get to september
we're going to roll that out i'm not
exactly sure what we're going to do but
sometime in september
uh we're going to roll out uh some of
the examples of stephen crowder over the
past uh
year or so uh ducking debates
but people are getting sick of it even
people that you wouldn't imagine
i give you tell me lauren
from uh is she still on the blaze tv or
blaze or wherever oh she's definitely on
the blaze anymore abortion that's right
she's
off the off the blaze uh but tell me
lauren
here she is hey hey tommy laron here
so i wanted to say to dave steven and
others stop being cowards and debate sam
already my goodness get to it
those are my final thoughts god bless
take care and remember
get your debate on there you go
there you go folks uh gabby has spoken
there he goes uh tommy tell me lauren
tammy tammy where did she be
hey hey tommy laron here so i wanted to
say to dave steven and others stop
being cowards and debate sam already my
goodness get to it
those are my final thoughts god bless
take care and remember
get your debate on might get your debate
on it
now we should probably just say that uh
at dr
underscore ill there did paid
tommy to say this on the platform cameo
where you can play
you sort of minor celebrities to you
know i'm sorry okay
so do you think matt that tommy lauren
is just gonna say something just for the
money no never mind
i mean honestly uh yeah she got 60 bucks
to say that
but if she didn't believe it do you
think that she would say that for 60
bucks
you're right right i doubt it i mean i
think there's a lot of cynicism in this
business but i think we
i think she needs to you know when she
says dave stephen
go uh debate sam she means it i think
it's
it's a sign that the uh the masculine
right is losing the females
it's true it's true it really is true
she's not that hard up for 60 bucks okay
guys she would never say something that
she doesn't believe in
of course not i mean
cucks unite right like i mean
really appreciate it really appreciate
if you're unimpressed or
tommy tommy uh yeah just don't be like
crowder be like majority report
there you go be a man sack up and debate
i think we gotta that thing's gotta be
dispersed uh far and wide folks

savings is
to like normal people so you know you're
talking about
how a lot of normal people don't get the
idea of what you're gonna save
because you know it's part of your
employment you know
um anyway but those people are not gonna
have to pay
all the taxes that they're paying
currently
you know whether it be they own their
own homes
all that money that they pay for
insurance through that avenue
isn't going to have to be paid like you
know for teachers
at least i'm sorry i don't i don't
understand what you're saying john
okay so say you know like here
um sorry i'm a little nervous
um so like property taxes right
girls to pay for schools and teachers
and all that
right medicare for all
right that's you know that amount isn't
going to be paid through that avenue
so right like six percent of say your
your school taxes
is not going to be there anymore because
that's going to be paid federally
no no the taxes
the the proposals have nothing to do
with property taxes your property taxes
are going to stay the same
you're going to pay an additional tax
for your health insurance
and you're not going to pay anything in
terms of premiums or co-pays you're not
going to have any
deductibles
it's conceivable that your pay may go up
at work in certain
circumstances conceivable
because you know all employers are going
to be off the hook to pay for their
health insurance they're going to have
an
increase in taxes but whatever that
delta is the difference between that
um eventually i think in
in some instances workers should
have the ability um
to capture some of that um that
difference
but largely largely the savings for
um for your average
american is going to be in
the um the
the the no co-pays
no deductibles no
uh no caps and your insurance is going
to cover more things
you're not going to have to worry about
being in a plan or out of a plan or any
of that
well my point was you know you're saying
that the employer doesn't have to cover
that so there's going to be a savings
there right
well there is going to be a savings
there but it's going to depend because
you know it's sort of going to depend on
what their outlying is because they're
also going to be taxed
well the federal government is one of
the largest employees
so that's what i'm saying like there's
not going to be
that cost to teachers policemen
who all get you know basically federally
subsidized
health insurance now where instead of
right now we're paying it to private
agencies so they're basically
not basically they're they're making 20
extra where you would save that with a
medicare for all system or you're paying
what
okay oh i see what you're saying i see
what you're saying i see what you're
saying so
you're saying that municipalities uh
places that hire government workers
uh they're gonna have savings on um
i mean they're still going to cost money
but yes well i mean that's where
efficiencies are going
i see what you're saying though but
because because the government is paying
that 20
delta that 20 profit that private
insurance gets
um you're saying that that is going to
be a savings that's going to accrue
to municipalities and yeah that's
interesting i i hadn't contemplated that
uh i'd have to look into that and
because i don't know frankly like that
still moves down
i don't know what the uh
health uh plans are for employees of
let's say
uh teachers in new york city and i don't
know
who administers those but i would
imagine they are
you know the new york city uh probably
negotiates with some type of private
insurance company
and then they insure these people and
the insurer in the insurance company
now it's conceivable like when you start
doing large employers
the insurance company is basically just
charging an administrative fee
they're not actually the insurers the
the the entity itself
actually does the insurance um and so
i don't know i have to look into that
there may be savings there though i see
what your point is i'm not i i haven't
heard much about it but i will look
into that appreciate it it seems like a
john from san antonio
uh a question to look through it's an
interesting question
pretty good yeah i can say that again
appreciate the call
hey okay you got one more
[Laughter]
sorry you should pay tommy lauren to get
sam not hang up on you
calling from a 606 area code who's this
where you calling from
good afternoon everybody can you hear me
okay yes
who's this okay all right this is joe
from uh
richmond virginia hey joe how you doing
i'm doing all right just getting some
dinner made for later today
uh but i wanted to make a comment about
uh
a subject i think you all talked about
this last week see i'm a kentucky native
and i live there most of my life i've
lived in both the rural
and the urban parts of the state and
this concerns
mitch mcconnell in 2020. uh
i hate to break into everybody but get
ready to blame the electorate
because the story is that everybody
hates mitch mcconnell in kentucky
nobody likes it you won't be able to
find anybody who says
i love mitch but when
it comes time to go the voting booth the
republicans
in all the rural areas will do exactly
as they're told they'll go over
and they'll pull the lever for him every
time
and the reason they do this is because
the kentucky democratic party is frankly
a pathetically myopic organization
in and you can see this just by looking
at amy mcgrath's uh
campaign launch which is trying to
portray herself as being pro-trump
because they think this is a you know a
really clever strategy of trying to
confuse the voters as to who the real
republican is in the race
right but i mean look it's just a matter
of
are you gonna are you gonna pick the
original republican are you gonna pick
the diet coke republican
they pick the real one every time i
don't know my perspective
i just want everybody to be prepared my
perspective my perspective about
uh kentucky is just like anything that
just you know keeps him busy
and makes and draws resources is
probably helpful in that respect
you know we're going to end up doing a
pickup probably my guess is
arizona maine
texas seems not impossible but i would
say
unlikely but i think arizona and maine
there's gonna be pickups
i think we're not gonna like uh the
senator from arizona
i think the senator from maine will end
up being sort of like a
angus king type of guy probably um
which i think is gonna be fine um but
yeah kentucky i think
it's tough it's tough but that doesn't
sound like blaming the electorate that
sounds like blaming the terrible
kentucky democratic party
i mean yes they are terrible but there's
a certain
there's a way to break through to them
and i think it's
if we had a bernie sanders at the top of
the ticket and you had
a congressional candidate and for our
case a senate candidate who
would echo that same message you can
undermine what about the talk show host
the ruse of republican support what
about that isn't there
isn't there a prominent sports talk show
host that's thinking about making that
run
do you know what i'm talking about yes
what about yes i know
i know who you're talking about i hope
he runs i hope he runs and he can
challenge amy mcgrath but the
establishment is going to be
400 percent behind her just like they
were
when you know a big political mover and
shaker in the state jerry lundergan
supported his daughter allison lundergan
grimes
to face mitch mcconnell last time they
pushed everybody out with money
i mean it seems and i think this is a
familiar story to everybody
absolutely i mean it seems like it
tracks with uh like a more intense
version of our understanding
of the electorate generally and how
trump won which is that
the rabid republicans who are mostly
not poor they are mostly rich or
uh small business owning people who
always vote republican
uh they come out in full force and then
the people who would be voting for
democrats
are either so they're poor they're
miserated and
they are being suppressed as voters both
um
explicitly with unjust laws or uh
more in more subtle ways like we're
beaten down under democrats we're beaten
down under republicans
why bother showing up to vote like the
the main
predictor of whether or not someone
votes the strongest predictor
is their income and kentucky is a state
beset by poverty
so it makes sense in kentucky that the
primary turnout would be among
republicans right well isn't the other
iran
turnout during the election of matt
bevin was
like in the low 20 percent it was
terrible
and and i think that is part of the key
to republican success that's definitely
true
uh and let me just sneak in one question
and then i can
you know let you guys discuss this more
and that is
uh what do you guys think of this
particular argument for health care
as far as say bernie or elizabeth warren
pushing this
is that when people say it can't work in
the united states because we have so
many people
versus other countries that have
single-payer i guess
what do you guys think of this as a
retort it's like so economies of scale
don't exist suddenly when we're talking
about healthcare now
right so that's my question yeah well
in fact that is the whole point of uh uh
i mean
the savings comes from frankly that uh
that dynamic yeah put on your andrew
yang math hat when you uh
dish that one out there was an old rand
paul clip where he accidentally made
that point in a senate hearing where
he's just like wouldn't make sense the
poll was larger
and then somebody else i don't remember
it might have been bernie was like yeah
there is a very large pool that we could
have for health care
that's available uh let's go to the
phone call from an eight one eight area
code who's this where you calling from
hi sam it's dave from jamaica dave
from jamaica how are you dave i'm gonna
do some quick
plugs um for mr adjacent people
uh the dissident peasant i also heard
your
running mate for the libertarian ticket
or is that fake news
but um i think that's self-appointed on
his part i haven't uh
biden style he floated himself it's a
libertarian approach to building a
ticket
so he's done a very interesting article
on the brief history
of the second amendment so let's ideas
there so
i would suggest people go to patreon
support them it's good stuff
um also from the tmbs discord
kentucky fried comrade from the into
deep podcast
is debating jessie lee peterson so that
would be interesting all right forget
the dates but you guys could get details
on that
is there anything that doesn't debate
jessie lee peterson
oh yeah maybe i should have passed on
that like stick in all covers
um and of course every single human
being talks to jessie lee peters
wow i don't think i i don't think i have
tolerance for that
what are you gonna do with dave when are
you on twitter i couldn't hear you mike
when do you want deck to debate jesse
dave
i don't know i am halfway to never i
suppose
but
um also i think last plug
master debater and man with largest head
of
mike from pa is doing his twitch stream
very
successful good so i would suggest
people to jump on that one
uh other than that um i think i'm almost
done with plugs
oh yeah literary hangover and antifa and
of course
as well you might throw in the majority
guys while you're at it i mean
well i'm on the majority report you know
slogan the majority report while the
majority report
it never hurts it never hurts i do it
you stoked for tonight's tnbs
of course always going to call in we're
going to talk later dave
very nice nice to you to say i would be
right it wasn't necessary
i'll try to i have one last question to
ask everybody
on the show and you guys can respond
afterwards do you love black people
every single one this couple
i love black people amazing
amazing well amazing calm from a 367
area code what is a man
367. hello
hello hello
hello can you hear me yes who's this
hi i'm david colleen from hungary i'm a
big fan
oh well thank you for calling what's on
your mind david
uh first nice to talk with you guys or
first prime caller or acting second time
color
uh for uh yeah okay so i might just get
to it
so first of all i i'll ask uh
i'll ask two questions you first you
said uh
by ending of october you expect that uh
joe biden will be third in the polls
yeah and i just want to say that people
should understand that
even if joe biden is third in the
national polls
which i personally don't think is gonna
happen
my my personal belief is by at the end
of super tuesday next year
bernie kamala harris buddhijet is going
to be over for them because you got to
understand
what's the worst case scenario for joe
biden he loses
iowa he loses new hampshire in all the
states i checked all the polling on rcp
average
he's still ahead in georgia alabama
south carolina
over nevada mississippi by the time
super tuesday is over he will still be
the leader
in delegates so i just don't think that
from your audience perspective i think
biden is still overwhelmingly the
favorite people forget those super
tuesday states
i remember last primary hillary clinton
got so many delegates
from after super tuesday was basically
over so in my opinion i believe that
by super tuesday we already know who the
democratic nominee is
and i i sincerely believe that and i
think just look at the average of all
the southern states you see
first off i would say that like as we
get closer
my my prediction about him being third i
get a little bit more nervous about it
but i'm staying with it just because
i'm going down with the ship but
the theory is this that those
leads in those later states
are bullied largely by older
african-american voters
in in those states and it is predicated
upon
what frankly his wife was pitching
uh yesterday which is that joe biden can
win
there is no better refutation to the
idea that joe biden can win
than him losing in new hampshire and
iowa
and if he loses in new hampshire and
iowa it's going to implicate those polls
in a big way it's going to it's
i mean it's going to influence i should
say because because
you know you're taking you're looking at
a snapshot and it's predicated more than
any other candidate
joe biden's support is founded on a
belief that he can beat donald trump
that he
more is the is the best bet to beat
donald trump
but if he loses and if he does poorly in
the debates
his i believe his support is more
sensitive to
that than others because
i'm not uh because i guess that's the
argument
that's okay sorry that's that's a great
point
but i also want people to because i
don't think a lot of people understand
like i have cousins in atlanta and in
you know in georgia in the u.s and all
of them are surprised
are voting for biden they and i and i
told them all the policies they still
support biden
in fact like they hate come on
braden is their number one supporter so
i think why do they hate buying
why do they why do they support biden
did you ask them why
most of them say that they think he can
win and because of obama
i think a lot of people especially dude
right now you don't want the democratic
no i get you
that's what that's that that that's
consistent with what
i'm arguing if he loses in iowa and in
new hampshire
particularly if he comes in third in one
of those places
it's it's gonna be it's gonna be tough
because he's gonna have to sell like i
can win i just can't win in
iowa and i just can't win in new
hampshire let let me let me
let me put another question to you do
you believe if bernie
sanders doesn't win iowa he has a
realistic part to the nomination
can you realistically see bernie sanders
beating joe biden in any of the southern
states
realistically so isn't it iowa or boss
for bernie sanders
right now if we're being um
i think if he comes in
i think if he comes in uh close second
in iowa and he wins in new hampshire
um i think he's got a pretty good
i think he's got a pretty good shot i
mean the one thing that you have to
understand in terms of
of sanders staying in the race the idea
that he would drop out after super
tuesday
just not going to happen he has the
money he's going to do well in
california
he could win in california but
yeah but i'm not talking about what's
going to happen i'm just talking about
that
i believe after super tuesday the the
chances are very very high
and then he'll and he will be ruled out
of the nomination process
all right i feel like and i feel that
you're all right you have to know that
because you're fighting out of strong
blacks
well we also have to remember i gotta
let them go there's an x factor here
that is very hard to measure
because all of the polls are of likely
voters
right but the x factor is unlikely
voters people who don't normally vote
especially young people and poor people
who might potentially come out for
bernie sanders and skew the data in that
way
we don't know yet if that's going to
happen but it happened for jeremy corbyn
and i think it could
happen for bernie right
and i mean i think there's that that's
definitely uh
there's a potential for that
call from a 206 area code who's this
where you calling from
oh hi this is emily from brooklyn hi
emily what's on your mind
hey um i have kind of a meta question
and since you've got a full house today
i'll open this question to everyone
um i was wondering what is the earliest
thing
you remember like be it something you
read or watched or
something in the news etc that began to
move your social and political views to
the left
like what age did that happen for you
and what started that process
oh geez um
my the answer i usually give is
um i remember watching the run up to the
war in iraq
and especially this shock and awe thing
is right when i got a tv in my room
and i remember watching it being like oh
this is kind of weird and then i think i
was also listening to a lot of like
radio
um out of minneapolis kfan the sports
talk channel but that also had a bunch
of liberals on there and it was
basically that sort of
era yeah i'm
i'm a little bit older than matt but um
the iraq war
definitely uh weighed heavily on my
political development as well i remember
i was still in high school when i
protested the iraq war
along with millions of other people
across the country
and it didn't do anything and i was like
wow maybe our government isn't actually
working the way it's supposed to
that combined with having to survive on
my own in the world
after college during the great recession
um made me feel pretty disillusioned
with not just
the republican party but obama and the
democrats as well
and um combined with occupy wall street
made me think we need some more radical
solutions if we're actually going to
fix the problems in the world uh
michael is not here what um we wha what
was the first
we we just repeat it
the question yeah oh
so yeah just what was the earliest thing
that you remember
like whether it was something you had
like read or watched or something that
was happening in news that
began to move your social and political
views to the west
i uh the the two things that come to
mind is that just
uh because of we had a decent-sized
backyard in worcester
our neighbors down the street were uh
committee chairman for mcgovern
mcgovern came to our house to campaign
in the backyard when i was like six
um i don't think i knew the ideology but
i knew i was against nixon
at that point and then i think just
stories
maybe my dad was on the human rights or
the civil rights
commission in uh in in worcester and
just hearing
those stories i don't know i don't know
if there was
what i don't remember exactly beyond
that
um i don't know
that was it though but uh michael's not
here good question appreciate the call
yeah thanks guys have a good afternoon
bye-bye
i'd never really thought about that
before
i feel like also maybe i was
i associated with the
american indians when i was a little kid
i don't know why
not like i didn't i didn't i mean i i
actually had a counselor i think at one
at camp who was
uh had some
uh native american i don't can't
remember exactly but i was young
then i got into that i was just i
identified with with indians more than
the cowboys
sure also i started dating a communist
and as everyone knows i just want to be
where the boys are there you go
call from a 201 area code who's this
where you calling from
hi this is jimmy from jersey jimmy
from jersey what's on your mind
hi thanks for taking my call i'm calling
in to
talk about uh veganism uh
i think that it's the uh most
important uh i think that the animal
rights movement is the most important
movement of the century i think it's
essential
uh to address public health climb to the
climate clinic
the climate crisis uh and the animal
cruelty crisis
i want to take a step back for a second
i do realize
that i'm talking to somebody who is on a
show that uh
absolutely glorifies meat consumption
uh it's called bob's burgers should be
called
bob's uh dead cows on a bun
well to be fair to be fair
last night i had an impossible burger
for the first time
and that was actually really good
yeah uh so i don't i'm not aware that
bob's burgers isn't
a completely vegan uh
burger joint but i assume it's not but
yes
okay but into uh in my defense too
i understand that my character is not in
any way affiliated with the restaurant
in fact it's considered in some respects
it's nemesis
so oh yeah you're you're actually the
crusader
yeah inspector yep yeah uh so
so that's that's awesome that you uh
tried an impossible burger
you know and i realized i'm kind of
calling in because you guys have done
some great
uh discussion on this compared to uh
other left-wing shows
and kind of like you know
i guess i'd like to get you to talk the
talk before
walking the walk i i mean walk the walk
before talking to talk so
yeah i mean after having an impossible
burger do you feel like
you know that you want to uh make that
transition
towards a more plant-based diet you
personally without a doubt
i mean my feeling was like i'm not i'm
not ordering a burger here again anymore
my my son likes to go to this burger
place basically i figured out because
there's a tv there
uh and um and
now i make him sit with his back to the
tv and he just like he'll hug me
and then just actually use that as an
excuse of watching the tv
but i i last night i was like i'm not
ordering a burger here again
i'm only gonna get this and that's and i
have to say in terms of my red meat
consumption
um i've already been
made a conscious effort to cut down on
that i mean i
i may have a steak four times a year
now and uh you know a burger i don't
know
another half dozen times a year maybe
but that burger the burger's done um
but i yeah the tough part for me would
be more like
fish uh and some
chicken but i i you know progressively
i'm eating less and
and some pork i guess in the context of
like sausage occasionally well we're the
last generation that's even going to be
able to eat fish so that won't be a
problem for very much longer
right the pescetarians that's there's
they're going to be self-correcting
i'm a pescetarian currently um i was
vegetarian from the age of 12 to 18.
vegan from 18 to i want to say 32
and now i eat eggs and seafood a little
bit in my diet
i will say that what you do on an
individual level
really doesn't matter that much in terms
of the world
um we're going to have to ramp down meat
production
by a lot if we want to save the planet
and
this is one thing that i would hope
people would vote to do
if we ever take democratic control over
production
um and that in that case yes people are
going to need to be sold
on less meat for everyone but until that
happens
your personal lifestyle choices um i
mean they're great for you
i don't like i just said i don't eat
most kinds of meat but
it's going to need to happen on the side
of production rather than consumption in
order to make a difference
yeah so if i can respond to that uh
you know i very strongly disagree that
uh what we do
uh you know doesn't matter you know uh
that it doesn't make a difference i
think it makes
all the difference i mean like if we're
not going to change our habits if we're
not going to do
anything then how are we going to solve
the problem we're just going to wait for
fish to go extinct
you know like we need to do something
and we need to do what we can
and you know speaking to somebody you
know who i'm really happy to know that
you know that you do things about this
and that you you were a vegan at one
point
uh and i assume you know there's a point
where
you know you you look at this stuff you
see what really happens because it's not
just the
the climate stuff it's it's an animal
cruelty crisis you know
and like just looking at you know
looking at what happens to them and you
know letting yourself feel remorse for
that
and you know like
i let myself cry about it you know i
feel remorse about it it's a
it's a terrible thing that's happening
to the to this whole planet you know
what we do just as a species you know
how we just
use other species you know however we
see sid you know
being in that state of mind which i'm
sure you've been in before i'm sure
you've seen it before you know
there must have been a time where you
had that state of mind
and you knew that saying that
you know just saying oh what i do
doesn't matter like those excuses
that people make for not being vegan you
know
that they're you know like
we need to take responsibility for what
we do and we're the cause of this
each and every one of us you know i mean
i
i i i i can only tell you that
that from the perspective of like
um having spent um a decent amount of
time living in a rural area
that there's you know when you
there's a there's another perspective
that
particularly people who you know farm
have
and um not necessarily like
big farms but you know i had neighbors
up there
they will they'll buy two pigs you know
in the
you know early spring late spring
uh and then they'll slaughter them in
october and that'll be the
the food that they eat for this for the
for the winter uh
or they'll shoot a deer and that'll be
the other meat that they have for the
winter um
there there's you know people you live
on a farm you see
animals go at it with each other kill
each other
sometimes um and you just get a sense of
like
this is we're all just sort of living
entities and we all end up back in the
soil
on some level and it's just part of a
cycle
um i mean i think well the difference
the difference between nuts and animals
is that
you know we can think about this we can
you know make the decisions and we can
take responsibility for it
and you know when animals kill each
other you know
i mean that is what they're supposed to
do you know
uh in nature that doesn't dictate you
know what we're supposed to do what
we're supposed to do
is you know make good decisions well but
i mean
i mean what i believe we're supposed to
i'm sympathetic with your perspective
but how do you know what we're supposed
to do
well here's the thing like i'm well wait
a second i just want i'm just i'm i'm
asking i i
i think everything you're saying in
terms of the practical
issues i i agree with
but but how do you know what we're
supposed to do as humans
well you know that that is an
interesting question i i think that we
decide what we're supposed to do
right i don't i don't know in like uh in
like a metaphysical sense you know i'm
not like a religious person
but i think that well
i could take it from a i could go at
this instead of from a religious
perspective from a biological
perspective
uh i think that if there is a god he's
telling us hardcore you know you guys
need to stop eating meat there's a
public health crisis too
you know wait a second but we would
actually look at the body i just wanted
humans nothing about our biology well
wait a second but that uh
requires us to eat meat we uh you know
anatomically we don't have anything that
even allows us to eat meat
without using technology to cook it
there's you know we we are
physically understood i understand there
are plenty animals that can eat meat and
also non-meat um
and but i guess my point is from a
practical standpoint and and from
everything you're saying
but in terms of like what we're supposed
to do we don't know
and so i my only thing i would say to
you is that i think like you know for on
a practical level
i think i think uh jamie's point i think
is well taken
that you know our individual habits are
not going to what's
going to you know sort of necessarily be
the change but our individual habits
certainly inform our politics and
certainly inform the politics of other
people
and we can bring about sort of a
societal
change on on big questions like this in
terms of like
our agriculture and our our uh
you know the way that we deal with these
things i i would just say that like
um i think it's a trickier sell frankly
and i don't think it's
um i think it's a trickier cell to say
about like you know what
what we are are not supposed to do what
part of us are simply animals and what
part of us have the ability to rise
above
uh our animal instincts um
but yeah the moral appeal is not going
to be
effective for the greatest number of
people like i
share the goal of wanting people to eat
less meat
for the animals for health for the
planet um
i think the most effective way to do
that and the most effective arguments
for most people
will be that we need to have a habitable
planet because when it comes down to
morality
it's entirely subjective unless there's
like
you know everybody believes in the same
moral system everybody believes in the
same like
platonic ideals somewhere in the sky
like it's very hard to prove that
something is
immoral when it comes to something that
has so little agreement like animal
rights
um well i i think that i think it's just
really important just on on the subject
of you know
environmentalism is because this is also
this is the number one cause of species
extinction
you know uh we're using more land for it
than we are for almost anything else
uh and i just think that like
you know we're living in a mass
extinction right now and
you know if we don't as a species
and i mean you know i'm not necessarily
uh
you know i don't know how successful i'm
going to be i haven't practiced this you
know i don't know how successful i'm
going to be in
changing people's minds but you know uh
it's important that uh
that we as a species if we're going to
have an environmental movement
that people stop uh you know start to
see
all life on this earth as being valuable
people kind of start to realize that
you know we're all you know uh we're all
on this planet together
i mean look we have a problem we treat
each other with respect we're gonna
kill ourselves i agree but i mean i have
to remind you
that
17 years ago 15 years ago
we were killing
tens of thousands of people
ultimately we killed hundreds of
thousands of people
and if you walked around i was a fully
grown adult at this time
you walked around and asked people about
it nobody
nobody nobody gave it a second thought
nobody gave it a second thought
i mean so there are limitations
uh on a human's ability to give a crap
about
other people and that is a um a reality
and it's it's also it's it's going to
make it that much harder for them to
give a crap about
animals which is why i say
that in terms of achieving
your ends if they are strictly to
save as many animal lives as possible
that making it about morality is
probably the hardest
route to go to get to that end frankly
but
all right we're out of time interesting
stuff though i appreciate the call
thank you all right bye-bye all right
folks
gotta go got a little caught up a little
bit later than i thought we got a couple
more ims but uh
