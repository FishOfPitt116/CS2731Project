so
um
this is pretty nuts uh this is baraboo
wisconsin ladies and gentlemen let me
just say this before we click to this
about i don't know close to 12 years ago
i don't know what it is we'll play it
soon actually because we're coming
coming up in the season i was invited on
cnn
to debate with the head of uh
women for america a guy named bob knight
the the con sorry concerned women for
america who's
you know head of the organization was a
guy named bob knight
and um at that time they couldn't find a
woman to
you know i'm concerned this was i got
the concerned part this is not the woman
part
i'm concerned this is all the way back
way back
in the uh arts he was the greatest ally
ever
and he was um
he was on we were having i guess uh a
debate
about um about uh
the war on christmas and um
he uh brought up i think it was a school
in wisconsin
where they were not singing
uh they were not using the name jesus in
silent night they had changed the words
or something now of course they had done
this like five or six years earlier
and it was once what did they change the
words to like earth
mother night old cold night or something
i don't know what it was
thank you mother earth and yeah children
he he was um you know you cherry pick
these things and um
uh you know his arguments like this is a
slippery slope yes there's only one
school that is saying this but
you know the concept of a slippery slope
in and of itself is does not stand
um is not sound in a vacuum right it's a
function of like
what how much of a danger if we head in
this direction
how likely is heading in that direction
what are the trends that are going on
so it's one thing to cherry pick
something and say hey this is a real
problem
what are the what are the contexts that
are leading to this
are we seeing other things in society
that are creating an environment
where something like this happens and
therefore is it dangerous
back in uh the air america dates we
would talk about uh
state lawmakers who are introducing all
sorts crazy bills and people would
i remember we would get criticized by by
journalists like you can find
that guy you know who's introducing that
crazy build that like
fetuses can feel pain you know in in
iowa or indiana or something like that
but that's never going to be law unless
of course
and then of course it is um you know
then you have like uh full
states uh legislatures voting on it and
maybe it getting uh
vetoed by a governor sometimes maybe not
so um with all those caveats said
here is a picture
from a barbarou wisconsin these are a
high school students
at the local high school
and uh i don't know if
barbaroo is
like is this an official account
i don't know if it is i don't think it
was an official city account i'll look
here
um i'm trying to find my story on it i
have it right oh it's it's uh
it calls itself a parody account of
baraboo so we all
did a baraboo city wisconsin parody
account so that's what
originally posted this now the tweets
are protected
i see interesting um
this is like it's a protected parody
account
laurie m muller the baraboo school
district superintendent wrote to parents
on monday saying the photo was taken
last spring
she said it was not taken on school
property or the school-sponsored event
but others in the community said the
photos were associated with the school's
junior prom all these kids are dressed
in a suit
uh let's take a look at this picture can
you get it up there
are a ton of kids
and they're all giving the nazi salute
almost all whoa almost oh they're
engaging in an open exchange of ideas
that's right hi geez and um
it is all at the thing now there are uh
there's one or two kids who are not and
one of them
is this kid up in the uh far right of
the
frame and uh his name
is is his name jordan blue yep and i
retweeted him on twitter recently he's
on twitter
okay and um he didn't uh he didn't
salute
and we have like apparently he posted
something as to an explanation of this
is that right
one parent called the baraboo high
school environment stifling there were
a lot of confederate flag tattoos and
people throwing the n-word around
but there wasn't a super diverse
population at the time this is
someone whose school went there uh kid
went there in 2012.
um and here is jordan blue
he posted uh apparently this picture
just went live
in the past day or so and so he posted
this yesterday
my name is jordan blue i'm the boy
captured in the photo to the far right
the photo was taken during our junior
prom photos
clearly i'm uncomfortable with what was
happening i couldn't leave the photo as
it was taken within five seconds
the photographer took the photos telling
us to make the sign
i knew what my morals were and that it
was not to salute something i firmly
didn't believe in
i attended bhs that's probably babaru
high school
these classmates have bullied me since
entering middle school
i've struggled with it my entire life
and nothing has changed these are
boy these are the boy of class of 2019.
nothing has been done and my question is
with anything
and i think it's supposed to be will
anything ever be done
i truly and firmly believe we need to
make a change to this horrible act it
needs to stop
bullying immaturity and just taking
things as a joke
and look the bottom line is
when the president united states gives
some tacit approval for this stuff
uh it starts to infect
the uh society
and i imagine the majority of these kids
maybe it's a hope but i i i i believe
it's the case
we'll look back on this and feel some
regret
as they get older and understand the
implications but not all of them
this guy right here he's you know
flashing the uh
white powers can i never get another uh
blog about how that's not technically a
white power symbol after this
is just a coincidence that he's throwing
that up as everyone's sick hailing
right i mean um
but the idea that they're not that that
it's
that it's even like uh we're at the
point where they could do this
as a as a as a joke without context like
i mean i get like look
i i've watched you know the the the
springtime for hitler
and the you know the producers it's
hilarious
um but this is not that joke
this is look what we can do yeah like
what's the joke
right they give there's no they don't
leave any ambiguity there when they say
we even got the black kid to throw it up
which by the way it doesn't look like he
is i'm not sure
um but if it's clear they know exactly
exactly what they're doing right yeah
it's hard to see
the joke is look what we can get away
with and that's the way these things
progress
so real problem all right
