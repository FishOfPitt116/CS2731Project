i want to remind you
candace owens the number two is she
number two
at turning points turning points usa has
had a very difficult
go of things as of late i i think they
were um
they they were exposed as to having very
little savvy
when it came to setting up a twitter
account in the uk
uh they didn't wait for verification and
then
some rapscallions um created
other uh tp uk accounts
and no one could tell which ones the
real ones were they were so close to
parity
the legit tp uk
that uh people had trouble telling them
apart
and then somebody goes and digs around
on the uh success of their
uh facebook advertising campaigns and it
turns out
a an organization dedicated
to trying to propagandize
to college students their biggest
uh all of their campaigns seem to
resonate most with
um the men over the ages of 65.
now i i don't want to
go too far i don't want to lean too far
out ahead of my skis
because it's possible a lot of those
people were returned to college
folks
i don't know and then at candace owens
over in great britain again
promoting the expansion of tp tp uk
um basically said you know
hitler the his nationalism at home was
okay
it was that he tried to um it was
his sort of i don't think she used the
word imperialism but it was just that he
tried to
global globalism globalism the only bad
stuff that hitler did was the stuff that
she's mad at jews for doing right
the globalism was the bad stuff the
stuff at home she was just trying to
make germany better
you know make germany great right i mean
make germany great again make it just
more more
german if you will more national right
and so then she got into hot water and
apparently
uh she had to go on a tour where she
pretended she was misunderstood
and unfortunately they um
let her describe what she said and it
didn't really
um work out any better here she is
on lou dobbs and um
you know who better to uh to speak
to to walk through this minefield uh
than lou dobbs
great to have you here uh let's start
thank you for having me
well it's great to see you i i want to
start by addressing some of the remarks
of yours
from late last year that were dredged up
by a leftist advocate
advocacy group positive just you know
late last year
as if like okay that's um a month and a
half ago
and they weren't dredged up uh they
did a public like they were on stage
this is not like they dredged it up from
from a conversation you were having a
titanic at a pub
yeah exactly they had to go they had to
really go way down to the depths
like almost like to the website that you
run
and actually pull it off the website
to attack you claiming you seem to
defend hitler while explaining the term
nationalism uh
your your thoughts i know you tried to
straighten this thing out last friday
you know yeah well look you and i both
know what this is obviously
the left has me as a major target
because i have been effective at
delivering conservative principles to
the black american community
plain and simple i'm the number one
target because i am leading
a revolution called blexit which is
going to encourage black americans to
finally look
at the real history the very racist
history not for nothing
but if you're leading a revolution and
you have to explain what the name of it
is
it may not be quite the revolution you
think it is
it is caught the struggle for indian
independence everyone's talking about it
the salt march let's see it'll make our
head spin
finally look at the real history the
very racist history
of the democrat party which has not
served us so first they ignored me
okay then they laughed at me and now
they are fighting me at every turn
they're going to try this ridiculous
thing the most ridiculous
deposit again i'm sorry to be honest and
i hope i'm not
telling any secrets of of of the uh
of the left and the democrat um folks
but
we're we're still on the laughing stage
yes we're still we're still at the
laughs don't rush our process
right exactly give us a little bit of
time here
the most the test of your effectiveness
is
is she saying i thought she was gonna go
like the idea
me a person of color saying that hitler
was was great
no it's she's talking about i flew 30
hours
laughed at me and now they are fighting
me at every turn they're going to try
this ridiculous thing the most the test
of your effectiveness
let's get to the point here this
business with hitler
and nationalism uh there's you are a
number one target or among the number
one targets for media matters for all
the left-wing advocacy groups
uh they're going to try to kill you uh
figuratively
speaking 30 hours no doubt you
straighten out this thing with hitler
and
nationalism real quick if you would the
discussion was about nationalism and
whether it's okay for conservatives to
say that they are nationalists and what
i said
is that the word nationalism is wrongly
attributed to hitler because he was not
a nationalist
he was not focused on on trying to bring
the germans to a better state because he
was actively killing
german jews he was also trying to ex
you know the lat with the last time we
talked about this it was like she really
needs a remedial history course but
uh she really needs a remedial history
course
the uh the idea for hitler
was that he was trying to make germany
great again
uh to borrow a phrase no he did say that
i i flew to borrow a phrase from him i
guess i flew
30 hours and boy do i have positive
feelings towards hitler
and it's just that uh one of the ways
that he he went about it one of the
uh the not the only one i mean he wanted
to
increase the industrialization and there
was a lot of other imperialism
yeah one of the ways was to get rid of
those who were uh diluting the german
culture
according to him the they were almost if
you would call it like
aliens uh for for as far as he was
concerned
uh uh illicit aliens almost
and it didn't start documenting as we're
gonna kill the jews
it was like oh we're just going to put
them back where they belong
elsewhere they had a lot of notice
they were deporting them they just
couldn't find places to go but you see
they had multiple solutions and then
the one where they started to kill the
jews
was the last or the final solution if
you will
let's hear it maybe she salvages this
nationalism is wrongly
attributed to hitler because he was not
a nationalist he was not focused on
on trying to bring the germans to a
better state because he was actively
killing
german jews he was also trying to expand
and he was an imperialist
he was a homicidal maniac and we need to
stop associating nationalism
with two of the most uh two of the
evilest
uh figures in people in history evil uh
so have you learned a lesson here let me
just care about yeah
this in this business it's a very simple
thing the news business
anybody who ring brings up hitler loses
every single i've learned that okay so
when you look for a metaphor
take it from the old guy find another
metaphor
find another symbol another symbol i i
will totally
totally take that advice i've learned my
lesson well it's it's
yeah and you are because you are such a
target you have to be
keenly aware at all extra careful and
you walk
and and enough said
let's turn to virginia and lou do i want
to hear that part
and then lou dobbs is all right trust me
i would try to explain that hitler
wasn't that bad for a long time
young lady that was it's a tough road oh
you know uh media matters that come
after you every day
what's what's shocking about that was
was lou dobbs
basically tease up the what are your
thoughts about that
in other words i know your people have
told me that you want to explain this
you probably have something prepared so
i'm not even going to ask you a question
other than time for you to speak and uh
and justify your words and she still
she still steps in it again almost in
the i would like to clarify exactly what
i was saying which was that hitler great
domestic policy
overly aggressive foreign policy thank
you wow well
yeah that was a little rough stalin was
stalin was also bad but uh let me just
be clear here don't don't
it's tough you talk about how good
hitler was off the record
i'd like to see inside the chat at tpusa
right
now they're probably like oh so we're
saying the holocaust did happen
okay right exactly no the chat is
guys can you please stop saying the
holocaust didn't happen so much
we've already seen that chat don't be so
freaking over oh that's right
yeah there was literally seen that
um
exchanges from tp u.s a
in like their their florida chapter like
hey if we're gonna use this slack
channel
stop saying like you know the jews are
bad for no reason
yeah only when they deserve it yeah you
know guys we're trying to be a serious
organization and you're going to need to
say that the jews are global blood
suckers when it's part of it just avoid
saying the n-word and don't reference
richard spencer too much and don't you
hate
just cause all the time
you gotta have a reason for it where's
the lie the first alive first
lie it's just trying to make germany
great again
thanks for having me on lou uh really
innovative in domestic policy but
actually kind of
jewy in foreign policy thank you i'll
see you next week on the a block
