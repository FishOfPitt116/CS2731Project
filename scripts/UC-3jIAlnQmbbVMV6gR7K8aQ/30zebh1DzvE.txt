[Music]
we're going to go in the second half on
some of the specific histories of el
salvador and guatemala
but i we just want to sort of give you a
teaser in this opening segment here
because first here's elan omar
and i just got to say i did an analysis
of it
people should check out at the michael
brook show youtube page on the freak out
about her israel statements and
you know i think there's actually
subtleties and nuances to get into here
including a critique of outrage culture
frankly uh
as well as also the fact that uh
everybody can you know
improve god's working on all of us as
jesus and marrow say
uh but the bottom line is on the
substance of
israel as a policy question she is a
hundred percent right in terms of the
abuse of palestinians
and she has also been a target of
right-wing political terrorism including
from fellow members of congress and now
of course
uh the idiot dope bigoted in chief
president
the fact that she would have the hutzbah
and i will teach her that if she doesn't
know that yiddish word yet
the hutzpah to come out and just
give this pure uh
moral clarity and acuity and that
exchange with the disgusting grotesque
eliot abrams i mean people should
go hit her with a campaign contribution
i mean this is just
incredibly impressive leadership elan
omar
is a hero and i also enjoyed this
because
um look she released the statement it
was actually a great statement she
pulled off an incredible synthesis
of expressing sensitivity to where
people had felt she had gone wrong
and also reaffirming her commitment to
working on the underlying issue which
he's 100 right about with regards to
democracy for all in the middle east cnn
uh is still trying to make a a a a an
issue of it and uh
she was confronted uh walking the halls
of congress by
manu raju and instead of saying like hey
um
have you always cared so passionately
about the genocide in guatemala which
elliott abrams supported the cover-ups
of the mass rapes and beheadings of
toddlers in el salvador which he
supported and covered up
uh that how was it how
how about the blowback from a bunch of
people who apparently think
you know having coffee in a think-tank
boardroom is more important than
genocide
what about that no they go back to this
already dead story
that the political right is trying to
make hay of and
she shows that she uh aoc is not the
only one that knows how to handle
public nuisances our own manu raju found
her quite
unwilling to discuss the controversy
sorry
just as always jake tapper shot jake
daper jake pepper on brand
you're uh pestering a muslim pestering a
muslim with his concern
like this piety nonsense of jake tapper
just shut up all right go ahead
discuss the controversy when he asked
her about it today
i'm asking you a question about your
tweet you had a tweet saying the
president
i yes i tweeted there's a response you
can run that and have a nice day
they leave out the critical part where
he's asking her about
trump's tweet in response to her
response
what about your tweet though what about
your tweet to my tweet
what about that's no not your original
tweet what about your reply to what
about your apply to eat
which got ratioed actually didn't it all
get ratioed at one but
but great crack reporting instead of
you know go back and read manufacturing
consent by noam chomsky
there's no doubt that the you know
corporate press has of course
always been uh you know a cow towed to
the u.s foreign policy establishment
but like we're still going to play a
throwback clip of the in 1980s of peter
jennings talking about
the mass murder that the reagan
administration backed in el salvador
and in 2019 cnn is like you know what
don't even worry about the guatemala
genocide stuff let's go
try to talk about her twitter drama with
trump
pathetic uh speaking you said give money
to ilhan yes indeed jesse kelly here
uh if you want to put that up brandon
who's apparently i think a republican
uh what does he say here uh the jesse
kelly he's the kid
he's the guy who was really upset that
his kid was doing a robotics competition
he was talking about getting drunk all
weekend embarrassed by his son
who does robotics my son's a nerd
so jesse says republicans should be
pouring money into ilhon omar's
re-election campaign
if you're a republican and you wanted to
plant a destructive parasite i mean
that's some interesting language there
that's i was gonna say that's an
interesting
uh and actually if you think of well
this doesn't apply because she's muslim
she's not arab but
if we expanded semite to include arabs
at least
uh the phrase parasite in relation to
any semitic people
i'm gonna say pretty strong not good not
skillful what exactly would you be doing
differently than uh
what she's doing it's glorious i'm
donating please republicans
please please donate to ilhan omar you
are totally right actually as a matter
of fact you're owning the libs
yes every time a republican donates
money to
elon omar a uh
i don't know a trans uh gender uh equal
civil rights bathroom is closed or
something i don't know
we cry liberal tears don't do it
oh no please republicans don't send
money to ellen omar or a unisex bathroom
will be uh segregated again
yeah oh no please don't
i guess it probably is pretty easy to do
reverse psychology in these idiots but
no i mean
don't don't listen to jesse kelly oh no
if you're a republican don't contribute
money to illinois
