this is pretty funny you saw this on
twitter don't know who posted this but
um
just to give you a sense of just the
incredible hypocrisy
that is uh the republican party is
just through and through
there there is i'm sorry you know and i
and i saw the other night
uh steve schmidt sort of fell asleep in
the middle of it because i'm just
so exhausted but but uh steve schmidt
was on haze and he had him on there for
quite a while
steve schmidt really sort of went all in
as it were
on the uh republican party and there's a
couple of these people
who i think
i could take a cynical and jaded look at
they they realize like
they can't go any further with the party
and so they might as well go you know
as far away as they can others may have
had some
you know uh about of uh you know
late-stage conscience um
you know i've said in the past that i am
fairly impressed with jennifer rubin's
wholesale
retreat from republicanism
there are others i'm a little more
skeptical of some
who i feel like okay you know a guy like
max
boot uh he seems to be quite sincere but
i think you should take it to the next
step
and you know recede from public life
i mean honestly like i don't think you
should be sent to uh you know
to uh the gulag or you know sent to the
siberia or the or the western front or
something like that but i think that
um fallujah if you if you
have spent the better part of your
professional career
doing um stuff that you now realize
was heinous
what you got to do on the other end has
got to be pretty
extreme um
to make up for that and i think you've
got to sideline yourself for a while
until you've really worked out i mean
there's just
you know look people can do what they're
gonna do i'm not you know but this is
just my opinion i suggested on tmbs that
they publish all of their emails they
had with republicans when they were
republicans just for public
perusal that's a good idea that's a good
starting point i mean there's definitely
there i
i my sense is like you just it's not
enough
to write a couple of of uh pieces or
even publish a book
that you're going to profit on for your
reversal i think you got to do a lot
more
or just say like i'm hanging up my
gloves
i was fighting on the wrong side for too
long and there's nothing i'm going to do
that's going to make up for this so
i'm going to sideline myself nikki haley
came out with a tweet
and this is pretty stunning because
this is like a triple lindy as i try and
work through
the um sort of the machinations here
she writes i've struggled with what
happened in pittsburgh because it's so
similar to what happened
in charleston is he writing or
charlottesville
charleston charleston south carolina
right and um she's referring to
uh the dylan roof shooting in the
black church and she was governor at the
time
she says the country was very racially
divided at the time
at the time not anymore exactly
it was a couple years ago the country
was very was was really racially divided
town not so much now
we've been cleaning that up we've been
cleaning we didn't once
blame president obama
of course president obama the idea i
want you to contemplate this
we did not blame president obama for
dylann roof going in and shooting up
people in a black church
i don't know how i don't know how you
can construct that sentence
like and be conscious it's not as
possible she's like she's super drunk
when she's tweeting this it's 10 30 at
night
maybe she had taken an ambien had a
couple of glasses of wine i'm just
thinking of myself here
but how do you even construct a sentence
that says
we did not blame the black president for
the black people to be shot by the white
supremacist
yeah that's so generous of her it's
really generous magnanimous
it's super generous actually obama will
be the first one to say thank you nicky
right we focus solely on the lives lost
and their families
have some respect for these families and
stop the blame
so here's nikki haley out there
giving cover for donald trump and having
and bending over
so backwards to do so that she actually
offers as a um
as an analogy the idea of
an african-american president not being
responsible
for what a white supremacist does
then the added touch of of
i don't know is this uh symmetry or if
this is i don't know i don't know how to
articulate this but from
june of 2016
which was i think just before
maybe trump got the nomination but it
was pretty clear
he was going to at that point the hill
reports
nikki haley links trump's rhetoric
to charleston church shooting
so whatever
i'm gonna be i'm gonna give you the
really generous take the generous take
was
that nikki haley had a modicum
of self-respect and integrity as late as
june of 2016
and she completely sold that down the
river
to join this guy's administration
whom she said in some way may have
inspired
a white supremacist shooting up a black
church
joined his administration and then
leaves and still providing him cover
in almost an identical situation
there's a more jaded perspective that
she never had any integrity
whatsoever and she just found it at the
time
she was trying to position herself as
actually giving a crap about this
in a certain sense that statement made
you more valuable to joining my
administration
in a way when you were pretending that
you had integrity that was even
better for when you joined my
administration that was actually
you see how that worked what i really
wanted you that was unbelievable
check out michael wilson that's also why
jeff flake is valuable that's why jeff
flake's valuable that's why
nicki and i are so close haley said at
the time
she said i know what rhetoric can do i
saw it happen
exactly and she said about trump i will
not stop until we fight that man that
chooses not to disavow the kkk
this is not part of our country this is
not who we want as president
we will not allow that in our country
well
oh wait a second all right my mistake
cause i'm reading in that hill report
and it says she had her fingers crossed
holding her fingers crossed behind her
back we need to train journalists to
look for that better
yes god but it's written right there it
should be
it should have been so obvious to people
yeah um
but let's move on there uh good for
pittsburgh
um and now because of these protests
there's gonna be even more violence
it's really unfair the fact that she
still feels the need to align herself
with trump in this way
does not bode well for the future
they're all betting on trump
the well they're all betting on
the base that is
so trump uh like yeah
she knows when she does that she's
basically saying like i realize who i'm
gonna rely on to make me
president someday and i cannot in
any way criticize those people
