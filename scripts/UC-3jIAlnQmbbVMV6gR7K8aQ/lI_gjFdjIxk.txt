in the past
um the um
you know i was watching that uh that uh
ben shapiro uh clip of when he was on
bbc and aside from the sort of
incredible beauty of him uh
refusing to justify his positions and
claiming that
someone maybe arguably to the right of
him at least in terms of like
um sort of like principled conservatism
uh old school classic conservatism uh
claiming that that guy was a uh radical
lefty
um it was interesting you know now of
course
i have never been one who has bemoaned
the lack of civility in our political
discourse i think that's actually a
silly thing to um
to cry about i think that's something
you do when you
don't like the fact that people are
actually making you account for your own
positions and that is a safe
refuge that's basically what the uh
and you know for conservatives agreement
is the
fundamental bedrock of their project
and so you get things like the
intellectual dark web we
we can only exist in the dark web
despite the fact that we are in the
exact same web as everybody
else but don't scrutinize this web right
the
it's it really is yes it's the
um yeah the the um
intellectual don't scrutinize us uh web
is what what they really want to be in
uh but
shapiro was being accused of hypocrisy i
think
because he wrote a book
bemoaning the the crass nature and the
polarization of our politics because of
the um because of the bad faith of
different actors in there and then the
guy
you know said well your your youtube
videos are all
ben shapiro destroys this and destroys
that and
shapiro's response was of course the
well-reasoned response of
i don't title them and which you know
i understand that i don't title our
videos i
only know what maybe a small percentage
of them
are titled but the real response
really should be and the honest response
is
this is the medium the nature of the
youtube medium
is that you need to have
sensationalistic titles
to work the algorithm to get the videos
seen
now the content themselves that's a
different story
um and i don't um
i don't think that excuse works in terms
of the content
the titling i think is um much more
benign
ultimately than the content and um
and so and certainly i think um our
titles
are similar now i've never written a
book saying that we need to have a
decorum and
in pleasantry in political discourse i
don't i don't i don't uh think that is a
value we should pursue frankly
uh i'm just i don't i don't care um
i don't think that we're you know we're
not this
this is not bean bag but
um the reason why and frankly you know
for a long time
i was very resistant to do things like
optimize
or to allow you know hire people to
optimize our videos in terms of the
titling because i thought it was
sort of base the fact is
is that not only is it that a
requirement of the medium
but the medium is increasingly becoming
the way in which young people get their
politics
and so
if we want to influence future
generations
we need to speak to them because we are
facing and i don't want to see bill nye
i want to see the
the this is number 13. um
there's a story in buzzfeed about a
13 year old girl who is
a i think you could describe her as
alt-right
she is a red-pilling
right-winger she works with
a collaborator we don't know who that
collaborator is it's quite clear
they are writing uh her scripts with her
um and
her youtube name is soph
it's really not so much about her per se
she she has a
she's um she
ids sometimes as a joke as like an fbi
agent i guess in certain times i mean
you can check out her website um
but there's two stories this one and i'm
reading a story about uh
in the washingtonian about a 13 year old
who
um joined the alt-right
gone on to 4chan was feeling um isolated
from his friends
had gone through had been punished at a
private school i think this happens
quite a bit in private schools
because the private schools are
self-conscious about their lack of
diversity either racially
or um in terms of economics that has
been my
my observation in terms of like a lot of
private schools in
in new york city i mean i don't have a
kid who goes there but i
i know people who go there and i read
about them
and um i think
at times they become hyper sensitive
to any possible offenses and kids get in
trouble
for things that at like you know a
public school where there's some measure
of
of of socio-economic diversity
they're just like it's just a it's just
a problem that you have with kids
and they just deal with it in that way
um
this 13 year old who the i guess it's a
mom
wrote about um
he joined the alt-right got isolated
had a fallout with the people at school
got on 4chan
got on some reddit uh subreddit threads
and became an alt writer
i don't know what the story is with this
14 year old girl but this is where
you know this is the kind of information
kids are getting she's doing videos
that are just um do we have the uh like
the the simple video
that first one where she's just like um
you know videos like that that any
normal 12 year old would do
all part of her channel and uh she
started out as just sort of like i think
you know a benign
um youtuber maybe
i i don't know if i would put my kid on
for at uh
12 but um
twit not twitch but like stream dvd
video games
all right well do we have that um find
uh because i want to show an example
first of where where she started
um yeah here it is okay this is her
talking about halloween
rather than that and everybody at the
table agreed with the main couple of
people that are just
picking at picking at those around the
room i mean
sheeple seriously you're just going
along with that not really thinking
about huh
that's kind of up oh yeah and
also some people usually
now she's using uh you know a fairly uh
um
you know explicit language uh for a 12
year old although i have a feeling my
daughter uses same language when i'm not
around
but she's complaining about people's uh
you know like costumes at
school during halloween and uh
but she's grown into something uh much
more now uh here she is
um she's picked up like some video from
like a dr
phil episode about um
a black mom and her kid and whatnot uh
no let's go
back into the middle we had picked out
some times i thought but
uh yeah right there just go pick it up
there you could hear some of this
uh go ahead that's all you have to offer
limits itself to this
oh that's just awful yeah of course
that's just
that's just awful i'm not surprised she
sought orientation elsewhere
finger wagging isn't a productive means
of communication
my daughter does spend a lot of time on
social media i don't even look at her
facebook page it's too painful
now this is the story of a um of a
mother um whose kid
is uh is uh
become like critical of black people and
they're both
they're both black the mother and the
daughter but this is on dr phil it's one
of those sort of sensationalized
stories but she is commenting on you
know why
the um
why the uh the kid is right in her
critique of black people
but it's good speech so if treasures
post didn't get her banned they weren't
as bad as her mother made them out to be
if a facebook page is too painful for
her
someone should show her poll and watch
her go into a permanent coma as
a parent i kept expecting her to just
outgrow it and thinking she would change
i i pretty much was like an ostrich
put my head in the sand and it's getting
worse i bet this is what jeffrey
dahmer's mother thought too
before he started melting people in
vat's acid can't say i'm surprised
my expectations of this woman's
parenting skills weren't very high
judging by her out to lunch demeanor how
she remembers to wipe is beyond me
i'm interested in doing this story
because i think it's a teachable moment
and
not for sensationalistic shock value
because of some of the outrageous things
that she says
so i don't think she's doing them to get
attention i think she's doing because
this is how she actually feels and
believes
would you agree yes i do she says she's
white right
from a very early age this might be the
only accurate assessment in the entire
video
what i don't get is if they know that
she actually means what she says
why do they act so dismissively towards
her my guess is that they're too busy
morally grandstanding about it
to actually have a discussion with her
about her mindset that might just be a
lack of comprehension on their part
though
i'd wager that the majority of people
who recognize racism to be wrong
haven't ever formulated a proper
explanation as to why they think so
i'm not saying everyone has to have a
profound understanding of everything
but if these vultures are going out of
their way to bother this girl
they should at least articulate their
reason for doing so
there you go people don't have proper
understanding about uh what uh racism is
according to her
that or why why it's wrong i mean it
goes on there's other stuff
she has done videos about
muslim rape gangs and social justice
homos
and the evils wrought by george soros
um she has said uh stuff
um she's done so-called comedy videos
i've become a devout follower of the
prophet muhammad suffice to say
i have having a f a ton of fun of course
i get raped by my 40 year old husband
every so often i have to worship a black
cube to indirectly please an ancient
canaanite god but at least i get to go
to san francisco
and stone the out of some gays
according to her and the cops can't do
anything about it because california is
a crypto caliphate
these are the type of videos that she's
doing um she does
um she does some of the classic
cernovich pedo videos
in uh hollywood uh she does um
misanthropic uh videos all uh
reminiscent of 4chan
posts um she um
she apparently on her uh discord channel
is even
more uh hateful um and
uh the bottom line is you know she's
getting uh she has 800 000
subscribers to her channel report the
channel uh
she has a couple hundred thousand views
per video at least
um she has attempted to challenge uh
youtube to ban her but uh apparently
they
they're nervous about doing it um this
is
you know we've seen versions of this in
the past
you know uh jonathan crone we had on
this program um
uh you know i think about 2012 i think
it was maybe or
so and he was a kid that would that
marin and i had talked about it
air america years before uh but this is
uh of a different order and there is a
there's a whole new technological uh
platform for people like this and it's
very disturbing
and and frankly this is you know why we
do the youtube stuff
is to get in there and to um
to in some ways mitigate the messages
these kids are getting
and um you know i i don't know that
we alone can compete and you know the
dozen or so people in this space i don't
know that they can compete but
uh we try i mean youtube demonetized uh
sargon of akkad's channel over the
weekend they should definitely
you know at least demonetize if not just
disable this channel
we'll see um
i mean it is up to uh youtube and
advertisers if they want to be
associated with this stuff that's all
i mean look the there are advertisers
who come to us
that i say i don't want because i don't
want to be associated with them
there are advertisers who look at my
program and say
why don't want to advertise with him
that won't be associated with the
you know left-wing proposals or politics
or whatever it is
it's perfectly legitimate in my mind i
mean i don't know
um i mean i i think uh
you know these companies uh can be um
uh pressured i think that's a very good
case for breaking them up
into smaller entities so that um there
can be
you know gab you can go on gab
instead of twitter and uh let your um
you know your right wing freak flag fly
as it were
um but in
areas that are you know
we have laws in this country uh that uh
say that you know if you're
you're selling pornography on the street
you know uh the uh
magazines you can't you can't put them
you can't display them in such a way
that people on the street can easily see
it
and i think that's legit who's your
comrade
on
