le let's just start first why don't you
tell us just a little bit about the uh
holocaust and humanity
senator center um which i know is is
part of
uh the museum center in cincinnati uh
but tell us just a little bit about that
because there's a there's a couple of of
of concepts that you um you i guess
uh highlight in the in that museum that
i
that i think is is relevant to this
discussion
sure so the holocaust humanities center
here in cincinnati was
founded about 20 years ago by holocaust
survivors in our
in in this region but similar to
centers and museums around the country
it was done because survivors wanted to
ensure that not only
their stories and the history would be
preserved but the lessons of the
holocaust and so
the survivors in our community many
years ago said you know we want our
we want our stories to be a warning for
the future and so we've really taken
that to heart
in the new museum that just opened a
month ago
here in cincinnati and and even reflects
our name the holocaust and humanity
center which
is both about certainly teaching what
happened during the holocaust and how it
happened
how um individuals made choices
um and and which ultimately led to
um the atrocities that that we now know
a lot about
um but we're also committed to
allowing the past to help us think about
the lessons for today and so
we also have a humanity gallery which
focuses on
um instead of you know looking back and
saying
what would i have done or what could we
have done let's look forward and say
what can we do now how can we be an
upstander how can we make a difference
today on the issues that matter okay and
so you know with that with that said and
and i want to get into because we you
know some incredible
um incredibly disturbing stories about
um uh just in the past week about
the the the rise of of things like white
nationalism and white supremacy and hate
groups
um and before we get into uh the
to a couple of those stories whether
it's you know obviously this domestic
terrorist that was um
was caught or uh reports from the
southern poverty law center
um this this concept of upstanding
versus bystanding what what is
explain that to us yeah so you know for
so long
um in in particular in holocaust
education i think other realms
we've talked about one of the lessons is
don't be a bystander you know
that that hate and and justice and so
many horrible things happen because
um people are standing by right if we
always think if more people would have
um stood up or spoken up or
resisted in some way that perhaps the
outcome could be different
and so um what we learned is is people
in the past actually did stand up so
there are remarkable stories of
individuals not only who
which we certainly know about hid jews
but also resisted the nazis in various
ways and so
we're taking that concept so that
concept
of upstanding that you know there are
ways to make a difference and not be a
bystander
um whether that's um speaking out
whether that's creating some
response that it takes different forms
and ways you know we're not all
going to um respond in the same way but
we all have the potential within us
in our own unique ways we all have you
know unique
strengths and contributions we can make
to the world um that we can make a
difference and so this idea that
um all of us have the responsibility to
as we learn from the holocaust to not
stand by to not be bystanders
so if we say don't be a bystander what
is what what are we saying
what we're hoping we say is instead
let's be upstanders
when we see hate speech when we hear a
joke when we
um see horrific things happening whether
it's in our community our country our
world
that we have a responsibility to to
stand up and to do something
i mean what are the factors that that
distinguish i mean is it simply
there were different people had um you
know i guess
uh one degree or a greater degree of
character
the moral character than others or or i
mean are there
contextual factors that make it more
or less likely that a certain individual
will
um will will intercede i mean you know
we have examples um just in the past
two years of things like you know the
the muslim ban comes to mind where all
of a sudden you know people mobilized
immediately and went to uh
airports um defending
uh people who they had no idea who they
were it was all
you know fundamentally based on what
they saw
was a step in the wrong direction for
society
so that's a great question and something
that many researchers including
psychologists and sociologists and
others have
tried to examine especially as it
relates to the holocaust so what is it
within you know the individuals who
stood up that made them do so
um in many ways it's actually been hard
to identify
in there are some similarities um
one the the people who are rescuers or
who stood up
often said you know i saw the humanity
in the other person i saw myself and the
other person i saw
or the other issue or situation um and i
could imagine it being me
um or in many cases people talk about
role models so there are people that
shaped them whether from the time they
were young or
adults um to think about the choices
they make and other human beings and
our responsibility um so you know there
are
some factors but you know there's not
true consensus i think
um one of the things that we're focusing
on in our exhibition
you mentioned character strengths we're
focusing on character strengths and this
concept that
all human beings have character
strengths we all have
there's actually character science about
um how it works and
psychologists who have studied this and
that it's
it takes practice for us to actually use
them
one of the things that that we found as
well is that
individuals who do one small act
are more likely to do more so even
historically we saw you know somebody
who uh perhaps a
a jewish somebody who was being
persecuted
came to nanju's house and said could i
spend the night and i said oh i'm really
nervous but yeah i'll let you spend the
night and then
it becomes a week and then it it grows
so
um same thing i think even today once
once you do a little bit um there's
opportunity to actually practice being
an upstander and
um learning how to use our character to
the best of our ability
uh that that's fascinating and then and
i i
i imagine on some level then the
idea of of of having people engage and
intercede
even in the smallest of yeah
of situations becomes like um
it's almost as if you're building some
type of immunity
that aggregates over time or grows on
itself
i think that's a hundred percent right
and actually i think
the small moments in some ways are where
it matters most
um because that's where we're
learning how to make a difference and
how to be upstanders and
um and modeling for others and you know
there's so many examples we we actually
have many
stories in our humanity gallery of where
individuals in a single moment have made
a choice
that's had an enormous ripple effect
that you know they never knew about
things like you know somebody working in
our at our city incinerator
and recognizing that there are our items
people are throwing out
that other other people could use and
need
and so he starts collecting them and
delivering them to the community
and it turns out to be our biggest um
really food pantry wrap around social
service organization now in our
community so
it's it's those small moments that that
matter
all right what's fascinating we've
talked about sort of the um i guess one
side
of the coin which is the way that
um uh the implications
of of good people doing something small
and good and uh but when we come back
let's talk a little bit about um
some of the bad people i hate to be this
reductionist but
uh when we talk about a um
a a potential uh domestic terrorist and
we talk about
the increase of hate groups in this
country um that's that's the flip side
of that coin
we got to take a a quick break we'll be
right back i'm sam cedar this is ring of
fire radio
we will be uh right back in just one
moment
