ladies and gentlemen
um oh let's just let's pick up a phone
call here here we go uh
oh i don't see
here we go come from 646 area code who's
this where you calling from
who is this me yeah
646. hi this is yup um
this is train boy from new york how are
you doing i'm doing great what's on your
mind
well um i just thought i'd call in and
share a story about how i
harassed laura loomer when she decided
to handcuff herself
to um the new york city twitter
headquarters door
last night so for those people who don't
know uh laura loomer
she is the um how would you describe her
the
uh right-wing provocateur uh
who got bumped from uh
twitter and she has made it um
it is almost like a human rights
violation from her perspective
that uh her human rights were violated
when she got bumped from twitter is that
an accurate
assessment of her um
she's pretty much indistinguishable from
tommy lauren except for the fact that
she's a
um laura loomer is a brunette and
apparently she's jewish
okay so she's a jewish nazi oh she's
also much less successful than tommy
lauren
is an outsider tommy's on the inside
okay so
uh with that said um let's hear i got an
analogy sorry
uh tommy uh um loomer is sort of like to
tell me lauren what
uh what james o'keefe is to ben shapiro
okay
so there we go so you saw uh laura
loomer and we will play video of this uh
soon uh but she was uh she
handcuffed herself to uh
the twitter entrance in new york city
and you
you did what so
the twitter office in new york it's
about
five ten minutes from my office and i
had um
a bit of down time so i decided to uh go
there and
see how she was holding up and um while
she was there
while i was there i i told her to go on
come town
oh that was you
wow that went somewhat viral
because i saw that laura loomer's rolls
she's like she's like are there
any nazis that want to date a highly
disturbed jewish girl
please i'm jewish i have severe
emotional and psychic
issues and i just want a skinhead now
why won't anyone help me and what did
she say she say she'd think about it she
had
like a was her pr person there or what
well she was too busy uh complaining
about
louis farrakhan who is apparently
relevant
uh louis farrakhan of course is the uh
the uh ceo of twitter
yeah and uh may i add
to this when i called jews
bloodsuckers i didn't do it on the
twitter
platform it's called terms of service
all right well i appreciate the update
we're going to play some video of her
now
one more thing before you let me go yeah
um
i took the liberty of buying the domain
name cedar for senate dot com
let's keep check out all right well uh
we know
the battle of the cucks we know where to
go uh for that we'll see
i'm not i'm not ruling it out um these
days i mean
i think after i give joe manchin the d
to my house
i will have seen off any potential
challenge from a progressive
i mean you know if nobody ran against
him
i'm you know somebody needs to run
against him yeah seriously so we're
we're we're somebody we're gonna rent
out sublet the office and we're all
going in
a camper van and uh do this
the the listening tour across new york
state
um all right so let's get down to brass
tacks
ladies and gentlemen uh laura loomer who
was last seen
uh where was she last seen she was last
seen um
like shoving alex jones out of the way
so that she could
um talk to jack dorsey after he had
testified
in front of congress uh jack dorsey did
not
get involved in a conversation with her
laura loomer
the right provocateur or almost would-be
provocateur some who have rumored to
have been a
paramour of mike cernovich um
i can't those nathan bernard's still
looking into that
he's still looking into that okay um and
uh yeah supplements it's so sexy
in the meantime she um she handcuffed
herself
to the twitter um headquarters
let's play the video uh it start where
does it start
this is this is just right when she's
handcuffing herself okay so she
handcuffed herself
i'll tell you the thing that i find um
sort of offensive here
and and and i will say that you know
around the time of pittsburgh people
uh started wearing i saw some people in
brooklyn wearing the yellow star
that was the um star that the nazis
uh made the jews wear uh to identify
them
as a way of reappropriating it uh laura
loomer
has here go to the beginning in this
video so we can watch
how it starts is this how it starts oh
this is not oh
oh i see okay and she's wearing a yellow
star
on her outfit and at first when i saw
this i was like you got to be effing
kidding me
and then i thought about it for a while
and i was like you got to be effing
kidding me
to equate yourself having been
kicked off of twitter to jews
who were ultimately taken to death camps
seems to me to uh lack
a certain perspective now it's possible
that there's something
deeply deeply wrong with laura loomer
uh which means that those people who are
enabling her
are are really responsible for this but
on the off chance that there is not
something deeply
deeply clinically wrong with her and
she's just an incredible narcissist
um we're gonna play this video and uh
and then mock it
here she is she has handcuffed herself
and here's a couple of
moments of that
laura why didn't you handcuff yourself
to both doors
why did so if you're just listening
we'll go back a little bit
if you're just listening it is a two
door
you know like there's two doors and
there's handles on both doors and she
only handcuffed herself onto one door
so she's not actually preventing anybody
from going in or out
it's just not as if like she's it's
almost like people who are looking for a
quarter and they open up the bank
uh like the bank atm door for you
she's there and trying to hand out a uh
a piece of paper with a jewish a yellow
jewish star
sewn onto her outfit all right continue
laura why didn't you handcuff yourself
to both doors
why did i handcuff myself why didn't you
they're still getting in and out well
i'm not trying to trap them inside the
building
you know that's a fire hazard of course
but the issue
here is that jack dorsey thinks that by
banning me as a jewish conservative
woman from pointing out jew hatred
i was defending women i was defending
gay people
i was defending jewish people from
bigotry and from hatred from homophobia
from anti-semitism and i got banned
do we have an example of maybe some of
the that
wonderful humanitarian defense that
laura loomer has
uh blessed us with on twitter back in
the day here's one
uh stefan molyneux uh writes
uh over 2 000 migrants have died
crossing the mediterranean so far this
year uh presumably these are um
are ones that are coming from uh syria
maybe
uh i don't know when this was uh this
uh this tweet was from and she wrote she
wrote good
period clap clap clap here's to 2 000
more
um i guess with the hopes that none of
those um
those migrants were um were
you know uh muslim muslim or
none of them were women because she's so
protective of women
et cetera et cetera um what else do we
have other examples of of laura loomer
uh spreading her goodness on twitter
yeah this is this is a nice one um she
wrote muslims are in full force
at the scene of the new york city isis
attack today rubbing it in everyone's uh
face aimlessly walking around in hijabs
uh there was two women who were wearing
uh
muslim headgear who were just probably
on the way to work
or uh somewhere else they were walking
um
laura loomer at one point uh was banned
from
uber and lyft after a uh
a tweet storm back in uh about a year
ago now
about um about uh
anti-muslim tweets that she was pushing
she wrote someone needs to create a
non-islamic form of uber or lyft because
i never want to support another islamic
immigrant driver jesus
i mean come on now a little warm fuzzy
there
no this is exactly what they were
struggling against in nazi germany
yes and and of course uh it is because
of her clear um her you know
jewishness that comes through in this
that is why she was banned
fan muslims date nazis there you go
it's a third way for judaism
unbelievable
yeah did she go home like did she get
tired and go home
so what happened did she pee her pants
as she had promised
oh is that what was going to happen she
was going to pee well tim
uh dubious reporter tim poole had
reported that she was
ready to to defecate and urinate
while handcuffed but i don't know if it
ever came to that but the other thing
the first thing i heard laura loomer was
i can't remember if this was like
charleston or some sort of white
nationalistic protest and she said
someone just slashed my tire i'm
honestly speechless one week after
someone doxed me and it was clearly just
tire rot right
it was pointed out that her tire uh like
which have
almost no treads uh broke
uh not a slap apparently if you guys
want it this is also another instance
of a fascist all of a sudden realizing
that
because these platforms have so much
power over our lives and because in fact
in the long term this could
uh well it poses an immediate concern to
them because they get kicked off the
platform for being disgusting and all of
a sudden uh
we need to nationalize it so that free
speech is protected apparently laura
loomer
i sent you the sound if you want it said
just that the other day too
amidst her uh her rants you know it's
interesting
the the d platformer now laura loomer um
i don't know was that uh
big of a a pundit in any way she's
definitely trying to
um uh build her brand but
it is interesting to note now with some
time
the implications of de-platforming some
of these people
uh alex jones is not i mean he may be
doing the same sort of toxicity but he
is not
part of the national conversation in the
way that he used to be
um does anybody remember baked alaska
right i mean these are our figures who
were toxic
figures in our society they have been
de-platformed on these commercial
platforms and
um it's very hard to say
now uh i i tend to agree that
their social media has become ubiquitous
enough that
uh we need to take we need to take steps
to uh change the dynamic i don't know if
that is
we nationalize uh google
we nationalize things like facebook
or if we as a
as a government say okay we're going to
now break you up like we did
uh the telephone companies back in the
day and we're going to offer the
opportunity for people to have real
competition
here uh i'm not sure frankly i haven't
uh contemplated either uh
solution as being the more optimal
or desired but something clearly needs
to be done
because of the process now with that
said
the value of d platforming i think is
pretty clear
yep well here's what i think ask i think
here's what i think i mean i i do think
in the long term
and i do support nationalization that
you these are so ubiquitous and such a
major part of how we communicate
that fundamentally we do i want to
absorb them under
uh those first amendment protections for
everybody but in the short term until
that happens
uh cool right like it's not the scenario
right now so if there's a benefit
from eliminating some toxicity in the
world we're in
which points to potentially bigger
problems because on the flip side i
think
you know facebook having the atlantic
council monitor
their you know some of their content is
absolutely implicating
legitimate outlets that cover latin
america as an example so there's big
problems there but
if you're gonna de-platform uh i like
these choices yeah certainly i'm not
gonna shed any tears over nazis being
de-platformed from
uh social media platforms and whatever
is going to happen like people make the
argument that oh if they could deep
if they can do it to the right then they
can do it to the left they can
whatever's going to happen to the left
is going to happen to the left
independently of what happens to the
right
so we got to use all the tools in our
toolbox and and
and i'm i'm i mean i my point i just
want to be clear on what my point is
is that it is there's some question as
to whether or not
the flap deplatforming works
so putting aside the question of whether
it's desirable for just a moment
it clearly works right like the
the idea of like because i've heard
people in the past who say when you
de-platform people
makes them a martyr it makes them a
martyr and they become a
bigger but it clearly works now that may
be because of the problem that we have
with the size of these platforms
that's yes yeah okay but i'm just saying
i'm just addressing that narrow
question that we all have we now have
the time
to uh assess whether deplatforming works
or hurts if you are trying to fight back
or if you are you know hoping for a
certain voice to be diminished
and uh it clearly works
i also on a tangent point imagine being
so demented that in a world of like
nelson mandela
and lula people like that that you call
laura loomer a martyr
yeah that's incredible um i just want to
just
shout out myself back in december 2016.
i said
this is before the book was canceled uh
i i said uh i think it'd be hilarious if
milo's book was canceled and
and am unafraid of him becoming a martyr
as he is largely talentless
there you go i'm very good at
predictions yes matt leck ahead
of the game another first modicum
achievements prediction uh tweet modicum
for uh matt lick but
here's the bottom line ski uh lord
loomer is jewish
there's actually an interesting article
in jacobin by benjamin
f y fong right now called log off it's
sort of uh wrestles with the idea of
whether social media is even a good idea
at
all in the first place and whether it
should be like nationalized and put
under democratic control
as we move to a more social society or
whether we should all just decide for
the good of society
to get rid of it that seems unlikely to
me i don't know who
all but um it would need to be like
statutory but i think if we're exploring
if a law got passed like today that was
like facebook just can't exist
like no no breaking up of it you're just
done that's just not existent anymore
i think that everybody would get over it
and actually feel pretty happy in like
two weeks
life would if you especially if you want
i mean if you wanted to narrow it to one
platform
world better off without facebook would
be the easiest
pure net positive yeah yep
