should we play one clip of
o'reilly sure um
we've got a clip of o'reilly in his
basement complaining about sensitivity
training at michigan state
or o'reilly freaking out about soros
which one do you i like him freaking out
i like i like him
all right this is the one about o'reilly
this is
o'reilly's defense right
after it turns out that soros was
the target of essentially
an attempt to bomb him to death
here is bill o'reilly remember bill
o'reilly
was one of the pioneers in demonizing
soros
and he's gonna i didn't know that even i
didn't even oh yeah back in the day
back when he was like talking like i
went up to um
to harlem and eight and you didn't hear
anybody say mofo this or mofo passed the
grits
any of that it was all normal and
what a great guy right jason silverstein
what a great guy
financially sports democracy and human
rights cause he's he's reading off of a
a piece about soros and he's really
upset he's steamed what a great guy
financially sports democracy and human
rights causes more than a hundred
countries ah
this is what i mean you can't trust a
war
now no mention
that soros was convicted of a felony in
france
posit he was convicted of insider
trading was that what it was
in france he's got the century book
sam don't mess with him he's got the
century he knows it all from last
century but that's last century
okay no mention
that hungary the country of hungary
usually passed a law
against him intruding in their internal
politics
didn't mention it pause it for a second
now there's a hungary is a right-wing
nazi dictatorship isn't it it is uh
full-on
fascist these days and they they don't
like the jews
you know uh there's a long history
uh gorka is a little um a badge of ratzy
or whatever that is
is all about uh hungary's um
passing laws about the jews
country of hungary recently passed a law
against him
intruding in their internal politics
didn't mention it
i guess jason didn't no yeah yeah you
know oh
that makes me furious cbs
go back so here is
his bill o'reilly's attempting to sort
of
to knock sorrow so this is the way this
is this is the way he tears apart this
uh this piece
no
mention it i guess jason didn't no
yeah yeah you know ah
makes me furious cbs news
all right and then he writes a bit uh
down
um this is a great show but the soros
scorn hit a fever pitch in the early
2000s once he became more involved in
american politics
specifically opposing george w bush he
compared the bush administration to the
nazi and communist regimes
saying bush had improved on the
techniques of governing by fear
and soros spent more than 27 million on
successfully opposing bush's 2004
re-election
okay so this this guy soros he's he's a
hero
he's sporting democracy
trophy goes on the right quote
he doesn't have uh he just lays the
predicate he doesn't come back with the
other half of the sentence it's like
oh he's supporting democracy
and then he runs out of here he doesn't
have like uh he doesn't he doesn't have
a criticism
hey meanwhile soros the nazis in his own
country hate him
that's that's what they think of sorrow
they said to him the nazis in his own
country
said don't and interfere with our
politics
a hero sporting democracy
it's overseeing goes on to write quote
the conservative movement responded by
unleashing fury on soros and he became a
constant target for fox news and other
right-wing commentators
bill o'reilly ran a 10-minute segment on
soros calling him
an extremist and an off-the-chart
dangerous person
accusing him of funding propaganda and
manipulating liberal politics with his
fortune
absolutely true i did more than 10
minutes you pinhead
accumulation couple hours is absolutely
true
what i said okay okay propaganda
okay manipulating liberal politics
here's a proof
jason silva saying get a little pen
write this down
there you go okay i think david
pinhead he's bringing back pinhead i
don't think he's said that i mean i
haven't watched him a long time but i
think
he he stopped saying that on his uh fox
show maybe he said it more on his radio
program back in the day
because he found out it was an actual
condition because it wasn't actually
it's based on that's someone once told
me a lot of those words are actually
based on old things so they're
really more insulting than he knows wow
i had no idea
no but that's but i mean even the
lettermans use it but i just found out
all these things like imbecile
 they were all used i don't know if
you saw that
uh documentary about eugenics no but uh
yeah they all those words were all used
by this idiot who decided
that people were feeble-minded and uh i
don't want to bring us down though
