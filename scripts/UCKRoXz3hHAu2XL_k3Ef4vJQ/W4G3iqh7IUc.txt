Jesse these 16 charges were dropped by
the Chicago Police none of this makes a
lick of sense from either side the
official statement is shrug emoji they
say after reviewing all the facts and
circumstances of the case including mr.
smarts volunteer service in the
community what I think we should all
just be glad this is over I think both
sides need to go back to their
respective corners and shut up about it
Chicago PD needs to go back to framing
other black people for time and letting
cops off for murdering black people
that's that's what they do best and
Jesse can go back to you know sing in
his little ditties on Empire
I think the 25th reprise of you're so
beautiful is being written for them for
me
