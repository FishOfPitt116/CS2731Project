and we're back back with Alesia Megan
and Lewis for the rant wheel this week
on the wheel we have Amy Adams super
smash brothers the unfilled cheap stand
position motion smoothing on TV school
start times Gaga repeating herself
flying while black and romaine lettuce
to equal problems let's spin it it has
landed on romaine lettuce okay this
one's me ah
I just don't think we realized how much
we needed it like I
[Applause]
like what the has been going on you
walk into Trader Joe's and it's bare you
go into Chipotle and they're like we're
so sorry like we didn't even know our
country was built on romaine lettuce and
I've been experimenting
I've been trying I've been buttering
I've been a LaRue Galang and it's just
not the same it's horrible
truly ecoli makes the heart grow fonder
because now we realize how good we had
it and we need it to come back and I'm
so happy and god I'm so sad for those
people and I just want it crispy and
green and beautiful and back in those
bags
we took romaine for granted we thought
it would always be there until the day
it wasn't and we realized we never told
romaine we loved you the only holiday
people cook we just move removed a whole
like chunk of the pyramid and also it's
not like Americans were clamoring for
salad let's get to the dirty truth of it
there's a lot of people out there that
ask for a salad found out they couldn't
have one and we're like hell yeah by the
way there was a strand of people on
Twitter when this happened we're very
like well if you're eating romaine
you're the problem anyway it's like no
we eat romaine lettuce you like
you can't avoid it stop pretending
you're above fine light green Raj it's
not iceberg we're not animals let's spin
it again shut up it is landed on Lady
Gaga repeating herself
I did want to talk about this one
because how many of you people saw this
how many of you guys saw this we all did
everybody saw this video of Lady gaga
using the same anecdote again and again
and again and saying you know there were
a hundred people who told me no but
Bradley Cooper said yeah and she said it
a lot it was her thing she went to and
her thing she would turn to Bradley
Cooper and she would say with a great
fanfare and emotion and sincerity and a
maybe even a little little water in
those eyes I probably said this earlier
but there can be hundred people in a
room watching you in 99 and it can
change everything I would not be here
without you and it was as if it was the
first time she said it but it wasn't the
first time she said it it was the
thousands time she said it and people
were sharing this as if Lady gaga did
something wrong what kind of what kind
of greedy childish little cultural
creeps have we become
we demand these people politicians
Gaga's others do incredible amounts of
press in order to get in front of us in
our various siloed little memes I don't
watch it there I got my I get my news
about Gaga through a tiny box that
appears in one app so she's got a
 get herself into that goddamn
box I get my political news from an app
that that that searches Twitter for
topics that are my Facebook friends like
and that's where I get my news so Lady
Gaga's gotta get in that thing
too it's a lady Gaga now has to do what
you know Roosevelt got to do one
fireside chat Lady Gaga has got
to say the same a thousand times
Hillary Clinton has to say the same
thing a thousand times Barack Obama has
to say the same thing a thousand times
Donald Trump has say the same thing a
thousand times and so now our standard
is we want someone authentic a word we
use to stand in for integrity well what
is in thought then tick mean to us now
it means doing a great job at being
incredibly insincere
being so good at it you have to
be such a good actor so that you can
seem authentic that's what we this
content hungry little sugar
eating
monsters we've become to man from
everyone and the second we are exposed
to the thing we make them do the product
we demand the press and publicity we
need in our eyeballs before will
deign to buy a movie ticket or cast a
vote
we're offended how dare this person
repeat that soundbite that I need to
know was said just once just once for me
and so we allow this idea of
authenticity to stand in for integrity
meanwhile you know who's really good at
being authentic Donald Trump
he's great at putting on a show and
saying it like he's saying it for the
first time you people happy with that
you happy with it so give Lady Gaga
goddamn break
[Applause]
