so mike pence
wanted to reach out to the jewish
community
and he wanted to show
solidarity with those jews
who were shot killed 11 jews in
pittsburgh
at a synagogue who were shot because
they were jews
and what better to do that what better
way to do that
than to appear
with a rabbi who's
actually a christian see here's the big
difference
multicultural listen there's there's
there's there's a decent amount of
differences between jews and christians
huge but decent the primary one
is uh centered around
the christ figure that's where the
christian part of christian comes from
and that christ for christians
is the messiah and
in christian doctrine the messiah has
shown up
and culminated the
aspirations as articulated in what they
call the old testament
but here's the thing jews don't call
that the old testament
there's a reason why jews don't call it
the old testament
because for them it is still in effect
in other words the the christ figure
the messiah has not shown up yet
that's the difference to christianity
and uh judaism there's
other differences but that's the um the
big one
jews don't believe that jesus
jesus christ was in fact jesus christ
they just think they think it's fake
news they think
it is exaggerated news yeah he was a guy
jews think that he was a guy minor
prophet
not you know a man of prophet pretty
good
pretty good about his his banking stuff
was good
sort of like the elizabeth warren of the
jews
in a way but not
he's not christ he's not christ that's
why we're still
jews and you guys you might as well call
yourself christians
and so they did but then some people
decided well
i like the jewish tradition
and i think i'm going to be a different
section
christian i'm going to be a jew
for jesus is what they call themselves
and so mike pence
wanting to show his respect for these
jews who were
shot could apparently only find one
rabbi
who would show up at the same place as
him and that is
uh this guy he is
lauren jacobs he is the senior rabbi
of congregation shema israel
shema the shema is a probably one of the
most important prayers
it says there's only one god which cuts
a little bit against
the idea of christ but what he can do
and
they are in a northern suburb of detroit
they are a messianic
synagogue they believe that
jesus has already shown up and um
this guy if you have ever seen a
um a jews mourning or talking of the
dead
they say recite the kaddish maybe you've
seen that
sometimes it's uh depicted in popular
entertainment
uh yitkada of yitkadash that goes on
but it basically is a um
it talks about you know living your life
etc etc
and often what will happen is they will
name they will recite the names of the
dead
the people who have departed in this
instance
mike pence decided to switch it out with
this guy he got a christian rabbi
to bless the names
of republican candidates running for
office in the midterms
i pray that you would enable vice
president pence to continue to fulfill
his many and important responsibilities
with excellence
i pray for attorney general bill shooty
who's running for governor
for congressman mike bishop who is
running again for congress for lena
epstein who is running for
congress for john james who is running
for the senate
i pray for them and for the republican
party and its candidates
that they would honor you in your ways
that you might grant them victory
in this election that's sweet
there's nothing more than a partisan
invocation
as you are commemorating the deaths of
of your non-fellow jews
as a rabbi yeah that's sweet that's a
sweet homage
to those people who were violently
killed
these people are insane they're insane
i mean i you know
and and and to be clear look i don't
care
you want to be a jew for jesus be a jew
for jesus
you want to be a jew that's uh actually
a jew
be a jew that's actually a jew i don't
care
but to have a so-called rabbi go up
there
it is an offense
on some level to sort of portray this
guy as a jew
in this in this circumstance
and then to have him basically just pray
for
republican candidates it seems a little
tacky
it seems a little tacky
