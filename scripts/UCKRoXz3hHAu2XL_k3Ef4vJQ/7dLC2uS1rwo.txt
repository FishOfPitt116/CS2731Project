he's in governor of washington and a
democrat running for president
jay inslee governor thanks for being
here yeah a beautiful day to
to run for president aren't they all i
think we picked the right state
too that's right uh you were our first
ever you were the first ever positive
america live show guest when we were in
seattle is it true yeah
in early uh 2017. wow you guys owe your
tremendous success to me that
yeah that's what we tell everyone it was
all because of governor ensley
i wanted to start with the issue that
you've put at the center of your
campaign
climate change you have built yourself
as the climate change candidate you've
said that what distinguishes you from
other candidates is that this is going
to be the climate change campaign what
does that mean
in terms of how you're running your
campaign how are you different from
other candidates when it comes to
climate change
well number one i am the only candidate
who is saying
very specifically and unequivocally
that defeating climate change has to be
the number one priority of the united
states it has to be the first foremost
in paramount duty of the next president
and i firmly believe that i believe the
urgency of the moment
is uh unparalleled and actually in human
history
because we've got exactly one more
chance to turn this ship around
or our children and our grandchildren
are going to live very very degraded
existences
it is an existential threat that is not
an overstatement
the science is clear on this it is
accelerating it's now starting to touch
us where we live
it's burning down our towns like
paradise california where i visited it's
flooding
the midwest i was uh in in
hamburg iowa yesterday where town
it was an it's been there since 1858
never flooded before now it's been you
know virtually destroyed
uh we're having to raise our our roads
in the seacoast here in new hampshire
there you know they've got
sea coast issues so everywhere you go
you're learning that this is a beast
that has to be confronted
and and so uh we have to have a
president to do this
and i am saying unequivocally that it
has to be job one because it is not
job one it will not get done it takes
as you know enormous capital to
restructure your economy and that's
fundamentally what we're going to have
to do and so
that is a unique position to have said
that
it's also unique because i actually
believe it
it hasn't added it has an added benefit
because i truly believe this i've been
working on this for over 20 years
i co-authored a book about it in 2007
helped
fund the or start the us climate
alliance
a couple years ago and we now have 23
states in that regard
introduced legislation um you know in
2003. so this has been a longtime
pursuit of mine
and i think that i'm uniquely qualified
amongst the field to understand
from a policy perspective what really
needs to get done and the third
uniqueness and
there may be a theme in our discussion
is that uh instead of having just talked
about this i've actually done things
about it
and uh we've start you know we've
developed a huge wind industry
six billion dollar wind industry in our
state in park because of initiative i
worked on
we've built uh spin-off companies
because of my clean
energy development fund we are
electrifying our transportation system
now
we're going to have 50 000 electric cars
in the road here
fairly shortly we i just passed 100
uh clean uh electrical grid bill through
our house and i hope to sign that
shortly so that is unique having been an
executive and i have learned having
been a member of congress and an
executive that there is a difference
between
making speeches and actually figuring
out the mechanics and the hard
work to get something done so those are
three differences that make me unique i
think
what what is the inslee plan to deal
with climate change look like
well uh we will be rolling out a very
comprehensive
plan here in the in the weeks to come
but i'll give you just some a summary if
you will
bottom line is that we need to have a
clean energy economy in the next several
decades and that has to happen it is a
scientific necessity there is no doubt
about this
and the good news is we know we are
capable of doing this because we're
seeing the beginning of that
technological revolution we're seeing
wind turbines in
in iowa and by the way trump is wrong
wind turbines do not cause cancer they
cause
jobs okay this is about jobs
fundamentally
and uh it is important to say that
because
this is this is a unique moment
where you have two things happening at
the same time just at the right time
number one it's a matter of urgent peril
but it is
a matter of tremendous economic promise
so our plan is to build on economic
promise of clean energy jobs that are
now starting across the nation
uh we would have a multi-sectoral
approach where we basically go and look
at our economy
and and build new clean energy jobs to
to to build this uh this decarbonized
system
in transportation it means we need to
electrify our transportation system
which we are doing rapidly
both by uh some regulatory touch and
some incentives to help people finance
it it means building electric charging
stations up and down our
our roads which we're doing in
washington state it means
doing the r d that is necessary to
continue the development of batteries
that are so important
to the whole clean energy world uh so
you need to build a decarbonized
transportation system it means building
enormous infrastructure
because we know you know they can't
build a a bird house in washington dc
but we have 70 billion dollars of
infrastructure and transportation 70
of which is for public transportation
right now which is low carbon
so in their transportation system is a
dramatic reversal of the
huge carbon dioxide emissions that we
have now
we need a an enormous r d effort our
our research and development has been
pathetic in the past
we spent more money developing one kind
of jeep than the entire clean
energy system of the united states it
means
going going to a fossil free electrical
grid and as i
indicated we just passed a bill a couple
days ago that would have a hundred
percent electrical grid
uh moving fairly rapidly and we're
closing off our coal fire plants just in
the next
several years and throughout this uh
100 clean electrical grid millions of
jobs associated with building everything
from wind turbines to solar plants to
public transportation
uh an effort to finance this in part by
removing the enormous subsidies that
taxpayers are
are shackled with 27 billion dollars
right now go to the oil and gas
companies that needs that gravy train
needs to stop and throughout this
we need to embed the idea of a just
transition in a just transition means
you take care of the victims
frequently communities of poverty and
communities of color
to focus our efforts on the first
victims and
also help those who are in industries
that are going to transition
to do the things like we're doing in
centralia in our coal plant
which we have a 55 million dollar fund
to help the people during that
transition so that's a quick run through
the future so a couple questions on that
um
well you're recognizing that you're
going to roll the details later on but
do you see your plan as dramatically
different
slightly different as the green new deal
that has been proposed in congress
oh i think it's it's very much
consistent with the goals
of of this and by the way i think the
green new deal has been helpful it's
helpful because it's
got people talking about climate change
so that's good it's helpful because it's
raised people's ambitions as to the
scope of this
and has helped bring in more people
communities of color and those in
in all kinds of new communities who see
themselves part of this discussion so i
think it's been really helpful
but we all know including the drafters
of the green new deal we're going to
have to
all work together to develop the
policies to actually make it happen
and that's where i come in working with
other people to do that and we're going
to have these very specific proposals
and it'll be based on 20 years of work
this is not a
bumper sticker this is a lifetime
work of mine and i'm excited about
rolling it out so the politics of
climate change are
very difficult and they have been for a
long time um
you know in your state this past fall
there was a
carbon fee that was on the ballot you
worked very hard to try that get that
elected the state rejected it in some
places in
and defeated very handily in the rural
areas what did you learn from that
defeat that you would apply
to effort as a in an inslee
administration to
enact climate change legislation that
will require even if you get rid of the
filibuster someone like joe manchin
or other conservative democrats to vote
for it well number one
i learned that the look you're up
against the biggest special interest in
world history
the oil and gas companies put in 32
million dollars to defeat this
and as you know with 32 million dollars
you can you can blow a lot of smoke
and create a lot of uh uh discordant and
and
deceptive information and and that's
hard to beat at the ballot
i learned that that the most
important renewable energy source in
america
is is perseverance meaning you can't
give up you just got to go to plan b c
and d and that's what we're doing
and the good news is that we have
multiple avenues to
to defeat climate change it isn't just
one policy or your
or your toast there's all kinds of
policies and so what we're doing now is
we turned right around
and developed a policy uh a portfolio of
things that if i get them through my
legislature will have roughly the same
carbon
pollution reduction as as the initiative
would have had i'm very excited about
getting those
those things through the third thing i
have learned and
it's not so much about the initiative is
that the the jobs you can create here
are not just in urban areas this is a
small
town rural job development program that
we are going to be talking about on the
trail so
you know our carbon fiber manufacturing
for electric cars isn't seattle it's in
moses lake small town in central
washington
our biggest solar panel isn't in everett
you know in the western courts in a town
of 300 in eastern washington this is a
job creator
in multiple places and that's important
for democrats we need to win in the
midwest
we need to do a little better in some of
these areas and this is a great job
creator
to move forward now you mentioned the
filibuster i don't want to leave the
conversation without talking about that
there is absolutely no way to make
progress on this without eliminating the
filibuster and that's why i
have dedicated that and i've been saying
this for several years and was the first
candidate to say that running for
president because
you really cannot be dedicated to
climate change legislation or health
care legislation or
anything of any dimension unless the
filibuster goes it has been weaponized
by mitch mcconnell
and we have to step up to the plate and
realize that senatorial privilege
needs to go now how do we do it with the
democrats you might not get a vote at
times with maybe one democrat we got to
pick up a couple more seats to give us a
little bigger margin and
the voters are going to have a shot and
i think 2020
we have a good reason to believe if we
buckle down we can win more seats i
believe that
well since i'm glad you brought the
filibuster i wanted to just run through
a couple of similar
uh norm related proposals that
have been talked about the trail so uh
electoral college
uh look i believe in in democracy
and then the electoral college is an
artifact of the 13 colonies and
it needs to go we need popular elected
officials and it's kind of the same idea
of the reason to get rid of the
filibuster you should have one person
one vote
and don't give uh you know whoever wants
the status quo one and a half votes in
the filibuster
or you know privileged states in the
electoral college so yes and by the way
we can do this
without a constitutional amendment
because we have this
states agreement where we have states
have agreed
and my state is one of them that if to
be bound by the popular vote to cast our
electoral votes that way so this can be
done even without a constitutional
amendment
um statehood for d.c and puerto rico
i think it's the right thing um uh i
supported
back in you know 93 94 and it's even
become more acute as
those populations have grown and you see
a little bit why it's necessary when you
see how
callously indifferent donald trump has
been to folks who don't look like him he
he has two views of that and statehood
is it's been demonstrated why statehood
is important
so that these americans can participate
in the process uh last one on this topic
uh changes to the composition or term
limits of the supreme court
well i think the the the thing we should
start with is making sure that
that that seat that was stolen is
regained and is
you know if there is another nomination
by a republican
uh president we need to make sure that
seat is is remedied
because by the way that seat was not
just stolen from democrats it was stolen
from the american people
i would not totally rule out other
issues
amongst all of them i've heard of any
changes in the supreme court
would be an idea of having rotating
members of the court of appeals
so you'd have a broader group of judges
that could sit over time to sort of
reduce the politicization but i'm not
sold on that yet
let's make sure we write the way the
first way it is which was to regain that
seat
last week senator sanders introduced the
latest version of his medicare for all
legislation it was co-sponsored by
nearly all of your fellow candidates who
are currently serving in the senate
what is your reaction to to the sanders
proposal and
do you have a health care uh medicare
for all your health care plan
for your campaign yeah well the first
thing i would say is uh
regrettably uh senator sanders uh
a bill is is going nowhere because he
won't come out against the filibuster
unless you get rid of the filibuster
there's no way major healthcare
reform is going to pass that's just a
reality so
i'm hopeful over time he will follow my
lead and join me in saying the
filibuster needs to go
my view is that my state is a little bit
of a template what we should do on a
federal level we hope to be the first
state
to embrace a public option i have a bill
advancing right now
and we've been very successful in the
implementation of obamacare we've had
one of the largest drops of uninsured
of any state because our implementation
has been for
so effective and it's one of the things
i've learned being governor you actually
got to
produce you got to implement it's not
just putting it on paper
our opioid efforts have been very uh
not totally successful but other people
are looking at
us for guidance then on the federal
level
obviously we need universal health care
and i believe the next step ought to be
what a medicare for all who want it
right now which i think you can pass
rather than a 10-year argument which
gives you
a lower age for automatic eligibility
for medicare
and crucially an ability for everyone
who wants it to to
enter into the medicare system and i
think that's the most
rapid way that we can make a transition
here together with obviously bargaining
with pharmaceuticals so we can reduce
the
pharmaceutical costs that people are
exposed to
and another
issue that a lot of discussion on the
campaign trail
is gun safety laws and you are
you lost your seat in congress for
uh in part because of votes on on gun
gun control laws
what did you learn from that and how
would you approach that issue as
president
uh well what i what i learned as you
know i cast one of the pivotal votes
uh during the clinton administration to
ban assault weapons and when i did that
i knew i was jeopardizing my seat in
congress
and that did happen i was freed for
other duties by the voters
uh and you know it's and it's painful to
lose something you really
believe in which is working in congress
but what i learned is is that
you never regret what you do for
conviction and
i've never regretted that vote i've
always believed it was right vote then i
believe it's right vote now
and really had no regrets and the and
the thing that shows there's a little
justice in this sorry world is that now
i'm governor of a state that has
embraced
three measures to very aggressive
measures
which have actually probably one of the
leading states on gun safety now so
we've
adopted bans on you know bump stocks
we've adopted extreme risk protection
acts
we've um we've adopted increasing age
for
you know assault weapons we've adopted
uh bills to require gun owner
responsibility so
now as governor i've been able to move
the ball and we are now
you know frank the nra is in retreat in
our state because we have a governor
who's been able to
push back against them with the courage
of my convictions and and that's working
so uh i think the country is ready for
common sense gun legislation i'm happy
to pursue it
as president and we need somebody with
the spine to do it i think i've
demonstrated i have that capability
and i take it from this you think that
politics have changed on this issue
since the 90s
yes there's no question the politics
have changed you know it's it's there's
kind of a general theme here i think
politics is changing much more rapidly
than
many politicians understand it's changed
on gun safety dramatically because of
the losses in our schools
and i'm willing to confront trump on
this by the way i went to the white
house and
personally confronted him after the
shootings and he wanted to arm
first grade teachers with pistols on
their hip but i went and looked him in
the eye and said that's a ridiculous
idea and by the way you should quit
tweeting
and so much and listen to educators
they're changing on marijuana where we
have legalized
marijuana in our state and it has been a
unbridled success
in a variety of ways and i have uh
they're changing on issues of criminal
justice reform where i now have
offered pardons to people who had
marijuana convictions and i've ended the
death penalty
they're just changing they're changing
on climate change very rapidly
because people have seen
the the destruction this is no longer
just a line on a graph it's actually
seeing cities burned down they're
changing on the willingness of people to
embrace
helping working people that's why i've
been successful
we've passed the best paid family leave
in america we've
we've got we've we've passed the highest
minimum wage i've been the first person
to the first governor to pass
net neutrality uh we've passed a gender
pay equity
bill because we have this radical notion
that women
should be paid the same as men the point
i want to make is i think we need
leaders who
recognize the foment and the willingness
of americans to move forward and
we've done that in my state and i think
this is a template for
for success for the united states all of
the things i've just mentioned that
we've accomplished in washington i think
we do federally and but
how what would be your approach be that
would be different than the one
president obama took to try to get some
of those things done like what is that
changing how does that changing politics
manifest itself in a
in a strategy to enact these these
pieces of legislation these policies
well i think the things we've done in
washington should be federal policies
uh and and there's a couple that we have
not yet passed that i hope to in the
future
and i again i believe as the politics
change this will
this will be able to do this uh
why could i do this where the incredibly
talented amazingly
dynamic president obama could not it's
because it's we're later in the
in the arc of history there's more
people who want to do it now and
i think we're in that position to
recognize that ability to do that
another issue that's gotten a lot of
discussion on the campaign trail is the
role
uh that large tech companies have in our
economy
and uh you're from washington you're the
governor of washington state amazon
uh among others is a very you know
seattle's
one of the tech centers in america
amazon is headquartered there
uh microsoft's also in your state
is it if you were to be president you
would
have regulatory authority over these
companies and
is amazon in your view
too big too powerful in need of greater
regulatory scrutiny
how would you approach uh these
companies
well i think that there is a need
for for some approaches to some of these
issues it needs uh modernization
regardless of the size of the company
uh if you look at internet privacy for
instance we need privacy
legislation that will give consumers and
users
adequate degree of privacy we need that
for small medium and large companies
and that's why we are moving forward
with a privacy bill right now my
legislature it's not a done deal yet
we're working on some kinks
if we get it passed it'll probably
be on the equivalence actually even
better i think than the california law
and i think that that's kind of thing
that we we ought to do
federally i think that we have to look
at tax policy that
where we've had tax policies for large
corporations which were they have not
simply paid their freight now that's
most obviously
apparent in the oil and gas industry and
coal industry
where there's 27 billion dollars of
of subsidy that needs to be eliminated
we need to take that money back not
not reach into taxpayers pockets and and
and take it out to give to these
companies that have no
particular claim to it and that money
can be used for clean energy
efforts as well i think that we need to
look for ways to not allow
large corporations to hold communities
hostage on the issue of jobs
and there's been this pernicious
practice where communities
corporation will say you know if i don't
get a tax break of x
i'm going to move 20 000 jobs somewhere
and
then have two communities compete to the
lowest common denominator i think that
we ought to think about ways
to use the federal tax code to eliminate
their ability
um to do those i think on the antitrust
side
there are some things that antitrust
should always be under review because
to look at it under the current
situation there might be some things we
can look at that
i'm not necessarily a bot that there
should be some like just bright line of
dollars i don't think
that probably gets to the real heart of
the problem
uh in antitrust sense which is to really
look at
you know what the impact is in that
particular industry i think that's a
better approach i'm moving forward
the um
bernie sanders was talking the other day
about how in the state of vermont
the uh voting rights cannot be taken
away
right so fella if you uh are a felon
you come out of prison you still have
your voting rights and something has to
be re-given by the government or re
you know re-established by the
government's not a process do you
do you agree with that proposal that
voting rights are inalienable in that
sense
well in a sense they are or can be in
our state because you just have to apply
and if you've
if you've fulfilled your obligation and
we've reduced what you have to do at
this point to make it achievable
yes we want people when they've done
their their penance
to be able to regain their place in
democracy and that's important to give
people
respect to make them feel they're part
of the community
and everything we can do to help them
get back into jobs is very very
important
we're doing some really good things in
my state on criminal justice reform one
of which is
banning the box so right now
unfortunately a lot of places you know
in your job application they ask have
you ever been convicted of a crime and
if you say yes you never even get a
second look so we've banned that that
process we have eliminated the death
penalty because of the racial disparity
that has been
that has been so pernicious through our
criminal justice system
i mentioned that we've i've offered i'm
the first governor to offer
pardons for those for marijuana
convictions because the drug war we
know has been one of the reasons for
such high rates of incarceration of
communities of color
so we're moving forward in a lot of
different ways
to reduce the some of the racial
disparity
in our system and i'm glad we're moving
forward i hope we do it federally
if you were president you would
obviously have the ability to uh give
out pardons for those sorts of
um unfair drug-related senses is that
something you would be
you would be open to doing as you came
in office i would certainly look at this
because i think we've seen particularly
in the drug war
uh onerous measures that have that have
created more heartache than they've
created safety for citizens
and i think that part of the things i've
done on the pardons and
legalization of marijuana which i
believe we should do federally
obviously which i would suggest to
people uh
it's we've had a very good success on
this we've had
no great significant increase for
youthful involvement we've had 700
million dollars generated we use for
schools for kids and healthcare for
people
so uh i would look at that i think about
that i can't tell you there any
you know blanket thing i can commit to
you right now but i think it is
something worthwhile looking at on the
foreign policy side
uh bb not bibi netanyahu apparently won
reelection
recently if you were which poses
you know great if not mortal threat to
the idea of a peace process and a
two-state solution
um as president how would you uh
look to reinvigorate that process and
engage with both the israelis
and the palestinians well i would start
with the presumption that
i i've uh i've been a long supporter of
a democratic and secure israel it is a
it's a dream to continue that and
i'd want to be committed to the security
of israel
but i'd also be committed to a two-state
solution which
netanyahu's most recent comments have
jeopardized
and i would be willing to have that
creative discussion to try to keep this
effort alive to try to get some solution
here
and i am willing to have that
conversation and hopefully it's
productive
now i don't have because no human has a
way to snap your fingers and solve this
problem
but i think a willingness to have a
simultaneously commitment to the
security
of israel and a commitment to have a
democratic israel
which is very difficult if if you don't
eventually end up with a two-state
solution
to have both of those so i would be
committed to every way
productively to try to achieve that
another
uh issue the presidents face is
uh the relationship between presidents
and congress when it comes to using
military
force and you know we have been
uh operating off of a
now 17 year old uh authorization for use
of military force from
after september 11th to authorize
troops in syria is now mike pompeo has
floated a theory that you could use that
for
conflict with iran how would you think
as president about
the balance between asking congress for
authority
and the inherent authority of a
commander-in-chief to wage war
well the first thing is i wouldn't ask
for the authority if it was a
if it was a bone-headed idea and that's
one of the reasons i was such a vocal
opponent of the iraq war
see i teach you all for the iraq war
thing yeah it's still very painful thing
because
i saw disaster looming it was clearly
based on
intelligence that was that was puffed up
it was based on people who had no
concept what they were doing
during the bush administration and it
was very painful to me because i saw
this
it was like watching a train heading for
a
canyon where the bridge was out and
could not stop it and i did everything i
could to stop it
so the first thing i would do was to be
appropriately humble
on our ability to think that we can
reshape cultures
and countries and i think that we've
seen
quite a number of stakes in my lifetime
where presidents have been
a little bit too conceited about their
ability to reshape other cultures
and so i would start there
i do think that in the in the
the sanctions for war that they have to
be much more
limited and i voted for the essentially
after
9 11 i voted for the for the
authorization never dreamed that it
would have been to this extent
and if we had our life to live over
again we would have tried to put some
more side boards on it but i think we we
certainly need to do
do that right now because of this
administration's
absolute chaotic unprincipled
go it alone policy that threatens the
iran deal and if they're seriously
thinking of that
and you never know what trump's really
seriously thinking about
but if they really are then then
congress does need to specifically rein
that in
and maybe there's some possibility to do
that because some of the republicans are
starting to understand
the danger he represents when you have a
senator grassley calling
trump's view on wind power idiotic you
know maybe we'll get some help to try to
rein in this rogue president
you are one of i think we're at 15
16 candidates running for president it's
a historically large
historically diverse historically
talented field of democrats
how do you plan to stand out in a way
that allows you to make your case to
voters and have a real shot to win this
nomination
well first off i respect all the other
candidates i think there's probably
about 15 of them would make fine
vice presidents in their future so we'll
see about that
uh well look i stand out in in two
principle
means number one as we've talked about
i'm the only candidate who's committed
to make
defeating climate change number one and
i think that's a a very important thing
because i've learned as a governor to
governors to choose
and setting a priority is the most
important thing you do as a president
and so i've laid out my prioritization
no other candidate has been willing
to commit to that and i think it's
probably because they don't believe it
or maybe they're just afraid because
they listen to their posters and think
that this
isn't important enough i disagree with
them on that in fact there's a poll in
iowa of democratic primary voters
showing that
defeating climate change is tied for the
number one priority of voters so
that is a fundamental difference uh it
is a fundamental difference
having had the chops to be able to do
this because i've been at this for 20
years
and it's a fundamental difference that
i've actually achieved progress in my
state
knowing how to actually get this done uh
and the deeper one or the additional one
because some people said well is that
you're the only thing you're running on
i said no it's i'm running on the fact
that
i'm the only executive who's got the
best paid family leave
it is and we've i've passed the best
paid family leave in the united states
because i believe very intrinsically
that we have to allow
working families to be able to have a
life
we've passed the best paid the best
minimum wage no one else can say that in
this race
no one else can say that they signed the
first net neutrality bill in the united
states and this is something i worked on
in congress
for quite a period of time couldn't get
it done in congress
but i got it done as a as a chief
executive
we've adopted the gender pay equity bill
no one else can say that they've got one
i don't think
as good as as we do we've done a
reproductive parity act there are a few
other states that have that but i think
in this field i'm probably the only one
who's passed one
as a governor and i think another point
is
i've been able to have some real uh
successes even with the republican
senate
so uh we passed a couple years ago the
best and biggest transportation package
in the history of our state set 70
billion dollars worth of work and i did
that even with the republican senate
we had a similar success on education
funding
and through working for a lot of sweat
equity to get a bill through
we have several billion dollars of
additional help
including real big advances in early
child education and this is something
i've
believed in for a quarter of a century
uh and we've now got slots for an
additional 8
000 students we've had a tuition
decrease
we've had one of the most robust richest
financial
planned for for scholarships for our
students
and importantly of all the things that
i've been able to do one of the
to me one of the most gratifying is
i got 12 pay increases for educators
last year
this is a this is a big deal to me
because i think the best thing you need
is a
is a good teacher in a classroom my dad
was a biology teacher so
i'm a believer in this um the first
debate's coming up
uh in a couple months here and the dnc
put in place
standards to get into that debate
involving polling numbers and an ability
to generate
contributions online how is your
campaign doing in meeting that threshold
uh we're still working on it and as you
know uh anyone who'd
like to help on that get 65 000 donors
they can go to jayinslee.com
and i do it i hope people will think
about that because
regardless who you want to serve we want
to make sure climate change is on that
debate stage we want to make sure we've
got somebody who's very aggressive
on this issue who is never going to let
this happen again we're
in last three presidential cycles we had
exactly four minutes of debate time
so if you believe climate change needs
to be on that stage if you can go to
jamesley.com you can send anything from
a buck on up
um that would be wonderful to make sure
that
that works do you think these the
thresholds of dnc
set are fair or a good idea i haven't
really
thought through that whatever they are
they are yeah
you know having some threshold makes
sense i couldn't argue with it right now
um last question for you governor um
one of the you know democrats very much
want
if you in polls they say they want
someone who can win which is sort of an
obvious answer because why would you
want someone who would lose right
right right um but the ability to
and everyone's going to have their own
art you know no one really knows what
electability is every candidate will
have
an argument part of whoever the nominee
is has to be someone
who can deal with trump right and there
are different theories about how to do
that
and i think a lot of us believe that the
approach we took in 2016
obviously did not work and trump was
able to dominate the conversation can
and drown out democratic messaging if
you were the democratic nominee what
would be your
theory about dealing with trump as he's
given you some ridiculous nickname he's
tweeting about you
you know you're seeing you know absurd
unfair and inaccurate attacks how would
you
navigate those waters well i know he
likes nicknames but the only thing he's
going to call me is mr president
that's about all he's going to get to do
look i feel very comfortable in a
confrontation
with him in part because i've already
had one at the white house that i
described
and i think of a a very good contrast
because i am
an optimist look i'm an optimist about
defeating climate change and i really
believe we can and will do this he is a
pessimist
i'm a person who believes in the can-do
spirit of america he's in the can't do
we just can't do this we can't invent
new
wind turbines right we can't and we
can't invent electric cars
i'm a person who believes in the
expansionist nature of the american
story
that we are we have been in a very
unique country that has led the world in
so many different ways
he just wants to hide from the world and
and break up every alliance we have and
have a much
diminished view of the ambitions of the
united states i'm a person who believes
in diversity and inclusion
he believes that diversity is a vice
because he is
he's threatened by people who don't look
like him he fundamentally believes that
for him to win somebody else has to lose
and that's why he's damaged so much our
international relationships i believe
that
you do better when you work with other
countries that's one of the reasons i
committed to the paris climate change
agreement so i think i'm a very good
contrast to him as as a person in
outlook and i also believe in my ability
to win tough races and one of the
reasons is
we we this last year won seven
uh governorships while i was the chair
of the democratic
governors association and one of the
reasons we won those seats is we
insisted on having messages
that responded to the desire for
economic growth
for job growth for better schools for
better roads
and we addressed that sort of uh effort
that really
spoke to some of those people we didn't
reach in 2016.
i know how to win wisconsin michigan
minnesota illinois and kansas because we
did it this year
in the governor's races and i think the
kind of message i represent
is the one that allowed me to succeed
when i started my political career in
about a 63 percent republican district
an
agricultural community in a town of 3
000
where i learned to win because i spoke
to people about where they live
about their need for jobs and this this
clean energy jobs message is
fundamentally
a job creation message and i believe
that in 2007 when i co-authored this
book
which is about how you create clean
energy jobs so i feel very good
about the contrast and the prospects of
winning this
and i think we're going to be a united
party and i like to carry that flag
governor inslee thank you for joining us
of america
keep talking
you
