uh getting a little bit of feedback
brandon not sure exactly why
sending some stuff back to me but i
think we should be all right
um
obviously quite a crazy week uh this
week
ladies and gentlemen um
i'm getting a little bit uh you're
sending a little bit of a signal back to
me brendan
i don't know what's going on with that
uh you there
yep okay um
crazy week this week
no i can't hear myself this is weird um
all right yeah don't do that
uh a lot of stuff to cover
this week and i'm getting a feedback now
again brendan
are you there i'm here i don't yours
your zip is up
okay everything's normal on our end
okay all right well um
be that as it may we're getting a little
bit of feedback but i'll be all right
um crazy week the democrats of course
have passed the
the minimum wage it doesn't mean much
but it's good i don't know why nancy
pelosi
is um excited about something that's
going to die in the senate when
that has been such a problem in the
context of
impeachment but i guess uh in this
context it doesn't uh really matter
um
let's go here well let's play
this sound donald trump
apparently uh is disavowing
everything he had to say the other night
at the
campaign rally
mr president if i may when your
supporters last night were challenging
chanting send her back
why didn't you stop them why didn't you
ask them to stop saying
well number one i i think i did i
started speaking very quickly
it it really was a loud i disagree with
it by the way
but it was quite a chant and
i felt a little bit badly about it but i
will say this uh
i did and i started speaking very
quickly but it started up rather
rather fast as you probably know
there you go rather fast
rather fast
um i i was talking i really felt bad
about it
what happened was it was so fast in the
auditorium
and they were speaking about the jews in
a way that was so extra
yeah they got their way out in front of
me um
that's what it was it's almost like were
you supposed to wait on that a couple of
months
meanwhile it's not just you know donald
trump doesn't uh it's not donald trump's
problem it's uh it's also uh
it's his his his his followers
that are the problem here um
here's a clip of a geraldo trying to
defend him
it's clip number four
go back to where you came from is the
old racist trope that all of us
uh uh ethnic or racial minorities have
grown up with at various times it is
unforgivable at this day and age and i i
really
lament that it came up i'm glad the
president has
said what he said and i think that the
crowds if you
love this president then don't ever do
that again at one of his rallies because
what you do is you diminish him
he is the glue that holds our republic
together
he is the man that makes a pluribus unum
work
out of many one we cannot ever
fall back into that lazy kind of the
other uh that uh that we did for several
days
there you go to be the problem is his
followers
i don't want to say to be i hate the
phrase in fact to be fair but i i
in this case as i watch that with the
sort of like
you know the slobbering over trump that
to me is the
you know he gets everything from fox
please stop doing this
message not you know are you saying
geraldo is saying that message
that's my interpretation and i have no
brief for geraldo but that's how i read
that uh i think trump
it's it's impressive that trump walked
it back because you know he enjoyed it
loved it of course
it's uh
it's shocking i still i i i i it's it's
shocking
super disturbing now we'll talk more
about that with uh

sorry about that guys thank you uh
michael we had a little bit of problem
on the phone it's a pleasure to welcome
to the program
the proprietor of the benjamin dixon
show
ben dixon ben welcome to the program
sam thanks for having me man it's always
a pleasure um
i have no idea where to start this week
uh ben
it's been a week um it it it seems like
uh ages ago but uh
the week started off with mike pence
basically parading
in front of a room full of caged men
uh inspecting oh wow the the tower i
mean can you believe that was that was
only five six days
i honestly don't i i would have thought
that was two or three weeks ago
by now um and
it was almost i think i mean frankly i
think it was the launch of
the um the the 2020 campaign
for for the the the trump administration
and they rolled out all of the
various i guess shades of racism
uh that that they have in their arsenal
and
uh by the end of the week i think we
basically saw the entire
um the entire campaign play out
yeah i have to agree this is definitely
the way that they're going to run the
entire campaign
and what's what's so wild about this sam
is that um
a couple things number one it's
effective it's going to
work to a certain degree now whether or
not he wins that remains to be seen
but it rallies is his base and the
republicans
um who might feel a little squeamish
about it they go along with it
and so it's it's really his path towards
victory
um if we're not careful the other side
about it is
it's so potent that it does have the
potential of dividing the country in a
way that we've never seen in our
lifetimes
um and and uh he seems to have no
remorse whatsoever not even his
afterthought
about what this type of campaign will do
to democracy here in this country oh god
no
i mean uh and we will play this clip
later i don't know if you saw this clip
of um
of trump talking to this uh
uh yazidi uh woman um who
uh nadia murad and
um it's i mean this guy doesn't care at
all
and what i think is really um sort of
stunning
is how little it appears that the rest
of the republican party does
i mean yeah i mean we're talking
hundreds of lawmakers
and uh you got i think what we have four
people who voted with the uh the
democrats on this condemnation
and i think that was before the uh that
was before the rally
wasn't it
benny there yeah i'm here can you hear
me yeah you're breaking up a little bit
i am here sam i i mean i think that was
before the republic
yeah i do believe that that was before
the rally um and um
the the fascinating thing about this one
sam is that is
is that the republicans not only are
going along with it
but they're doubling down on it like um
lindsey graham
right for instance lindsey graham is
doubling down on donald trump's
ignorance
uh and on his bigotry and we're finding
that like throughout
rank and file uh republicans who would
at least
in 2016 prior to 2016
they would have at least tried to give
the appearance of not being
outright open bigots uh but now donald
trump has provided sufficient cover for
them to just
live their best racist lives um
it it i i don't know it's pretty
stunning and
i i uh we had a
uh an attempt to i guess impeach the
president or start impeachment
preachings uh proceedings
i guess this is on wednesday now i don't
know time is completely dilated for me
uh but it was um
[Music]
uh the the motion for impeachment was
tabled essentially it was a procedural
vote uh
and it basically um you know put it to
the side
i have a feeling they'll come back and
take another bite at that apple a little
bit later
um i i you know
on some level it i i mean i
i i don't know i mean i i it's it's it's
really sort of
uh it's a scary scenario we're 15 months
out
one can only imagine you know he's got
to escalate this right i mean he's going
to
because i mean that's just the nature of
the way that trump works and i feel like
for uh years i've been telling people
it's going to get worse before it gets
better and i still
think that that's the case yes
it was hard to imagine right with some
of the things that donald trump was
pulling
over the last couple of years it was
hard to imagine how it could get worse
but with this with the launch of this
campaign he has
i don't know he's really found the one
way
that we could rip ourselves apart at the
seams like
i i cut an entire point i did a video
this week and i cut an entire portion
out because i didn't want to seem too
grim or too fatalistic but i cut the
portion out because i
really said i don't know how we come
back from this
like how do we as a as a nation come
back from what donald trump is getting
ready to do with us
and that was monday i had no idea that
the week was going to get so much worse
i should have just left it in there
because
really that's the question if donald
trump goes all the way with the campaign
the way he's talking right now
i don't know how we come back as a
nation
yeah i i mean i i
there's going to be a lot of i i don't i
don't know either to be honest with you
i mean i think that on some level it's
just a matter of
uh the the idea here has to be
that they are just simply defeated
right like i mean i i keep waiting
for a broader and maybe it's there
but i don't know how durable it is i
mean it sort of feels like
there has been a um
a palpable shift in the media
and in the mainstream understanding of
of not just donald trump but of the
republican party
i don't know i mean do you do you feel
that's the case
sam i lost you there for a second um i i
don't i i didn't catch that question in
my review
i was asking if you thought there has
been like a palpable
change in the the media
or the the the media's perception
i think of the republican party
um i don't know that's a that's a
difficult one i i would like to think
that
this week opened the eyes of at least a
handful of journalists
but we're i mean this week they had um
uh spencer richard spencer on cnn right
jake tapper had him on his show so i'm
not really sure
um if there's if the change is positive
right
you would think that it would be
positive there's some journalists who
have come out and
expressly calling what donald trump is
uh they're calling it for what it is
um but i'm not sure that the
institutions the media institutions are
going to
uh play the role that they need to play
i think they're still trying to be
um quote unquote fair and balanced and
inevitably
leaning towards fascism because they're
giving donald trump uh
cover in so many ways um
we had another situation where the
prosecutors apparently
in the um uh in the hush money to
um uh you know the paid during the
campaign
apparently donald trump it was released
was on the phone calls
uh about stormy daniels
and the prosecutors have now you know
basically it's clear
that to the extent that they decided not
to
bring charges it was a function
of this doj um uh
you know internal ruling essentially
their assessment from the office of
legal counsel
remember this is the same office
incidentally right that uh said torture
is legal
right and uh on some level and
you know i i imagine that
this is the assessment of the the doj
i it's never been tested at the supreme
court
and i don't know who would have standing
necessarily to bring this question
to the supreme court i imagine we won't
find out
until there's a democratic president and
the republicans
trying to do this um right but
we're i i mean you know there's been
different times where
i feel like over the past couple of
years and
certainly you know after the first like
month or two um
i i was a little bit less concerned
but you start to really see the
creakiness
in our system and you know this week
after donald trump came out and made
those statements about
ilan omar uh bill barr came out and said
basically the exact same thing in much
more i guess polite words and i don't
know if you saw that
but a combination of bill barr uh coming
out and doing that and basically saying
like
i am donald trump i am defending donald
trump the individual
not the institution of the president it
really starts to make me wonder just
you know sort of how um smooth
a transition of power uh could be
in this situation i mean i you know like
i i i
i know this kind of talk is a little bit
they're it's very easy to slip into some
measure of
hyperbole and when other people have
articulated this to me in the past i've
been a little bit
um i you know would have been a little
bit
uh uh i don't know i've dismissed it
pretty easily but you start to see this
stuff and we're
we're 18 months out and it's still it's
it
it looks a little difficult
i'm sorry we're having a little trouble
connecting are you there uh ben
yes sam i'm here can you hear me yeah uh
what's your sense of that
yeah so that you really
my big question this entire week has
been
how does america absorb this how do we
how do we adjust for this how do we
compensate for this type of
uh this type of leadership uh because we
see now the
the creeks that you mentioned that are
in our system um donald trump was
uniquely fit to exploit them
um anyone who has just complete
disregard for our norms and our
institutions the rule of law
um and they're able to win the
presidency they're able to exploit
all of these weaknesses in our democracy
couple that with
individuals who are more loyal to the
individual man than they are the
institutions and
the nation as a whole i mean it is the
perfect combination
for chaos and this is when i say chaos i
mean a a
a chaotic transition to power like you
mentioned but this is
pre-campaign like he just launched the
campaign this week
can you imagine all of those factors
compounded with
uh the type of campaign that he looks
like he's getting ready to run
and uh i mean i i don't want to lean
towards hyperbole i don't want to be
a scaremonger but i mean it could get
really ugly for america
um and we have a president who has zero
regard
for the type of chaos that he could
cause
uh for america let's talk a little bit
about the um
presidential campaign because you know
at this point if and and i just don't
know how
um i i i don't know how nancy pelosi
continues to justify this frankly
but um that you know we're not going to
see any legislation get passed
any legislation that we you know uh are
are hopeful about
uh there may be some small things i
think there's some bipartisan agreement
on the do not call registry uh thing and
that's
that's good to see right and um
uh chuck schumer i think is gonna be
able to maybe get us another
inch and a half on the um
in our our leg room and our planes
that's not bad
um but uh
really it's you know uh presidential
politics take on
a uh a an even greater import
i think on some level i mean i you know
obviously people are going to have to
get into the streets at one point
if it continues on this way and i think
like you know
organizing is uh hugely important
probably uh more important but this
stuff is it's
it's fascinating there was a poll uh
that came out
nbc news uh survey monkey
and uh the national numbers weren't uh
particularly you know shocking
uh they've been consistent with what
we've started to see in terms of a trend
biden at 25
sanders and warren at 16 harris had 14
percent bootage at three and then at
eight rather and then o'rourke
booker yang castro at three and two
percent
but here's what's interesting in terms
of the breakdown of
of uh of race uh
for white people warren is at 22 biden's
at 21
uh then harris and sanders are tied at
15
for black people biden's at 37
harris and sanders are tied at 14
booker and warren at 5
i mean i got to think on some level
that as donald trump
attacks like just becomes
more and more racist and
um you see these chants like send her
home
right or send her back or whatnot that
this could be helpful to a joe biden in
so far as
the um there is a
there's got to be like you know i mean i
think a big part of biden's support
has got to be a in association with
barack obama
for sure and b a perception
that he is the safest
choice in some way i don't happen to
agree with this but
but that he might be the safest choice
and
you know for people of color in this
country
you start to get into like this is an
existential issue at this point
yeah yeah i i'm with you i don't agree
that he's the best
choice to beat trump i think that is i
think the argument there
falls apart really easily when you see
what donald trump is able to do with
with joe biden's history um so no one is
going to have an easy road against
donald trump right
let's just start there uh the third
factor i think i mean you know the first
two i think the third factor is
is that joe biden really represents to a
lot of people going back to normalcy
and i think that's fallacious too
because there is no going back to a
normal state after this right what what
what donald trump has done to the
country uh has irrevocably moved us
in a detrimental direction but
definitely towards the right i mean if
we there is no going back to normal when
he has had over 100
judicial picks um that are all probably
sycophants right
um his impact on the supreme court uh
his impact on the national discourse
like
there really is no going back to normal
so if people are looking for joe biden
to be the safe bet
and the bet to take us back to normal i
think that's a really bad bet
and i i think that the primaries are
going to flesh that out for us i think
we're going to see a lot more
uh biden's not going to survive for a
whole lot longer
um that's just maybe i'm wishful
thinking here
um but i'm i'm counting on the primaries
to really flesh this out for us
yeah i think that's the i mean that
that's my sense too i just wonder
that you know i don't know that a lot of
biden's support i mean you know
we're we're still in a a time period
where people haven't necessarily fully
engaged in the primary and so i think
it's easy for people to have those
assumptions about biden because
uh he was the vice president um right
they released
the uh lineups for the next democratic
debate i missed the
um i don't know what you call it the uh
the lottery that cnn did or whatever it
was
uh but on night one marianne williamson
tim ryan abe amy klobuchar
uh then beto o'rourke
john hickenlooper john delaney who's
incidentally it's being reported now
that his own staff has basically said
fire us by august yeah uh
and steve bullock so basically
nobodies and people to judge bernie
sanders and elizabeth warren
and i'm just let's just start with that
what kind of dynamic do you think that's
going to create
um i mean my sense is that warren and
sanders
it's too early for them to go at each
other but maybe that's not the case
what do you think is going to happen
there i i'd be surprised if they went
after each other because they
uh both of them in the first debate they
they both
made an impact but they both set back
and allowed everyone else to kind of
mess over each other
uh which is a pretty good tactic in my
opinion they had a strong
opening and then they set back a little
bit i don't see that they're ready to go
head-to-head
against each other um because that's
going to be a net benefit for like
a booty judge in that kind of uh
scenario so i think we may see
again where they're both going to make
strong statements they may have one
skirmish between the two of them but i i
don't think it's going to
uh devolve into anything that's going to
give someone like
mayor pete an advantage in that in that
debate so um
uh other than those two that it really
oh marion williamson's i just do
i do have to say this about her like as
much as i'm i'm not in favor of her
campaign and
i'm really not a fan of the spiritual
guru types i really do appreciate her
running if for no other reason than what
she did to dave rubin
on his own show that was worth that was
worth it all
yes i think that's absolutely the case
uh that was definitely worth watching
um i think i'll tell you something this
first night is going to be fascinating i
think
because um almost everybody on that
stage except for marianne williamson
and pete buddha judge let's put them
aside for a moment but we talked tim
ryan amy klobuchar beto o'rourke john
hickenlooper
john delaney and steve bullock they're
all going to go at
bernie sanders and elizabeth warren on
ideological grounds
right and this is going to give i think
both of
both sanders and warren and particularly
sanders because
he has the most distinct ideology at
least from a rhetorical standpoint
uh from warren right i mean she has made
it clear
uh that she's a full-throated capitalist
but obviously needs uh
some reform sanders is saying that we
need a political revolution
this is going to be i think um
a huge opportunity for
the left of the democratic party because
like they couldn't go against you know
here's the thing sanders doesn't want to
go directly at joe biden
in the first debate because some of uh
biden's supporters have to come to
sanders at one point
right but they're gonna be on stage with
people who between one two three
four five six of them they don't even
have i think ten percent of the vote
right yeah and so he's gonna go up there
and and warren i imagine to some extent
as well
and they're going to have to a they're
going to have to defend
the the left and i think they're good
they're going to want to do
actually even more than that i think
they're going to take this as an
opportunity
and really uh explain why we need
we cannot go back to the era of john
delaney and whatnot
and there's no cost for them to go at
these guys not necessarily as
individuals there's no point right
but to go at their ideology because they
will all be surrogates for joe biden
oh yeah oh yeah no i you know that's a
great that's a great way of looking at
it
i i also see this this this really may
be the end of the road for a couple of
those
names um particularly john delaney like
i do see
he he he really believes what he says
and um
even though he's completely wrong he
believes it enough to jump out there
and that's gonna be the perfect
opportunity like you already said that's
gonna be the perfect opportunity for
bernie sanders and elizabeth warren to
just kind of make some hay
uh both for the left as well as clearing
the field so i wouldn't be surprised if
after this debate
uh we see a couple of those um people
from night one drop
out yeah i agree with you and um the
other i guess
you know point that needs to be made
about that every single person on that
stage on the first night will be white
yeah and on the second night um um
we have joe biden then kamala harris
cory booker julian castro andrew yang
tulsi gabbard jay inslee bill de blasio
and michael bennett
and chris and gillibrand and that's also
going to be a fascinating night because
yeah
i would imagine the the theme of joe
biden
talking about how nice it was to have
segregationists and this notion that
you know everything's going to return to
normal right that's joe biden's
that's joe biden's uh pitch that i'm
gonna return things to normalcy
and i have a feeling i would hope that
um
half of the people on that stage three
quarters are going to say to joe biden
what makes you think after watching what
we saw this week
and the reaction in the polls let's say
to things like um you know uh that
that you're gonna return this to normal
like what makes you think that the
we don't have a big divide in this
country right now
and i think something else that's going
to be exposed specifically because of
that dynamic right the racial tension
the racial dynamic
uh night two you have all the people of
color
versus joe biden um i think that night
is going to expose that joe biden
is not as tough as people like to
imagine that he is he's not that skilled
of a debater
um he's not as quick on his toes as he's
going to need to be
to go up against uh donald trump if
donald trump is nothing else he is a
witty
um he's witty with his combats he can
come back and really make you pay
the price for saying something stupid
right and and we're going to see that on
on night two i think
once people get a hold of joe because
everyone's going to come out to jail
they have nothing to lose everything to
gain
and i don't think joe is going to be in
a position
where he can stand his ground uh where
he can actually make some hay out of it
like
bernie sanders and elizabeth warren
would do for night one so um i i think
it's gonna be a good night
for america to really see yet again that
joe biden is not up to the task he's not
the best
bet to go up against um um what's donald
trump i couldn't think of that guy's
name for a second it's been that crazy
of a week
yeah it's gonna be uh i think these are
both really
uh interesting sort of slates to be
honest with you i mean i suppose
it could work that way i would like to
see at one point warren
with biden because warren uh you know
has a particular portfolio that um
that that joe i mean i think joe biden
was one of the reasons why she got into
politics
i mean like electoral politics on some
level um
because of that bankruptcy bill but um
this is a i mean this is a very good
situation i think from the perspective
of people who
are of the left in the democratic party
because
um we're going to see a a
you know an opportunity for sanders and
warren
to go full-throated against the
um the establishment politics the
you know the the hickenlooper john
delaney bullock
uh politics and the sort of the uh
emptiness on some level
of the rhetoric of uh uh buddha judge
and o'rourke although you know buddha
judge i think is uh
far more adept at this stuff and and
maybe even has more substance uh than
o'rourke does
but um it's going to be interesting to
see
uh then they're all going to come for
for warren and sanders
i mean
but um i don't know i i mean i
th this week has has really left me
in you know i think more
speechless uh than i've been in in ages
like i i just the
uh relentlessness of it the the
nakedness of it
the i mean i suppose it's a good sign
that trump had to walk it back a little
bit or pretend it wasn't him
and that they've all they're all on
board of this yesterday we saw
you know we saw the beginning of the
week fox and friends
because this is like the the uh and and
i don't want to elevate the importance
of fox and friends uh in the context of
american politics
but when you want to get a sense of what
the sort of like
the the the the center of the right
the hard rights softest margins are
that's fox and friends right like that's
like their
it's like the um it's like you know uh
the
it's almost like their cooking show on
some level
and uh it's the soft ed and and the way
that
you know they started off the week
saying that donald trump was being
really comedic with his tweets
yeah and then um they described the uh
the chant of send her back it's like
things got a little
raucous and uh they were blowing but you
know like
that i i mean we're
we're at a stage now where it sort of
feels like
you know they um they're not
full-throatedly
denouncing this stuff you're sort of
keeping the door
open to go further and yes i get this
sort of like feeling that you know six
months from now
they're instead of saying it was the
crowd that just did this chant they're
gonna say well
i mean let's face it if she doesn't like
it here they should they should go
back right i mean think about this now
newt gingrich former
speaker of the house was on fox news
saying that exact thing
right so this is this is i'm not
impressed by don't well i mean there was
nothing to be impressed by
but the fact that he walked it back just
an inch that
that's that's his mo like if he does
something ridiculous
he will come back an inch and then watch
next week he's going to run a full mile
on us and go in the opposite direction
right so uh
his his you know excuse that the crowd
got out of control or whatever
um next week he himself is not he's
probably gonna double down on this
because that's what he's done in the
past but that speaks to another problem
sam
there is no more normal when
so many of the republicans in this
country
actually not only identify with what
donald trump is doing but are willing to
go even further than donald trump is
presently willing to go
so for anyone who thinks that we could
just go back to normal without
actually addressing these issues in a
substantive and
almost combative fashion we've got a
fight we've got a serious fight on our
hands
and part of the fight is not just
economic yes we do have economic
issues that we absolutely must address
we have to go towards the left we need
social policies we need medicare for all
hell we need universal basic income we
need a lot of different things
but we have to fight the culture wars
because this is where billionaires are
pouring all of their money into
all these people you see on youtube uh
the ben shapiro's the dave rubins
they're getting funded to fight the
culture war and we're seeing the result
of that
not only from the youtube contingency
obviously the the the decades-long
experiment or the
two decades-long experiment of fox news
it has all been about the culture war
and we have a significant portion of
this country
that not only buys into what donald
trump is saying they want him to go
further
and there's no going back to normal if
you're not ready to fight that head-on
there's only a new normal
that can be had after this well you know
uh andrew breitbart
um who you know folks like uh shapiro
uh was spawned of i guess on some level
and yeah um and uh of course you know
bannon came in and was uh more or less a
partner of his the mercers
breitbart's big creed occur
i guess was that
uh politics is downstream from culture
and part of that was just because of his
own resentment that you know
the the guys in hollywood didn't want to
hang out with him uh
and and and you saw it with ben shapiro
you know had interest in becoming a uh a
screenwriter in hollywood and then
you know obviously couldn't because he's
conservative and that's why he couldn't
he could get a job but um
this i i mean i think this is i i think
this is increasingly
the case right and um i mean that's
i i mean i agree with you i think it's
it's becoming
there is so much of our politics
uh is par this this this culture
war they have been able to sort of
activate
more and more on the right i mean
because this is yeah well patrick
pat buchanan was calling for this in 93.
he was calling for it when uh on some
level
it worked uh under nixon right
i mean that was uh pat buchanan's whole
thing we're going to split the country
in half
and uh we've got the bigger half is what
he said at the time
and um and
and and it worked then you know the the
it
and maybe maybe it's becoming more
extreme or more naked only in relief
on some level that there is you know in
the sense that like
i don't know that attitudes were worse
in 1972
it may be just that on the you know to
the center to the
left attitudes are better and so
there's a higher consciousness of this
stuff or maybe they're getting more
extreme uh because
you know they're they're feeling that
power
[Music]
uh diminished i don't know i mean yeah
i mean the slightest amount of power
lost and they swear they are the most
oppressed
people in the history of all oppression
um but
never mind the fact that they're in
power almost throughout the entire
country
can you imagine if white conservative
men
actually became a margin i mean
marginalized community they would be in
the streets burning stuff down
every single day uh but to your point um
i don't know that they're actually
worse um but i do think that they're
more
indifferent uh towards well actually let
me start that over
i think there are less social
ramifications because their reward
structure they have an entire reward
infrastructure uh that that actually
rewards them for this type of behavior
i don't think that infrastructure was
there as much in the 70s or the 80s
um where you could maybe you don't win
an elected
office but you get yourself a nice
commentary job making three hundred
thousand dollars a year
uh if you can go out and say the most
salacious and outrageous thing
uh so now they can be rewarded for their
bigotry
in a way that we went through a slight
period i mean it was really just a
really brief period in american history
where you would be penalized
for your open bigotry i think we're in a
place now where you could be rewarded
because that country that they divided
in half
has all types of spoils to give to them
do you think that what we're looking at
is
you know 50 years ago let's say 40 years
ago
um you know you know
let's just peg it around the the the
um the mid to late 60s there was
all sorts of structural support and not
structural but
but um structural but also institutional
support
right for racism for white supremacy
uh legal support and
institutional support the legal support
for white supremacy
for the most part right not necessarily
in practice but in terms of the letter
of the law
although right that's been rolled back
with the voting rights act uh
and other things but the the the legal
support for
um white supremacy is diminished
relative to where it was for sure
40 50 years ago uh the institutional
support is probably diminished in some
areas
um uh maybe maybe across the board but
it's still pretty prominent in some
other areas like policing for instance
and the carceral state um
and on some level
that white people slash
the republican party uh i mean honestly
i mean that's that's a that's
simply a factual the description of the
republican party
are are trying to regain
what they lost from a legal
uh perspective and perhaps an
institutional perspective
in a cultural perspective
i i well i i yes okay i think i piece it
together you're saying what they lost
institutionally they're trying to make
up culturally right
um and and i think that they've done
that they've they are successful
in that they have a system i mean we
talk about this all the time they have a
structure where they can take a no name
nobody
and they can elevate them to national
prominence in a matter of a few days
you know um and so they have the
cultural
impact they have the structure they have
they don't have institutions they don't
have legal institutions anymore
but they do have private institutions
they do have
uh think tanks they have um outlets like
prageru
and and the heritage foundation you know
all these organizations i mean
countless organizations that can enrich
someone
and reward them for being able to make
inroads in the culture war
if they can find right now their latest
move is
the move towards um uh the people you
know collecting all of their people of
color
to do this work right because that's far
more powerful than a white person
doing all of this uh is to have a person
of color so right now they have a muslim
uh who will go out and deride islam they
have a black woman who will go out and
deride black people i mean they have so
that is what they're making their
inroads through and that's how they're
making it
and um and i think that they see the
value that even if we can't
um legally discriminate or even if we
can't legally
um suppress because really what this is
about is protecting that white male
power structure that bill o'reilly and
john mccain were talking about on fox
news some years ago
it's really about insulating that power
structure and if they can't do it
legally
they have found a way to do it
culturally right
well next week's another week i'm sure
it's going to be just as horrible
i can't believe that that visit um
that mike pence's visit was this week i
honestly i i have to
go back and google that because uh
you're right time dilation is hitting us
seriously right now
i think those face app uh where everyone
aged themself and gave their information
to the russians
um i think it really is far more
accurate than we really want to believe
because of the pace of our new cycle i
feel like i've aged
um well i'm old but i feel like we've
aged even uh
more rapidly over the past i don't know
12 months
for sure michael are you gonna no i'm
gonna say sam you have been you haven't
my friend well i appreciate that mike i
appreciate that
even though i know it's not true man
i've aged so much man this last two
years have been
really rough and i just i think it's
been rough on a lot of american people
we
we're gonna have to have some ptsd uh uh
treatment for most of americans once we
get past
and get past this trump stage and get to
the new normal
but i don't think that's gonna happen
right i mean like i don't think
i mean i think that i i just i think
there's gonna be a couple of months
but then i think tom cotton or whoever
it is
is gonna come back and and i don't i
don't think getting rid of trump
it will it will maybe make it less
telegenic
on some level for a brief period of time
but i don't think this goes away
i mean i i think they're i think it's
going to take
um it's some dramatic change
and it's going to need dramatic change
and time can i run one great thing by
you guys
yeah i i think that this is another
reason why very specifically and
you know we're still in the primary but
you know hopefully we'll never
get to this point but i i think one of
the things that's also so specifically
destructive
about biden uh is one i think he could
team up with republicans to do things
like cut social security and medicare
which we've talked about
yeah and two because i think he will be
probably more than any other candidate
on a continuum
uh a willing co-participant in these
people taking a couple years
to launder themselves and pretend they
didn't do all this
incidentally before we get to 2022 and
2024
when they restarted up again but he will
be exactly the one to be like yup come
to the white house i know that was a
weird aberration
and let's just pretend you weren't
willing code participants uh for this
whole journey yeah we
we we could have pulled this uh the
other day but um
mark sanford was on uh chris hayes the
other night
and mark sanford is is is uh
contemplating a presidential run
against hay uh against uh trump that's
chris hayes
and against chris hayes and he said
he he sort of implied this at first and
then hayes asked him directly he said
the
number one challenge facing this country
right now
is the deficit in debt and
and hayes was like wait are you
are you serious are you are you are you
seriously saying that and he goes yes
and then he said like
you guys are just going to pretend like
that's the case when
a democrat gets in office and the whole
cycle is going to start over again
and i'm quite i'm quite convinced i mean
there was a story
um rush limbaugh i was reading
uh somehow i stumbled onto reason
magazine
rush limbaugh was basically saying like
yeah don't worry about spending that was
just a
trap that we set for the democrats
and he's going to snap back
the moment um you know bernie sanders is
elected or elizabeth warren
is elected or pete but a judge
is elected these they're immediately
going to be like the deficit in debt
is the biggest problem that we have it's
going to be vimar germany and et cetera
et cetera and
biden will will let them do and i
actually i think that i put
bootage on the side of that equation as
well i think you're going to have to do
that as well
let them launder it yep and this is this
is why we have to have
there has to become a new normal right
so when i say uh get past
trump i mean we we can get past trump
and go right back to the way things were
and because we don't have the
infrastructure on the left
held not even the democratic party this
is as powerful as they are
they don't have the infrastructure to
command the new cycles
and to command the the discourse the way
republicans do
and so if we go back to normal it will
be exactly that i mean republicans will
just reset
their 20-year cycle and here we are
we're going to be fighting about
deficits
but we have to get to a new normal which
is going to include
shattering this entire notion of
republicans being fiscally conservative
and shattering the notion that we have
to worry about deficits because we've
never worried about deficits underneath
republicans in the first place and
coupled with that has to be someone
who's willing
to fight the culture war on a level that
can help us reset this because
if if not the tom cottons can come in
the future right
but if we don't put some if we don't
find a way
to make it to make it um
socially unacceptable to be this open
bigot and run these bigoted campaigns
with
loud dog whistles with bull horns um
then we will just keep going further and
further down this slippery slope towards
fascism
i i the i i i think it's that's why it's
so important
that you know at this point the the
the project um largely has to be
to um make sure that donald trump and
the republican party
are synonymous that there is no
and and um and you know not even argued
necessarily that they're they're they
the republicans lack fiscal discipline
because
i don't think that should be the the
fight i think the the point is
that they're a a the the
the the republican party is um
it's it's broken it is it is not
a political party this conservative
movement
is um is largely i think just
authoritarianism
and um there doesn't seem to be any type
of rational set of ideology
that doesn't really involve um
you know the xenophobia and the racism
you know they're
um you know you don't hear people
cheering like
we want wages or we
want jobs or economic development
right i mean it is uh misogyny it is
uh racism it's xenophobia um
and you you strip that away there's just
not much
there and it's it's also
at best a willingness to
exploit these things for
massive corporate giveaways absolutely i
mean that's
exactly it sam um we and and i
i i don't i think that's a distinction
in many respects
without a difference if you're willing
to
um just walk by and parade in front of a
cage full of men who
who haven't you know who've been denied
showers and a place to sleep for 40 days
so that you know the epa can
allow um you know pesticide companies to
use something
for that that that hurts kids
neurological development
i mean you're you're a racist and
on top of that you know your is plus
i agree you know that that's that is
this the sheer reality of this
the people in the crowd last um well
whatever night that was
at this point the people in that that
crowd they may not even be cognizant
some of them may be beneficiaries of of
the corporate handouts that donald trump
has given them but the majority of them
are there uh because of the fury that
donald trump is able to rev them up in
and and and it goes one it's hand in
hand it's it it is the what's the matter
with kansas
scenario on on meth right it's like on
steroids and where
where now they have they are clearly
free to be their full
bigoted selves while their corporate
overlords in the background saying this
is perfectly fine for us because
now we can gut every safety uh every
safety net every safety measure every
uh everything that has ever given us
progress over the last century we can
gut it
while they're out there celebrating the
racism yeah i mean this this
you know i mean maybe we need a a a
a some version of like crypto racism
or neo-racism or utilitarian racism or
something like that to describe
you know donald trump is really a nice
guy at heart he's not really a racist
um mitch mcconnell is not really a
racist they're just using
racism and uh misogyny to
you know um provide tax cuts uh for
their people or to um
i mean like just for the sake of
of bringing people on board you know
maybe you need to put like some type of
qualifier on the racism so that people
feel more comfortable with it like
hey we're not burning crosses on
anybody's house we're just
basically exploiting uh the the
um the impetus to do that to uh
achieve corporate aims yeah i i guess
another question with that would be like
who
who would we win with that argument only
because they have a full throated
acceptance of racism on the
on the right and then we have um kind of
this
uh this milk toast um
approach from from from um nancy pelosi
from from uh joe biden i mean the
centrist democrats i i don't know that
they would even
be moved by that argument um just simply
because of how they're reacting to
donald trump
but the sentiment is 100 accurate i mean
you're absolutely right can i just real
quick one other just thing on this
that actually though correlates with
calling out
the disingenuous and and really and sort
of
you know trash pseudo identity uh things
that are marshaled by
disingenuous democrats as well because
the whole context
of part of the drama with the twitter
account and the and
clearly them trying to get the aoc
staffer fired
was that he said if you're a democrat
and you voted for a border funding bill
without any
accountability for the border system
that is functionally a racist vote
among many other things and they went to
immediately well
cherise david's voted for it and she's
native american in the most you know
crass identitarian nonsense and he
responded and he said
well you can be of color or
any identity and in fact enable a racist
system and that is
actually the deeper point and that will
implicate
a lot of democrats as far as i'm
concerned absolutely
i mean and that's self-evident right i
mean
clarence thomas well that's the other
thing well they always wanted well
people want to always i'm not saying
that
i'm not i'm not comparing um the
charisse davis but it's on a sliding
spectrum
yes right like and and there's plenty of
data i mean
this uh you know the uh we we've talked
about this uh i mean eddie cloud's book
you know sort of walks through the the
notion and others
that for that matter that white
supremacy is a practice
and uh it is something that uh it's not
you know uh white supremacy can be
practiced by
uh any member of any race uh you're
you you're conditioned in certain areas
i mean uh you have certain other agendas
but um
it doesn't get worse than what we see
well let me put it this way
it's yet to have gotten worse than we
have seen this week in politics at least
in this
in you know the past couple of decades i
think it's um i think we're going to see
it get worse
uh so ben dixon uh appreciate your time

that there's no reason
why reasonable people across the divide
can't all agree with this
psych the alpha males
there doesn't a little part of you think
that america deserves to be taken over
by jihadists
keep it at 100.
things i do for the bigger game plan by
the way it's my birthday
happy birthday to me boy i have a
thought experiment for you
and the alpha males are back back
africans
are black black alpha males are back
someone needs to pay the price for
blasphemy around here
i am a total
we're back michael are you done
oh my god that was just for you sam oh
well thank you
um we are back it's the fun half ladies
and gentlemen six four six two five
seven thirty nine
twenty uh before we go to the
phones um
well before we go to the phones uh
omar uh illanomar came back to um
minneapolis airport was this last night
i guess yes
and um
this is uh good to see here she is
um that's good to see uh it's
encouraging
it's great yep um
here's let's just hear her um she spoke
um in the wake of
donald trump's attacks and there's you
know there's genuine concern
about her safety the safety of
the members of the squad frankly there
there should be concern about
i mean throughout the country but uh
here she is
hello
it sure feels good to be home
they said they said send her back they
didn't know i was already going back
so everybody talks about how
he is threatened because we criticize
him
but the reality is he is threatened
because we are
inspiring people to dream about a
country
that recognizes their dignity and their
humanity
we are pushing for a government that
takes care
of its sick of its most vulnerable which
are its children
and its elderly we are pushing
for a government and a country that
recognizes
that we are all one
that what i gain is a game for my sister
and for
my brother
[Applause]
we have always been about creating a
more
perfect union an inclusive one
one that is not just tolerant but
accepting
[Applause]
and so since the first day this
president
introduced the muslim ban knowing that
mike
the country i came from was on that and
that my country now
was on the track of implementing fascist
laws i knew that i had to speak up
[Applause]
because hope lies hope lies in the
dreams of every immigrant who is able to
achieve that american dream
hope lies in every child that is able to
achieve its full potential
hope lies in every student that achieves
an education and has a regular pathway
to success
hope lies in our constant renewal
and so when i said i was the hope
of the united states is because i embody
what that hope should look like
and when i said i was the president's
nightmare well you're watching it now
because his nightmare is seeing a somali
immigrant refugee
rise to congress
nightmare is seeing the beautiful mosaic
fabric of our country welcome
someone like me as their member of
congress home
to minnesota
and so we are going to continue to
create that hope
we have your back
and we are continue we are going to
continue to be a nightmare to this
president
because it's policy because his policies
are a nightmare to us
and we are not deterred we are not
frightened
we are ready
we are in the ring we are in the
people's house and we are going to
continue to keep fighting
until we have the america we know we all
deserve thank you
geez she's obviously
has for a very long time been by far my
favorite member of the house
and i mean that's just such an important
reminder here too of like getting back
to the fact that this like
she has done more for most of the idiots
in trump's crowd
than he's done i mean in fact he works
against them if we're talking about the
economic policies
i mean while this was happening just
this week she and sanders have a new uh
push against amazon uh in their factory
conditions
she's the co-sponsor on the debt relief
bill
medicare for all and 11 first responders
911 first responders which is which is
you know
stunning of course because one would
think she would have a different view of
that
from all of i shouldn't even make that
joke i mean the lies about her are just
so grotesque and
she's like that's it
firm grounds of anti-racism but also
it's a positive affirmative
shared civic space and then let's go
achieve common goals
it i mean it's people have no idea how
lucky they are to have that kind of
leadership now
it is i mean let's just for a moment
like just to contemplate
the idea that rand paul was uh
pushing for the 911 compensation fund
and ilano mar was the one who was
holding it up
right like i mean right what like like
they would they would they would they
would be sending
police squads to the hill they would be
uh attempting to arrest her if she had
and um the
there is nothing more disgusting this is
like one of the few times where i wish
like the
the jews had a pope so the pope could
come out and say like hey
incidentally all of you who are trying
to leverage the jews
in this way you're disgusting and you're
all
if you're jewish you're excommunicated
and if you're not just
you know i'm the pope of the jews 100
um i mean it's it's really been
grotesque
and anybody look i always have to say
just you know chuck schumer steny hoyer
and nancy pelosi not only did not have
her back in the first wave a couple of
months ago that's right
they went to aipac and co-signed on lies
about her
and they and and uh that editor at the
forward i can never remember her name
but she's
constantly trying to drum things up
against elon
you they share a role in this it's
disgusting not only do they share a role
i mean
from a from a moral perspective all
right let's just step back from that
sure but from a political perspective
strategically they open the door
strategically well they open the door
but let's remember
not only did they open the door to this
because they
um they they sort of capitulated with
their narrative
they stepped all over their uh big roll
out of their
big signature bill hr1
and i don't know if people remember this
but they had they had this uh house
resolution one
was a massive anti-corruption bill it
it across the board uh it got money out
of politics i mean it's just
it would be an impressive piece of
legislation it did not get uh
five minutes of news coverage because
the democrats
uh opened the door nancy pelosi
etc to um to this criticism of
illanomar and uh they tried to exploit
it they got
they lost that internal battle and they
lost much of their agenda because they
signed on to it
and yet they will not learn that lesson
and frankly you know i've been surprised
that there's not
more there's not more been written about
this
because that was there that you know on
day not quite day one but week one
week two they completely dropped the
ball for their agenda
even on their own terms well that's the
lesson with all of these people where
gone are the days of i disagree with
them maybe
like vehemently but they have some sort
of ruthless efficacy and narrow
political games these people don't have
that
and i also just want to say from the
social media perspective
i just want to reiterate that if a
politician or journalist or think tank
person
is saying you know if they put out the i
condemn the president's xenophobia blah
blah blah
it has to mention her name specifically
you have to have the specific stake of
how this is being weaponized against a
specific person because as
medi hassan tweeted yesterday or the day
before
in his words they're trying to kill her
uh you need to be
very clear about who this is centered on
um and how stuff like this
is responded to is also important here's
marco rubio
and um here's marco rubio trying to
pretend like he's above the fray in some
way
and this is this is i mean watch this
because this is going to be
how the republican party if donald trump
ever goes away
eventually he will i got to imagine but
i don't know
uh if donald trump ever goes away in
some fashion
because you know look even if he
loses the election and even if
he peacefully leaves and even if
he is not sent to jail
he's still going to go out and start
some
uh media enterprise that uh
will keep his um you know keep this
energy alive they're gonna
pro you know there's there's that much
more uh to exploit
at that point and understand too that
if he um you know leaves the white house
and then uh
you know croaks because of a massive
heart attack you still got the trump
kids who are going to exploit the hell
out of this too jesus
yeah but here's marco rubio basically
doing a dry run on how he's going to uh
you know lead the republican party out
of uh this quagmire
maybe someday so here's how this has
been working the president says
something and people cringe
you don't like it but then the other
side these left-wing politicians people
on the media
they go crazy with their outrage and
you're and they demand that you
immediately answer what he said and
answer
it the way they want you to answer it
and so here's what you're reminded of
these are the same people that said
reagan was a racist because of
he was in favor of welfare reform george
w bush was a racist because of the way
he
now reagan was a racist because he does
the exact same thing
that donald trump does just in much
more uh like couched language
he was a racist because he made up lies
about so-called welfare queens
and he announced his candidacy we all
know this is it right in
the state and it's in the county and
yeah where civil rights workers were
murdered and he talked about
states rights that's why he was a racist
continue he responded to katrina
and john mccain they even accused him of
being like george wallace
they allowed him to be attacked for that
and and
rob let me remind you why they did that
because he voted
against uh making martin luther king day
a holiday
god they said he was a country club
racist
because in a speech somewhere he said
that if you want free stuff vote for
obama
and so these are the same people by the
way that one of their members of
congress
from their party says that support for
israel is all about the benjamins
and they couldn't even pass a resolution
condemning anti-semitism by itself
but it took him less than 72 hours to
pass a resolution
condemning the president of the united
states tweet as racist
and even in the media obama says we
can't let people across the border
and nobody says anything a republican
says it and it's white nationalism
so the hypocrisy the self-righteousness
outrages people too
and on top of it you have these four
members who are americans no one should
question that they are fully as american
as me or anybody else
but they're also political bullies they
go around attacking people calling other
democrats just like
southern segregationists but when you
hit them back it's because they're
women of color and and and so they hold
a press conference saying we shouldn't
be talking and dividing people on the
basis of race or ethnicity
but then they go on to say by the way if
you disagree with us you're a white
nationalist and you're a racist
so it's absurd people are tired of this
game you have to
immediately respond pick a side between
these two it's a game i'm not going to
play
it's distracting us from the important
things that this country needs to be
focused on
and i'm not playing this game anymore
like he's
that is the most gutless version of
trying to look like you have balls i've
ever seen in my life
you know what i'm gonna do i'm not gonna
take a stake in anything how about that
that is the equivalent of the ted cruz
like listen to me
donald trump you don't call my wife
those things
and will i support him i
said he's horrible i'll support him yeah
first of all whole bunch of racist
isn't racist second of all
uh lie about elon and that's not cool
with donald trump i just
i want to address this because this
keeps coming up this is the big
this is the leveraging of anti-semitism
by uh guys like marco rubio
there are two comments that alan o'mar
made
that get that that basically have
morphed into anti-semitism
one is that the reason why these people
specific lawmakers were supporting
uh and voting in favor of you know
extended rights uh
for uh israel in the context of our
uh our our political system all about
the benjamins
which is identical what thomas friedman
said
about uh support from israel coming in
and money coming in from aipac
identical slightly different uh thomas
friedman was more explicit
but identical the other thing is
when alan omar supposedly
claimed that people had dual loyalty or
that jews had dual loyalty
she was responding to a bill that marco
rubio
was introducing on a federal level to
mimic
a bill that exists in 27 states around
the country
where if you are a contractor and are
doing business with the state
if you're giving for instance this was a
case in texas speech therapy to kids
in classes and you're hired to go in and
provide speech therapy
the state of texas makes you sign a
pledge
that you will not participate in any
protests or boycotts
against israel as an individual
and so she said i'm not going to sign a
loyalty pledge
which is exactly the legislation that
marco rubio was introducing
on a federal level that nobody doing
business with the u.s
government can participate in a boycott
of israel that's just absurd regardless
of whether you think israel should be
boycotted or not
the idea we don't have such pledges
against saudi arabia we didn't have it
against south
africa we didn't have it against england
so it's nothing to do with the country
or what
the idea that fellow contractors would
have to sign
a pledge the idea that state contractors
have to sign a pledge
to not protest anybody they gonna do
this with sean hannity next too
it's just absurd i mean i just this is
i you know again i just wish there was a
jew pope
somewhere but apparently there's not but
uh available
uh let's go to a 308 area code who's
this where you calling from
hey this is kowalski from nebraska
kowalski from nebraska what's on your
mind
called in last week and i had two
questions
there you only had time for the short
one so i was curious if you had a decent
amount of time for a bit of a lengthy
question
well go ahead it's uh early in the calls
go ahead
all right so uh i have a
policy idea and just for some background
information i am
in politics i plan on being a republican
primary challenger this coming spring
i kind of like a liberal perspective on
an idea
okay so i see
uh some pretty big issues that are going
to be coming towards
the heartland which i would classify as
like the great plains
the midwest maybe excluding texas but uh
basically they are self-driving cars
electric vehicles and speed alternatives
and these are all pretty important
because transportation is you know
pretty big for our labor force
self-driving vehicles
you know disrupt that pretty severely
plus it might start taking over
agricultural equipment which could lead
to more corporatization of the whole
industry
uh electric cars may not seem like a big
issue but
uh in like five to ten years projections
show that
maybe about half of all automobiles in
the u.s will be that so
that'll likely kill the ethanol industry
which is
60 of our corn demand which would you
know
just devastate farm operations
and then the last one are meat
alternatives where you either have uh
you know like the veggie burgers and
whatnot or you can even have like
lab grown meats and they're all of equal
or better quality than traditional
meats and then they have fewer inputs
so just economics there's no way we're
gonna be able to feed any of that over
the next
five to ten years so my solution
for it is basically to gear all of
agriculture
that wouldn't be necessary for food
production
towards fighting climate change with
carbon sequestering
i mean um i think that
i mean that you know without knowing the
details broadly speaking that sounds
like a good um
uh a good idea i mean i personally think
that the green new deal
um and i don't think it has
i see it as a way of building on the
green new deal the green shield is kind
of like a big
outline this should be like a piece of
it
and the reason i think it's a good idea
is because i'm not trying to start
something i want to build on existing
momentum
yeah i mean i
if you're asking me as a um
is it a good idea from a policy
standpoint i would say
yes i mean the fact of the matter is
cutting down on meat consumption
uh and meat production it would go ah
is is i i mean more or less essential
frankly um and
in in fighting climate change and well
if not that we'll be cutting down on it
one thing i've noticed is that you
cannot do
anything that is going to reduce
someone's standards of living
i see it as people are going to find an
alternative around it
i i think stem cell growth meat is
probably going to dominate the market
just because the inputs will be so much
lower and it's essentially feel quality
in a controlled environment you can
never have to worry about the disease
yeah but i mean cutting down on the
production
of the meat as we as we have it now let
me put it that way
okay i mean how we will get around it
how how how the culture will change
uh is is is is a sort of like a parallel
track
and i agree with you i think that um you
know a combination of
of like sort of like advances in
vegetarian replacements
and advances in um
in in laboratory i mean i think for the
first five years people are going to be
like ooh
yuck and then within six years everybody
forgets about it and that's the way that
we
eat yeah a lot of people don't really
understand how disgusting it is to
actually
butcher an animal so exactly
exactly exactly i would argue uh far
more disgusting
and um if people really want to um get a
look at that watch uh frederick
wiseman's uh meet i think it's called
it's a extended documentary
and uh you walk out there a little bit
shaken but yeah no i think it's a i
think
i think well there is a second half to
this whole policy that
is part of the carbon sequestering which
i think is actually the part that i
wanted to run by you guys because
it's either brilliant or absolutely
crazy
so uh basically what i want to do
is have everybody on because if there's
no more
need to grow meat that means all range
land is now opened up
like it is pointless but 10 000 your
occupation of being a
shepherd is over so that would free up a
lot of land
to you know grow more for i want to grow
high volume forage crops bail them up
take them down
to the coastal areas and build up
major marshlands because that provides
protections from uh storm surges which
cost us like 50 billion dollars a year
and there's pretty much no way to stop
the thermal expansion of the oceans at
this point
so in the future hurricanes should
become less frequent more violent
bigger storm surges so if we
are using all of this material
which 95 of all dry plant matter is
simply carbon from the atmosphere
so if we're dumping all of that into the
ocean putting sediment on top of it
building up a wildlife refuge on the top
of that it shields our
coastal areas from storm surges you're
sequestering the carbon somewhere it
cannot be composed
and you know you just be constantly
feeding a defense
while also you know saving money from
you know
damage i mean i
i you know i'm not frankly sophisticated
enough in these topics to know whether
that's a
um a you know feasible
i mean it sounds like um it sounds like
a
number the transportation could be a
nightmare though
right right and i would imagine also
you're going to have a problem i mean i
don't know
specifically where you are but in terms
of flooding um
there needs to be um you're going to
need to
you know it's going to be interesting to
see like what what the implications for
flooding will be
when we ultimately achieve what you're
talking about but i will say this
that as a um from a campaign perspective
i would not run on this i i mean i just
think that i think
i think i i think like this would be a
um
uh you know uh i i think you you need to
run
if you're running and i presume you're
running in the republican party because
your ideas don't sound particularly
republican to me
but if you're you're running in the
republican party because it's uh
it's an easier road to hoe great but i
would keep it down to
saying um i i would simplify it all
as to like we need to address the plight
of farmers and uh
that's kind of the whole point behind it
is that uh
basically everything i just explained to
you to somebody here would actually
pretty much make themselves because
uh nobody's thinking of this disruptive
technology coming our way
like i'm looking at this from somebody
who you know has studied
agribusiness can kind of see where
trends are going
and there's like
no way this doesn't destroy the family
farm
increase corporate farms and just
completely reckless
and if that happens then the crazies
come out
i i listen i think it's a good idea to
talk about the things that threaten
farmers
i think it's a good idea to talk about
the things that uh that that
that could bring about more
corporatization amongst farms
i just wouldn't get so uh frankly
so granular in your uh plans i mean if
people want to hear them and they want
to sit down but i wouldn't
i would just talk about broadly speaking
we need to start thinking about support
for
farmers we need to do that whether it's
in
fighting climate change or whether it is
in retraining
or whether it is in finding um other
uh professions that work with the land
that um
can uh you know um uh be
uh you know that can that can be turned
to other productive uses
i think a dr acknowledging
and pointing out potential
um threats to people's way of life
whether it's you know and this is why
people say like social security is in
crisis
because the implication is that i see
that social security is in crisis
i will have a plan for it even if it's
not and in this instance
i think this way of life is in crisis
and frankly uh you know
there's a lot of things that are going
to be affecting people in rural areas
broadly speaking so
i mean i think that's a good idea i just
wouldn't i wouldn't start introducing
those plans until you get into congress
good luck with it i appreciate the call
uh what i would do
is tell say that your opponent has small
hands
and we all know what that means because
you rather get a republican primary
right and climate's happening because
the jews built a space machine
that's just my advice not normative
we have so many
um callers on the line it's unbelievable
we no longer no longer puts numbers on
there so i can't tell you but i think
it's like 50 callers
uh and this guy got in on the wire
calling from a 509 area code who's this
where you calling from
hey sam it's ronald reagan ronald reagan
i thought it was you
yeah you got uh you really jumped right
in there
clients must be waiting in the uh
waiting room
right on top of it today um well
um i've got kind of a serious call if
you don't mind um
i'm a big fan of the show but i wanted
to share with you a couple of
uncomfortable epiphanies that i've had
recently
if you don't mind sure okay
so uh first i was uh recently listening
to one of your shows
you were talking about mass
incarceration and the sort of
systemic racism in our criminal justice
system
and as you were sort of talking through
some of the issues i was
overcome with this a feeling that i'd
like to kind of try and describe if i
can
first it was like a
overwhelming sense of sadness about the
situation
grief i guess you could say for the
people affected
and their families and their communities
and
that was quickly followed with sort of a
thick layer of
panic almost like a sense that
my inaction or even my lack of education
um made me in some way complicit
in this sort of social meat grinder that
we've
constructed and so i i started to feel
another
thing which was like a resolve to
like do something about it like even
something small but just to
dedicate myself to to doing something
about this problem and
and uh just as this resolve was
coming up against that other feeling
that
guilt that sort of guilty panic in the
back of my
gut just as these two things were coming
to collide um i realized
i've never put handcuffs on anyone
myself
so you it's another oh so so wait so you
didn't want to feel
collectively responsible
as an individual i didn't do that things
because you didn't do that
so you're a little bit scared about that
trend there maybe it's too political
i i just think i don't know why you're
trying to make me feel a certain way if
i didn't
directly take a person into the jail
myself and then lock the door i have
nothing to do with it and that's what
the left
wants this kid died in ice custody
people are being arrested and imprisoned
for insane amounts of time for whatever
reason and whatnot
you didn't do that but the left wants
you to feel guilty instead of talk about
ideas and play video games
i really think there's something to that
i really do
the other thing is that you know things
things things things are either
good or bad and
ending i've noticed that you like to
complain about a lot of different things
and and the suggestion is that things
are bad but in your analysis you never
consider that
things for me ronald reagan are actually
pretty good
right and if right things aren't good
for me objective
you're saying well it's just like
if things are good for me then like
what i mean it seems like things are
good then
and especially if if i hand-picked
a selection of people from a hundred
years ago
who who for for whom things were not as
good
as they are for me now then i think that
uh frankly you're overreacting to all of
these different things like climate
change or whatever
well how do you know i mean i understand
your first point your first point is
like
we can only feel guilty for things that
we
are directly involved in right
not um for what our society does
not for what our community does not for
what our government
does as long as we're not directly
involved in something we don't need to
feel
any guilt and in fact feeling guilt for
those things
is detrimental uh because then it causes
you to sometimes do
more of those things right like if
you're going to
blame me it's mostly it's mostly that
that feeling that i described earlier i
didn't like it
that's the problem you know but but it
goes further than that because it's not
just that you don't like it and you fee
it makes you feel uncomfortable
but if you're going to make me feel bad
for the carceral state that that i
support with taxes or support because
i'm a member
a citizen then maybe
i'm just gonna say well to hell with it
if i already feel bad about it
i might as well go out and
cuff people or search them or do stop
and frisk right like it may actually
make me do that more
because i'm already paying for it i
might as well get the
the the you know i might as well get a
chance to do it and then well they do
the crimes though mostly or or nil
all right and then the other thing
you're saying but
but here's the problem with the second
thing that you're saying um around right
here
um because in years from now
when uh we uh when you know
capitalism figures out how to turn
climate change
into uh the propulsion mechanism for jet
packs
people are going to look like when
competition kicks in when competition
kicks in for the jet packs
people going to look back on us now and
feel bad for us
because we didn't have the ability to
jet pack around and
that's when things would be much worse
if i was responsible
if i was responsible for my grandpa not
having an iphone i'd really feel
really bad about it but it wasn't my
fault
steve jobs wasn't born yet and so then
you think about in a completely
different way i really think there's a
lot to this
there's a lot to this and you know my
ancestors came over on a boat
and then they walked across the plains
they were early mormon converts and now
i would just
 fly right so
seems like uh seems like we're good
and i don't know frankly why i'm giving
money every
month to some show that wants to
pretend like there's a bunch of problems
if like i've got a good job
and uh you know wait a minute wait a
second well well
if you take his money away insurance
then he will
be you will actually be directly making
him feel bad and that is your
responsibility
that's true
i think you just got owned no i think
you just got owned
um okay all right appreciate that all
right
all right you're welcome all right
bye-bye
column from a uh 469 area code who's
this where you calling from
469. hello
hello can you hear me
yes can you hear me yeah i can hear you
now sorry
uh i got a comment on the question first
uh the comment is

ah okay garlic
okay that yeah kind of cemented
everything just all over again
point number two is uh yesterday michael
talked about this on a show
on the difference being this being an
election of mobilization rather than
an election of persuasion yeah so do you
think
with that in mind do we still i mean do
you think we still need to
sort of uh appeal to the moderates
or like whatever moderates maybe in the
purple states for example
to keep hold of the senate especially
rather than
you know just focusing on the presidency
i mean i think in the context of
in the context of like senate races in
texas let's say
um i think there's a different strategy
that you would have than maybe a
national strategy
and you would see those two strategies
working
so for instance if you go to a
mobilization strategy
and uh the vote now a presidential
campaign's not going to spend
too many resources in texas although at
this point
it may be worth their while if there is
a sense that
it would force the republican candidate
to defend it
and the mobilization that would come
from the infrastructure of a
presidential campaign
mixed with a a a you know a more
localized candidate
in texas running for senate is one thing
but but but from a national perspective
the key has to be
bring out voters who
wouldn't otherwise vote right now
there's a lot of data that suggests
that at this point in the cycle the
attention that people are paying to the
election is at an all-time high both
in the republican party and the
democratic party there are simply more
democrats than there are
republicans it is just a question of can
you mobilize them
and donald trump
if donald trump hasn't persuaded you to
vote against him yet
at this point then nothing's going to
happen the key is
mobilizing voters on the left
who don't like donald trump and unless
they feel
across the board that you're giving them
something different
they won't come out and vote now
it's maybe seven eights maybe 15
16 maybe 31 30 seconds
maybe 63 of the 64th
of uh democratic voters will come out
but i would say that um
hillary clinton lost because one
you know only 127 of 128
came out and voted for her like you need
to mobilize
the largest spectrum of people on the
left
and if you're in the center you're going
to vote you're going to come out and
vote
and i mean i think like you know when
people say that there is going to be
um you know centrists who
democrats who would vote against uh
bernie sanders i think that's possible
i think it's possible but you're not
gonna if you're a centrist who votes
you're gonna come out and vote in this
election because those people
vote for the senate and the house and
then they're going to be looking at that
ballot and they're going to see
would i vote for sanders or for um
uh trump so i think they're going to
pull that so they will end up voting for
sanders i think
i think so like i do i mean the
totally irrational and bizarre hatred
for sanders is in high gear right now
but it's like
there isn't i mean i guess a handful of
these people could vote for howard
schultz but it's like
who are they going to vote for i guess
some of them could leave the ballot
blank
right right but the people who would not
vote for joe biden
they're just not going to vote they're
just knocking it's going to be much
easier for them not to vote for joe
biden because they're not going to show
up
at you know and actually pull lever for
anybody
they're just going to be disaffected and
they're going to stay home and so
i mean that's that's my my sense of that
but that's why we say it's a
mobilization and and frankly
that's certainly trump's strategy it is
tom
trump's strategy and it's also looking
to me like i'm not
sure it looks to me like he's already
walked back disavowing the uh
the chant of course of course yeah it's
just amazing we know it's a matter of
time
right uh let's play that clip though um
this is donald trump
meeting with yazidis in the white house
now understand the yazidis were um
during the obama years were uh
were under siege by isis they
apparently their their struggles did not
end
with isis but the trump administration
brought them in
to praise donald trump for getting rid
of isis
it didn't quite work out in the way that
donald trump wanted it to
and if you want to um see an example
of a human being who cannot be moved
emotionally who's so detached from other
human
beings that they cannot be moved by real
literally
anything that doesn't directly involve
them watch this clip
it is stunning i mean if you combine
this clip well
watch this clip vice president he helped
us a lot but now today you
you can solve our problem now there's no
isis but we cannot
go back because kurdish government and
the iraqi government they are fighting
each other who will control
my area and we can not go back if we
cannot
protect our dignity our our
family and but we we get a lot of
support from
president macron he pushed he put a lot
of pressure in iraqi and kurdistan
government to
to help minorities the ecd to stay in
their home but
we still continue to immigrate to find a
safe place to live i i hope you can
call or anything to iraqi and kurdistan
government to but isis is gone
but if i if right now it's kurdish and
iraqi
iraqi government if i cannot go to my
home and
live in a safe place and
get my like my dignity back this it's
not about isis it's about i'm in
dangerous my people cannot go back
we are not millions of people we are
only half million people
and after 2014 about 95
years 95 000 years ago they immigrate to
germany through a very dangerous way
not because we want to be a refugees but
but we cannot find a safe place to live
all this happened to me they killed my
mom my sixth brother they left behind
them where are they now
they killed them they are in the mass
graves in sinjar
and i'm still fighting just to live
in safe please do something and
it's not about one family i know the
area very well it's
it's about half million it's about the
whole community
okay
yeah that's incredible they gave it to
you for what reason we
can explain for what reason for that
after all this happened to me i didn't
give up i
can i i make it clear to everyone that
i served thousands of yezidi women this
one
was first time the woman from iraq she
get
out and spoke about that happened oh
really is that right
it's the first time and it's so you
escaped i
escaped but i i don't i i don't have my
freedom yet because
you you you didn't see any isis in court
isis are we don't know if they killed
every
everyone if they are in in
jail but we know we have three thousand
yacd women and children
including my niece my nephew my
sister-in-law
three years ago she called us she said
i'm in syria and now we didn't know
anything about it
let me look we'll look okay thank you
very much
i i mean jesus christ right
i mean i jesus christ i mean that's
it i think what is so
frankly there's a fair amount of
sociopaths i would assume
in political space but it's like the
inability to even like
protect the understanding that this is
the time
especially frankly because i and i just
i'm i i
hate that i would even have to like go
this cynically here but it's like
the yazidis were facing genocide that's
absolutely true
and part of the reason they mobilized
some support amongst people who
typically
absolutely don't care about the
well-being of anybody in the middle east
is because they're christian
so it's like he there's a lot of reasons
for him to pretend to care about this
woman
and he just no i mean the only thing
he's kind of interested in
is like you have a nobel prize that's
prestigious that's like obama
i want one of those yes it's on oh jesus
man
wow i i don't they're not
christian uh yezidis they're they're
there's some similarity but they're
they're yazidis
um i don't i don't believe
they're they're they're they're
christian but nevertheless
um they
they oh you're yeah you're right the
the inability it's like he's like a
sociopath
who has also grown up in a closet
like like literally was not allowed to
go outside because
he does not even
he obviously does not care about
these people at all he can't even
pretend to care he doesn't even know how
you would act
if you did care all he cared about was
the nobel prize i know the area very
well
who is it between the kurdish and the
who
i don't think he had even a clue as to
where
[Music]
i mean if you take
the the those three clips of this week
mike pence overseeing the cage full
of human beings donald trump
prancing around on stage as
his minions cheer send her back and that
last one which is supposed to be the one
that shows that he cares about people
who are not white
right that's why they brought those
people in there
uh and it and it's it's of course it's
it's meant for
his um supporters
to remind them that they're not really
racist that's the idea there
right and it's
it's stunning and the thing is is that
it will not make a difference
you could show that video clip i think
to everyone in the country
and it would not make a difference in
terms of where people are
dispositionally about donald trump do
you think of the future that those
uh sort of sensitivity perceptions are
completely blown out and can't be
brought back in with like subtlety or
does it just not matter i just don't
think that people i think that people
uh you know that's what that's i mean
that
it gets back to the call that uh
reminded us to play that clip
this is a mobilization election
where it's a mobilization society that's
basically it and frankly it's been like
this
for several decades at least
the um i think in
uh in fubar we're writing about uh
uh conservatives 10 12 years ago
i mean i would describe these people as
uh the conservative
movement as you know uh being like
they're in masada
you know the story of masada was the
basically
um it was like the alamo for
a group of uh of hebrews
and they were under siege for an
extended period of time they eventually
i think they all
um they may have committed suicide
or they were because they had basically
were cut off from food
but this idea that they're under siege
these this mentality of conservatives
they're under siege from 15 years ago it
was from gays
uh they're under siege from women
they're under siege from black people
they're under siege from brown people
um they're under siege from you know
feminazis and
um and the liberals
their way of life is constantly
threatened
and they are mobilized which is why they
have done
traditionally much better in off-year
elections
and the left has to this is a
mobilization
election you can do both mobilize and
persuade
but there is got to be an emphasis
because the fact of the matter is we
have a very polarized country
and like i say
i mean i don't think
you know subtlety is going to make a
material difference
let's play something that's at least
somewhat amusing
um
alan dershowitz as you know is um
but uh trigger warning of the oh yeah
just uh just basic human law
i would say trigger warning for everyone
literally everyone know like what
sensitivities you need to have
someone who's not into trigger warnings
i will say this is a universal trigger
warning
um so alan dershowitz as you know
is in some respects implicated in um
the jeffrey epstein saga
they were friends i think at one point
dershowitz may have represented him
in some fashion he represented him in
the last case
um apparently uh
derchowicz is very upset because he's
been implicated
supposedly allegedly um
by a victim and
dershowitz is going to make it all about
the lawyer david boyes and here he is on
laura ingram's show
making the case is he going after me
i have to tell you i have a theory i
think he's projecting david boyce has a
terrible reputation for
sexual activities and i've issued a
challenge to him look
i've had sex with one woman since the
day i met jeffrey epstein
i challenged david boyes to say under
oath that he's only had sex with one
woman during that same period of time he
couldn't do it
so he has an enormous amount of chutzpah
to attack
me and to challenge my perfect
perfect sex life during the relevant
period of time
he's doing it for money he claims he's
doing this
she always came first i maintained the
perfect amount of eye contact
and it was a perfect fusion of of
lustful abound
and sensitivity and i challenged david
boyes
to match that people talk about trump
derangement system but like this is the
way his language has seeped into all of
our brains
could you imagine alan yeah my perfect
perfect sexual record
perfect perfect sexual record
the the idea that this is you know sort
of
about you know that it's like
part of his sex life part of my sex life
was just you know
to um take these women who are
trafficked
uh these girls who are trafficked
like i don't know it's a weird con
construction just so they say that's
part of my sex life there was and david
boyce i asked david boyce if he switched
positions or
one wrote method without any attention
to his partners
mine was perfect dude that to me sounds
like a veiled threat
i don't think there was any veiling
about it
it was not a veil that was that was very
clear
um nuts
perfect i was a 10 of 10. and i have
dreams at night that the olympic judges
give me the perfect scores
let's go to go to the phones call them
from a 510
area code who's this where you calling
from
uh is this me am i on yes you are who's
this where you calling from
okay this is james i'm from uh hudson
new york or that's where i'm living now
okay hudson new york i know it well
oh great um yeah so i was calling i'm
gonna
watch a lot of the show and um sort of
tuned into the tenor that the kind of
the
the sort of itchiness of the warren
sanders difference
uh is happening and i'm kind of like i
want one of them to win
the primary basically i'm like i just
need
so i guess my my question is because i
had some urge to
to defend warren a little against uh
mike but i think that my my main feeling
is
i wanted to know like
there is this difference between the
warren sanders voters and like
if it comes down to warren sanders
harris or warren sanders by
biden is there a coalition or is there a
way that a coalition can be formed
either behind sanders or behind warren
and like
i don't know like what is the what is
your feeling about the strategy there
i i my guess is
that in the event that it comes down to
three people like that
we're gonna see it play out in the
convention
i mean it really depends on who the
three people are to a certain extent
um i don't know how that gets resolved
between
warren and sanders voters um
because i do i definitely think that
they
the the polling shows that they are
distinct entities
and there's not as much crossover as you
would imagine
based upon their policy sets i i would
i would guess you know i think it's just
too early
to sort of say how people are going to
react
and it's also too early i think um
because i think you need to see more in
the debates to see
if uh uh
warren or sanders can convince the other
voters that they are their number
two right can i i just want to just say
i mean
you know look i i don't i
i'm gonna you know i i think that i
treat
uh warren fairly and i obviously am not
going to pretend that i
again to me it is i i just think it's
it's not even a difference of one being
better than the other it's just a
different kind of candidate rep
and bernie represents a certain kind of
class
politics and then if you include you
know foreign and military policy which i
think
yes we can say all day people don't care
about it but it's utterly reckless and
narcissistic for americans not to care
about it on some level frankly and i'll
make that as a hard stop statement
uh but yeah so i i think it i think
what's been interesting to me though is
i think in
in the narrower conversations of people
who are like very high information news
consumers like
like you you that this debate is pretty
relevant and there are people bouncing
in between warren and sanders
but i think as sam is saying you know a
lot of the polling indicates
that there's a lot more like sanders to
biden or biden to sanders as an example
and i don't read that necessarily as
people not caring about ideology to the
same degree that sam might i also read
it as
basically in some respects a
manifestation that as an example that
you know
sanders support right now is much more
uh
frankly of a much broad class base
and i think the simplicity of the
message and the clarity of it is
very distinct and very beneficial but i
i mean
i i but i guess the bigger point is i
guess i don't think
criticizing candidates one way or
another is is uh something you need to
worry about right now
um the definitely i guess my my
sorry let me just let me just comment on
what michael said then you can go
the um to the extent that there is a
um a
e you may be making a class but it's a
cultural thing that it to the extent
that uh
sanders and biden share um uh voters
from the same class
they're not doing a marxist critique and
it's bringing them to biden
marxist there are cultural there are
what
cultural things do you think those are i
don't think it's just culture
i think it's their i think it's their
uh i think it has to do with sort of
like maleness
you think that but wait so wait wait but
that doesn't make any sense
because we both know that if you cut it
across
classline no because as a matter of fact
bernie's coalition is significantly more
diverse
than warren i understand but i don't
know i don't i agree
i'm saying the crossover the people who
share who want biden
number two who and it's not it's not
even the majority of
of of of bernie voters but is the
plurality of of
of bernie voters i think that they are
responding
to cultural cues the joe
biden you know amtrak joe that well
those i think the
truth responding to use overlap with
classic
use frankly if you want to use that
language no but i'll just be anecdotal
because this is what i think what's
going on
so my grandmother as an example she's
bernie or biden
she supports universal health care she
has a labor union background
and bernie has gotten through to her as
somebody who actually represents
more of a continuation of of good solid
labor politics
and then she just happens to like biden
and doesn't by the way perceive him to
be as
bad on those issues as i'm telling her
but it's not because she's like
oh well you know he's a dude and she's
not drawing
that warren dude it's because she's not
drawing
he he has all the cultural cues
of someone who is labor
yeah right okay but then we're sort of
saying a similar thing then and i
wouldn't necessarily frame that as just
quote-unquote cultural right like you
know just as
because the cultural cues are queuing
for
cares about working people and has a
labor agenda
whereas you know in in warren's case
she and i think it's important for
people to reference this outside of
these circles
she doesn't find all of the like endless
wonkery to be
interesting or impressive and i think
the irony is that
elizabeth warren cares a lot more about
work uh
less people right then absolutely but
that but i
that one i completely agree with you on
but it's not uh
you know it's not a social conservatism
or maleness that is driving her
well i am not convinced that those
things
are not also
these things are all bound up in ways
you know in part on how like they're
represented within the context of
american society
people when they think about unions i
think broadly
speaking americans when they think about
a typical union member
they look at they they picture in their
mind a guy
even though the case of the matter the
fact of the matter is that like
uh this is somebody whole life
who also likes hillary clinton yeah so i
mean i don't i don't know if i want to
you know
go ask him psychobabble it's not a great
your grandma
to describe a typical union member i'd
be curious as to what uh gender they
they they they just well she would
suppose let's hear the column
okay caller are you there
yeah somebody else i don't see
she might i don't think so what's up
i might still go ahead call it yes go
ahead
oh anyway well i think i'll i'll take
the rest of my
stuff off there but i think it's funny
because my family is sort of the
opposite where you know i was on
vacation and i was convincing my aunt my
mom and telling him all about the hyde
amendment and kind of
biden's campaigning for these sort of
very uh these like you know basically
kind of anti-abortion uh
or you know pro-choice all right
pro-life you know democrats and and all
this and
and i could sort of move the needle to
warren
but i could never you know they when i
said blah blah blah
sanders they kind of would bring up you
know he said about nicaragua
in the 80s or something you know they
that
that stench still hung around and so
oh anyway i just feel like the the you
know the way
michael says about there's people that
just they don't like they don't like
uh sanders and they're not really
convinceable i mean certainly like my
family with this
kind of ivy league background though
they're exactly the demographic of like
warren convinceables
where they will move left from from
harris
or biden to warren but i i can't
for exactly these cultural reasons i
don't know if i can get them to move to
sanders
and i just wonder you know what is them
you know i guess i'm just asking like
what is the map of like
how many you know there's like people
that are sort of standards convincibles
that are and then there's people that
are warring convincibles and of course
then there's the candidate that you
actually
approve of and i don't know i just i've
been wondering all about it
anyway i think okay i appreciate the
call let me just i'll answer it off the
uh affair i mean the the polling
shows that the there is a greater number
of people
like your family who um
who will discount bernie than warren
warren at least uh a month or two ago
had um a slightly higher ceiling
and a but also a lower floor
than bernie it remains to be seen
because
the other thing that may be driving like
sort of bernie and biden
supporters to be shared is that
um people may perceive that
bernie has a better chance of winning
and certainly
i imagine that is why you know bernie's
support amongst
african americans is like three times
that
of warren and
i imagine that comes into play but i
also imagine the idea of like
uh of of just the
the the movement building
that bernie is doing and the involvement
that bernie had
in civil rights movement that warren
did not have i mean
and so i think you're going to be able
to find
people who can move from biden to bernie
and people who can move from biden to
warren and i think
the campaign is going to
sort out to a certain extent
three quarters of
of of the people who will move to one
candidate or another
when that time comes because it's very
conceivable i think
if i had to predict right now i would
say that there's going to be three or
four people
who are going to be in this race well
into the spring
and i would imagine that
warren may be one of them bernie's
certainly going to be one of them
and uh but i think i just i would also
just really encourage people
that if you dig into these polls and i
and
you know and and again talk to like
normal people
that i will use my grandmother in this
instance that
the strengths that he had that
that exactly the dynamic we're
articulating
outside of very narrow but highly over
represented confines in academia and
media
are his strengths and they're going to
be big strengths for normal people
you have to appeal to to actually win
things what do you mean by
like specifically like a simple clear
message
like we're going to just do this without
means testing it a lot of the kind of
elevation of technocracy and wonkery
doesn't necessarily translate as well to
a broader set of people and i also think
that the history of
movement politics is a significant
distinction as well
yeah i agree i mean it i mean i think
the movement thing is
is is a big deal uh but i think
i think you know to a certain extent her
the the details of the plans i don't
think people is what moves people
to to i think it's this perception that
she says
i have a plan right but i'm saying we're
in the phase
now where there's a lot of people
engaging who
fancy themselves sort of like in the
process in a certain way i'm just saying
when you talk to normal people and you
say
one point okay most candidates plans do
nothing about student loans right
one candidate's plans just eliminates
them no no complications no
form no nonsense let's just do it
and the other one it's like well sort of
yes
but then you have to fill out a bunch of
paperwork there that
outside of a pretty narrow set of people
their eyes glaze over and they're less
excited about that general type of
approach
well all right i mean i think i i happen
to agree that we should get rid of
everyone's student debt but saying
we're gonna get rid of everyone's
student debt who makes under
uh a hundred thousand dollars a year is
a fairly straightforward
pitch i i happen to think that we should
just we should get rid of student debt
but i'm
i don't think it's i think we have a lot
of evidence about
what if you go out there it's easier to
communicate
we'll see um i hope
i hope you're right about that um
here is uh rand paul oh god
now it is now passed um i'm not exactly
sure
how they got oh wait you know what let's
talk about dan cranshaw on the minimum
wage
because dan crenshaw wanted to do i
guess he's deciding that he is going to
be the
um this is this is dan crenshaw
basically uh adopting um the stephen
crowley
uh look and dan crenshaw i think thinks
he's he's talking to a bunch of college
students
or maybe maybe dan crenshaw thinks he's
talking to a bunch of high school
students
but here's dan crenshaw coming out and
distorting
the results of the cbo uh findings uh
lying about the polls i mean excuse me
the the studies
on the implications of the minimum wage
on the west coast but let's listen to
this and we'll we'll stop it when
necessary
imagine a scenario a business any
business
and all of a sudden there's a mandatory
minimum
wage increase now some people in this
business make the minimum wage they'll
get a wage increase maybe
some people make a little bit above the
minimum wage some people are managers
but the reality is is that the budget
for salaries
does not change so now there's some
shifting that needs to happen
maybe some hours will change maybe
guess what the budget for
salaries can change the budget for
salaries does not have to be
fixed in fact i run a business and the
budget for salaries is not fixed
it changes changes on how many people i
have on board
it changes how long they've been with
the with the company
it changes and i'm not even in an
industry
where there's some well i guess maybe
there is
you know maybe this industry does have
some slack
when we talk about uh the minimum wage
across the board
we're talking about industries who have
been
benefiting from a rise in productivity
over the past 30 or 40 years
that has not been shared with workers
so these same companies 30 years ago
relative to
the productivity the business they were
doing
a bigger share of that revenue
went to wages so there is some slack too
in the system
so if you imagine that business
uh as crenshaw wants you to also imagine
that
budgets are not written in stone they
change
based upon needs continue
people will actually get a wage increase
but others will
fully lose their jobs so here's the
thing
on the one hand you have some percentage
of a wage increase
on the other you have a 100 percent
decrease
in wages because that's what happens
when you lose your job
this is the essence of the minimum wage
debate okay we're about to vote on this
this week in the us house of
representatives
there's two big problems with the
minimum wage increase to 15
one is the economics of it i just gave
you a little bit of a preview there
the second part is the fact that it is a
one-size-fits-all
policy from the federal level that's
problematic too
but let's talk about the economics for a
second some cities have already tried
this
seattle la san francisco and what we've
seen
is employment has actually decreased in
those
cities many studies backed this up
possibly
yeah that's not true well there's i'm
sure there's some studies
uh but the most recent studies say that
there has not been
significant job loss in any of these
cities
uh that he's talking about people can go
and and and google it um we could talk
about
uh this paper the impact of a city level
minimum wage policy on supermarket food
prices by food quality metrics a two
year follow-up study
the um
we have a study in the quad quarterly
journal of economics by economist at the
university of massachusetts university
of college london
and the economic policy institute data
from 138 cities
than states that raised the minimum wage
between 79 and 2016
does not show significant job loss
a new white paper from anna goody and
michael richard berkeley provides
more evidence well that's actually about
the cbo which is coming up
there's plenty of studies that show
to the contrary seattle san francisco
minimal job loss significant
raise in the
wages of low-end wage workers but
continue you
just did a study on what would happen if
we had a 15 minimum wage and here's what
they found
3.7 million jobs potentially
lost that's right 3.7 million
real income would actually decrease by
39 billion dollars
what does that mean and why well it's
because of purchasing power purchasing
power would go down
[Music]
so the cbo's report said we don't
really know what the job loss could be
it could be zero
or it could be 3.7 million
and so they ended up deciding on 1.3
million
because they don't know we just simply
do not know the answer to this all we
have is the data that suggests what has
happened
and like i said a new white paper from
anna goode and michael wright's at
berkeley
show that the impact on jobs is
insignificant the cbo
which just aggregated
like 11 reports on this ranging from
it will create zero job loss to 3.7
million
uh jobs lost
did not include this report here
which would have probably aggregated the
brought that average number down
so nobody really knows for sure all we
know
is that wages to productivity
if we had kept pace with productivity
the minimum wage would be closer to 21
and it would be 15 at this point and so
we sustained this before and we haven't
since
the only thing that crenshaw is saying
in this video that is has any
legitimate value i think is this notion
of a one-size-fits-all policy could be
problematic
if you take the minimum wage
up to a point where most
cities and states
could not sustain it where there wasn't
enough slack in the system
it's conceivable there are a couple
of low-wage states
i'm thinking states in the south
where you don't have much union density
at all
or right-to-work states where wages are
so low
that people have built businesses
so reliant on exploiting workers
that you could conceivably see some uh
job loss even at 15 an hour
but we won't know until we figure it out
and if that's the case we could amend it
and couldn't we also
subsidize like to me it seems like you
could
clearly create some type of subsidy
system for like oh
i own a bodega let's have a subsidy for
that
and then you know in these other places
even the companies you're talking about
that have built these models out of
low union states or companies like
walmart that certainly could absorb
that absolutely like and should be
compelled to
we just simply don't know um we just
simply don't know
until we do it and so the idea that
you're going to deny people
which we would have were
um where this minimum wage
pegged to productivity increases we'd be
like i say well above 15 an hour at this
point
and because we just don't know to what
extent
where people will spend their money
frankly
you're paying your worker 15 an hour
and if your worker turns around and
spends that extra money
as does his neighbor at your bodega
you're gonna be happy that you paid that
work or that that because
it's not just your worker that's getting
that 15 an hour it's
your workers neighbor who's going to get
extra money in their pocket and they're
going to come down to your store
and and and spend it
and certainly uh subsidies be far better
than than giving tax cuts because you're
subsidizing
people who are going to spend the money
let's go back to the phones
call him from a 585 area code who's this
where you calling from
yeah um hi this is annie khan from
rochester new york i wanted to say you
guys are just
you're singing my song today every
single topic i i called in a long time
ago
before um bernie jumped in and i was
all about warren because i was afraid so
i'm gonna be
honest with that i'm gonna say i was
afraid in the beginning
to go full bearing and uh back bernie
100
before he got in the race because i
thought that he had a tarnished
reputation
because you know the hillary people were
just tearing them down
and that the only way we were going to
get any kind of change was with a more
acceptable
palatable candidate i'm wrong um
but you know so moving on i'm 100
you know for bernie now and i think that
that's for the best and obviously he's
in my opinion the better candidate but
um
i do want to i do want to say one thing
about this dan crenshaw guy so this is
and then i'll just take my i i guess
take the response off here
this guy's an idiot because uh you know
when i go down to a local business
they're working with uh you know one two
people maximum no matter
whatever is going on contractors you
know it's them and their sons
uh you go to a shop on main street it's
just one guy
or one lady and their only hours are
when they're available
personally uh this is happening
everywhere and these places can barely
stay afloat so the very idea that
anyone's being paid
15 an hour to work at a small business
um is is laughable because
even if they i mean like i i'm 100 for
it
so his problem is he doesn't realize
they're already everywhere working with
skeleton crew
if they're doing it at mcdonald's you
know they were bitching because they say
oh
they'll automate they're already gonna
automate because they want to do
the least amount of overhead possible
labor costs the most
so it's completely ridiculous for this
crenshaw guy first of all
he needs to just step back because the
only reason anyone knows who the hell he
is
is because he got made fun of by that
guy in snl
i'll be honest with you and that's
absolutely true i mean you know what i
mean
nobody knows who this dude is and uh it
is
i'm gonna make a little terrible joke
but it is myopic of him
to only have you know one opinion on
this
subject
oh you know what i've been i bet i can't
remember his name he's a funny skinny
guy
um but i bet you he's kicking himself
now for having had to apologize
to that guy because he's a complete jerk
i mean this guy
he took his this is this is what
republicans do all the time they take
that tiny little
insignificant amount of celebrity and
they just like grind it into the ground
until you just can't stand anything
about them anymore well we're going to
have down
for a long time but listen i appreciate
the call thanks annie
let's go to uh 303 area code who's this
where you calling from
hey this is matt calling from colorado
hey matt we got
we got 18 minutes left on the on the
show i want to get a bunch of calls in
so uh
gotta be quick yup super quick i
really just wanted to call and say
thanks it's been a scary week in america
and i was feeling a little panicky
after last trump rally called in
yesterday to the show and michael did a
great job talking me off the ledge
so to speak spend the rest of the day
noticing things that reinforce the
points he was making
about there being more people involved
not just in terms of voter turnout
and also candidates running on better
policies
than ever before so uh then seeing
omar's reception at the end of the day
that was just the icing on the cake so
anyway one to call and say thanks for
not being not not just being the
most informative show out there but also
uh
having a real uh refreshingly realistic
take
on what's actually going on thanks
appreciate it
all right i'm gonna race through these
call from an eight four seven area code
who's this where you calling from i
think we have 65 people on hold
at one point uh it's josh from chicago
josh from chicago what's up buddy gotta
be quick
oh um i just i i want to um
make a point and i've i've gotten in
some trouble with the libs
not not in your crowd um about the
about what's going on with the squad uh
first of all solidarity to everyone in
the squad
i just ordered my t-shirts in blue
pretty awesome
but i uh um
i am i think pelosi has helped enable
trump in when she goes and attacks the
squad
and i think in some ways actually she's
as toxic if not more than chuck schumer
who at least in the senate doesn't
openly attack members of his own caucus
and i think she does bear some
responsibility
obviously she's not she doesn't enable
trump to act like a racist well look i
mean
listen josh we said this earlier in the
show
she started out when she basically
opened the floodgates on elanomar
um three or four months ago whenever it
was
uh she had to back off it but um yeah i
agree
you cannot capitulate to them you cannot
do it you cannot
because they'll just take more
appreciate the call
i'm sorry don't mean to be uh too quick
but i gotta be too quick call from a 213
area code who's this where you calling
from
hiya can you hear me yes where are you
coming from moses
uh my my name is siddharth i'm calling
from boston
from boston i would like to quit yeah
and i'll
actually sort of talk about the
xenophobia that has been rising over the
last uh
uh week or so so it's sort of just to
give you a background so i've been
i'm an immigrant from india i've been
living in the us for the last 16 years
and i over the last 16 years i've never
felt sort of you know
any racial bigotry against me but
watching the events of what happened
this week and you know people screaming
at folks who are
actually legally immigrated in this
country become the citizen here and you
know asking them to go back
i mean that was sort of really i mean
i've never
touched before in my life and uh you
know i
i'm sort of worried where this is going
to go like even if
trump does not get elected the next time
around
you know where are you know what's going
to happen i mean these people are still
going to be here
and so i just sort of wanted to get your
thought on what do you think where do
you think this is going to go
well i mean hey i appreciate the call
i i
i feel badly i mean the because i think
your experience is
probably replicated by
millions of people in this country who
are you know who have had to deal
maybe at one time or another in their
life um
with you know feeling alienated and now
look around and feel um
scared and you know i think
on one hand i can say i feel like
things are going to i'm afraid things
are going to get worse in terms of this
like you're going to see stuff like this
on the other hand you know i'm
encouraged when you think back about the
muslim ban how quickly people mobilized
and i think
i think it's i think there are enough
people in this country
who are willing to uh step
up and you know put their um
put their bodies on the line and you
know
literally and metaphorically to um
to protect their neighbors and so um
and to defend them but i think it's i
think it's going to get uglier
i i really do and i think it's going to
be i i i think the
political party that represents
this sentiment um needs to be
defeated uh like roundly defeated
and kept defeated
i appreciate the call hang in there
call from a 914 area code who's this
where you calling from hi
this is natalia and i'm calling from new
rochelle new york
hi natalia what's on your mind um
i'm just calling because i wanted to
talk a little bit about what's going on
in puerto rico
um things are getting to like peak
fascism over there
um the demonstrations that happened um
the day before yesterday
apparently were like the largest
demonstrations that the island has seen
even larger than when they had the
demonstrations to get the
um marine out of uh submarines out of
vieques
um they're estimating it was over five
hundred thousand people
um and only 665 000 people voted for
rossignol
like the governor who's the governor
currently um
in uh 2016 when he was initially elected
which is the lowest
it was like the lowest um amount of
votes that any governor has
ever gotten um and he's refusing to
leave office um so there's going to be a
general strike
um in puerto rico on sunday um where
they're asking that people instead of
going into old san juan
because old san juan i don't know if
you've ever been there but it's you know
it's a really old like you know spanish
colonial city the streets are very
narrow it's very confined
um and there was a lot of issues in the
during the protests with the um
which were widely just very peaceful and
there was no problems
um there were people out there since
like three o'clock in the afternoon
and then my by about 11 o'clock at night
um
it seems that the police um
instigated uh yeah i saw somebody
by yeah i mean they were and it's it's
there were also reports now that there
are that there were police that were
infiltrated amongst the protesters like
dressed like protesters participating
with protesters but
in communication with the um police that
were behind the barricades to kind of be
like okay it's time to like get this
over with
and have them kind of instigate the the
initial like firecrackers
um and then an incredible display of um
abuse of force with um what are what
were supposedly rubber bullets but there
are also pictures of
like little what look like little grape
size
bbs like metal beadies not rubber
bullets at all
um there's also so anyway there's gonna
i'm sorry no go ahead because we got it
we gotta get going and we're gonna cover
more we covered a little bit yesterday
we'll cover more on monday but um
uh just uh tell us more tell us well i
just wanted to get the word out about
the general strike that's going to be
happening on the outside
the alt espresso de plaza americas which
is like a big
everybody in puerto rico would know what
that is but there's they basically want
to do it out on the express site anthony
expressway which is where they had done
the
protests for vehicus um because that way
you're out in the open you're not
enclosed and they can't
go overboard with the you know they
can't get you with the the tear gas
um as as badly but it's i mean
the guy is like he's it's he's not
leaving and he needs to go so i just
really hope that um you guys can amplify
this issue a lot and if anybody's
interested in following more about it
there's
tons of people from puerto rico that are
posting a lot on instagram
lots of videos lots of pictures um so if
you look
you know through the hashtags for ricky
renuncia
and rickygameover you'll you'll find a
lot of stuff coming directly from the
people in puerto rico
great thank you so much appreciate it
uh bear with us folks calm from a 775
yeah hello hello gotta be quick
yeah yeah this camera from el paso i was
just wondering what does the democratic
party have
the democratic party has a black agenda
because you know
i i'm a millionaire like donald trump
doesn't scare me
you know like we've been black people
been going through this
for much longer than than y'all so
what's the what's the plan to get us to
vote
well i mean i think it sort of depends
on the candidate frankly
um you know i think uh there's a lot
of candidate like kamala harris that
used to throw us in jail i'm from
originally from california i'm stationed
out here
in the army so yeah i'm saying like
yeah annoying you know what i mean like
we've lived through the the the crack
epidemic with joe biden his crime bill
that small hair is throwing us in jail
and then bernie sanders he seems cool
but when you ask him about reparation
you know he has a little little attitude
about it so
what's what are you guys trying to do to
inspire us
well what am i trying to do to inspire
you or what are the candidates trying oh
what's the democratic party
what's the democratic party trying to do
to inspire us
like what what reason should we vote
because donald trump is scary
because donald trump is saying about the
right are you gonna have me finish
are you just going to keep talking do
you i mean are you aware
of i think both uh
warren and sanders program i mean
sanders is more robust but
warren has a program too of debt
forgiveness that is i mean the
the amount of student debt that is held
by african americans in this country is
massive
uh and it's far more crippling
we want reparations bro you know that
you know that abos movie wait a second
take it easy hold on for a second hold
on all right look
are you going to let me speak is the
democratic party going to give you
reparations
uh right now no i think there's i think
there's certainly a push
within the democratic party it's far
more likely going to happen with the
democrats but i don't think it's um i
don't think it's by any
uh uh measure guaranteed whatsoever
but i'm talking about specific things
that should motivate african americans
in terms of of of material benefits
i think you're going to see things like
uh criminal justice reform is a huge uh
issue um i mean if you want operations
vote for marianne williamson
uh vote for marianne williamson i think
she's been explicit about it
i guess you're gonna have four more
years of trump
well i mean if you think that benefits
you then then you should vote for trump
oh go ahead
if you think that benefits you should
vote for trump you're not going to vote
for trump but
a voting is a transaction so you vote to
get
something out of it and if we're not
getting do you have any student loans
do you have any student loans do you
have any student loans
they say that do you have i don't know
i'll tell you i'm in the army
okay and do you intend to go out of the
army and excuse me
do you intend to go out and use the va
services
yeah okay do you think they're gonna do
better
under a privatized system than they
would uh with a with the president
sanders or
um or uh frankly any democrat president
trump
yeah well i think i'll do it just fine
if i get on their truck yeah
you do i mean you don't think they're
privatizing you don't think that wait a
second
you don't think privatizing the va is
going to hurt your uh
your health services
okay you don't need va benefits do you
intend to have children have to get out
of the army
you do yeah do you think that do you
want an epa
that is going to like it did today allow
for
toxins that are uh neurotoxins that
uh specifically hurt children
i i unders i understand that perfectly
steph
but what has i got to do for me being a
black man
do you are you going to have a black
child
because that black child is not going to
be any more of
if reparations are the only thing that's
going to do it you should vote for
marianne williamson
but if you don't care about those kids
and you think that donald trump is going
to provide a better future
for them then what you should do is go
vote for donald trump
no i don't think that donald trump you
should go vote for donald trump because
one of them here's the thing this is why
i know this call is
okay this is why this call is
this is why i think it's called
this is why i think your college
 all right
because the fact of the matter is there
is
because you turn up his phone
listen you don't think you're going to
get anything from it
no i don't i understand i understand
that somebody
listen i understand that
excuse me for a second hey dude i'm
gonna mute you
unless you let me talk on my show i'm
gonna mute you
all right you're gonna let me speak
go ahead okay
if someone doesn't pay attention to
politics
and is turned off by politics i can
understand the attitude
of a pox on both their houses
but the reason why i know this call is
is because anybody who's paying enough
attention
to call into this show and understands
that voting is transactional
understands that they're going to do
better
under a democrat than they will
a republican administration period end
of story
and if you don't think what what donald
trump is doing in terms of like
do you know what you have any idea how
many
african-americans are going to be
swindled by for-profit
universities do you know what like the
percentage of those people are
who are going to be saddled with this
debt by going to
schools that are not going to provide
them with the service that they thought
they were getting
do you know what the percentage of it
like i i i i kind of have a deal
but is it is it as many as that were
locked up under the bill clinton
administration
is that number is that never going to
matter what you should do
cory booker cory booker is leading
cory booker is leading the criminal
justice reform
uh measures all right i agree
with your critique of bill clinton i was
critiquing bill clinton
way before you were probably old enough
to even know who bill clinton was
okay roger you probably you're probably
right i'm old
so you don't need to tell me that was
bad i get it
i get it i get it i get it
but the fact of the matter is if you
understand that voting is a
transactional um
uh exercise that the idea
that even just like the odds of
even if there was no guarantees the odds
of having material benefit from the
democrats
even joe biden if only because
when bernie sanders and elizabeth warren
are in
and kamala harris are in the senate
they're going to push
joe biden on something that is going to
provide a material benefit to you
will it be exciting like what happened
if he comes out with a crime bill is it
i mean but with some women stuff in it
is it
bernie sanders not gonna vote for it
i'm just saying man i'm not i'm asking a
general question
there's a huge group of us there's a
it's a lot of
black folks young black folks that want
to know
what's in it for us yes you want us to
vote yes we
understand what's going on but is it
more better to withhold our vote
so we can get better better things so
you guys i don't know
do you think that there's been an
improvement do you think there's been an
improvement i mean this is the
this is i heard this from not just i
mean i heard this
from uh white people on the left
that withholding our vote is going to is
going to help
in regards to and i don't think that's
the case
i don't think the you mean just even
from the supreme court i mean
do you like the voting rights act
i know that's different away even under
obama it's crazy no no no no
listen the voting rights act was a
function
of republicans having the ability to put
judges on the court
now if claremont thomas does not retire
and
ginsburg and briar can hang on
there's going to be a fifth there's
going to be a fifth vote
and that fifth vote could restore listen
listen that fifth vote could restore
the voting rights act pre-clearance
provision which would enfranchise
millions of black voters
uh-huh and so and then
it was like you know like and then
what is what what is it in it for us
though what politician is talking about
this is what i have because i speak
through the judge with his better
judgment
what politics is like this is what i
have this is the democratic party's
layout for the black community
period not minorities not lgbt not
anybody else just
black okay so
the vote is worthless to you
cracking down on scams that target
african americans is worthless to you
criminal justice reform
there's something that's saying that
dude do you have any idea of how many
african americans
are going to be caught up and stuck with
debt
because of for-profit colleges go look
at the go look at a brochure
for for-profit universities
90 of the people that you will see in
that brochure are african-american
because the number one the number one
student profile for these for-profit
universities
are african-american women who get
sucked into these things because they
feel they need
a a degree to compete in the workforce
they go they work they find they run up
against the wall
they go and they uh apply to these uh
for-profit universities
they get government loans and
they graduate and their degree is
worthless and they cannot discharge
these loans
so just just loan forgiveness in and of
itself
is going to disproportionately impact
african americans
um uh just off the top of the back i
mean to the tune
of hundreds of millions of dollars of
billions of dollars
i mean so like if you don't think that's
real
if you don't think that's real if you
don't think that's real
if you don't think bernie sanders plan
to give money and
warren's plan to give money to
historically um
uh black universities is real then i
don't know what to tell you it's money
it's money going to black community
i just told you preparations well you
know what
listen i don't care what you think about
his attitude about reparations
but when you target money to
historically black universities
you can call it whatever you want
it doesn't matter we're not all about
that
i understand but i underst i understand
that
i understand and i understand that if we
if there's money that goes directly to
historic black universities
if there's criminal justice reform if
there's debt relief
for um uh uh black americans
who are sucked up in uh you know from
for-profit
universities if there's uh an extension
of minimum wage increases
if there is uh shoring up um the epa
and and regulations which uh when these
things get rolled back
you know it's the african-american
community that suffers the most
if these things aren't enough to inspire
you to vote because they're not called
reparations
then i'm telling you go vote for donald
trump
because you should at least to the
extent that you have the franchise
right because republicans are gonna keep
rolling back
the voting rights act so i gotta tell
you honestly
i think i think your complaints are
really
really thin i mean i get it we live in a
society where there's a ton of racism
and uh the united states is still and i
do think there should be reparations
but is that going to happen with this
crop of democrats who are up for
office no will not voting
further that agenda absolutely not
absolutely not it's simply not the way
that voting works
go vote for donald trump if you want
reparations
voting for donald trump trying to build
maybe over the course of decades
uh enough strength in the republican
party
where there is where african americans
can command that type of power in the
republican party that's what i would do
but not voting
that doesn't do doesn't do
doesn't do
and i'm just going to
give you the benefit of the doubt that
that was a real call
all right we'll take a couple more calls
and then we get to get out here i know
we're running late uh
michael and maya
9.4 hey i recognize your number what's
up
michael you got more patience i do
brother with that guy he was a total
plan you should have talked about for 30
seconds but whatever it is
i guess listen to the radio too much um
real quick
uh the whole between you and michael and
the gang up there if i said right now
it's harrison castro would you take that
ticket right now
right today harrison who
castro what do you mean would i take it
what does that mean
i'm saying if if it plays itself out
that the primaries come down to those
candidates and that's
that's the option i'm just curious i'm
just curious would i vote for them
i know it's not it's not my first choice
either i'm just curious that seems to be
some of the trend lines that's all i'm
saying but wait a second
if if they're the candidates would i
vote for them against donald trump
yes of course i know that yeah of course
i'm just curious
michael says absolutely no and your
thought is that what well
i don't know what you mean you mean if
that was the ticket against
donald trump well i'll say ideologically
yeah i mean i will i'm going to just say
this i think it's very likely
in this time because i'll i'll be you
know
in new york uh there's a lot of
candidates in a lot of scenarios where i
can imagine
leaving it blank or doing a protest vote
or whatever but
i will have the same position i've
always had which is that
uh if you're in a swing state you should
vote to prevent the re-election of
donald trump
okay i just i'm just i think that's
that's going to be something that a lot
of people are going to coalesce around
it's just a hunch guys i'm not saying
it's going to happen
it's not even my first choice i'm
supporting warren but i'm just telling
you i
i think you know it's something that
might be looked at to that end michael
just brought up an
interesting point this election and i
think the one since i was in florida
last time unfortunately in the polls
mean nothing
you can ignore all the national polls
except for unless you want to just
obviously get a quick snapshot the only
polls you have to pay attention to are
four or five states
or five state polls and ignore the rest
of the crap
cornacchi and those guys i i can't stand
listen to those idiots because all they
do is do
breathless race horse nonsense which is
you know as
depth as of a puddle i hate it all you
need to do is look at three or four
states
and focus on that and everything else is
blather and to be honest with you fellas
even though i agree
with a lot of your perspective i love
your deep dives
fifteen percent of the electorate is
paying attention right now nobody nobody
knows the nobody knows anything
right now except that the you know
trump's an idiot
and so i think a lot of stuff but we're
not talking to we're only talking to
that 15
i understand and i appreciate and i'm
one of them obviously so i'm just but
i just want everyone to caution
themselves that you know biden does this
and this
debate produces that result and this one
goes no it's it's worthless it means
nothing
until votes start actually being made
probably after the first of the year so
i just
well well wait a second but here's the
thing michael here's the only difference
is
that for better for worse the way our
system works is
that the narratives that end up carrying
through to the general election get
formed
in these in in this time and they're
impossible which is exactly what they're
doing with the socialist knowledge
exactly exactly america love it or leave
it crap goes back to 1968.
that that crap's been around for 50
years guys
probably longer it's the same
crap nothing's changed it's just that a
lot of people don't remember the
electoral history from way back then or
they never studied it
this is nothing new defining your
opponent ahead of time
they did it the mondale they did it
that's what that's the point
that's the point that's the point
michael is that
that these narratives i know you gotta
go
you're thinking about taking the show on
the road to michigan wisconsin at the
end of the year
or maybe early part of next year that's
a good idea i think you should
i think it'd be great hell i'd
underwrite it i tried to i think it'd be
an incredible eye-opening you're doing
very well i live in south florida you
guys live in new york
i just think the experience and the
perspective of the voters who are going
to decide this election
would be something that really would
bring some you know
value to the show and to you guys
i will say this michael i will say this
is that is that
um it is and this is indicative of
why i think you know it what i mean when
i say it's a mobilization uh
uh election the idea of doing that
for some candidates and i think it's
probably wider than most people who
listen to the show think
is easier to stomach than others for me
right like the idea like just say
hypothetically of
bringing the show on the road to
wisconsin or michigan
to promote john delaney is
almost inconceivable talk about trade to
talk about the issues you guys do deep
dives on with these great scholars every
week
go talk to those people and find out why
they went white male voters or white
female voters went for
went for trump because they believed at
least in theory
that donald trump provided some kind of
you know action that from the trades
yeah but you know the bottom line is as
much as i think that caller
uh who just called was full of it
because frankly
if you're talking about voting as a
transaction holding onto the line for
uh almost a two hours uh to talk to me
is more of an effort than he would
probably have to make to actually go
vote uh i suspect he was sort of full of
 but the bottom line is
um the it's not just a question of those
white voters who decided to vote for
donald trump
is a question of of bringing out voters
who sat
out that last election i appreciate it
two days ago brother was right on the
money this is about go
to the place in the pond where the fish
are don't worry about this other crap
just go get that's how they that's how
we won an 18.
they went and got people who normally
don't vote they were so mobilized
that they got them to the polls because
of a lengthening process in this case it
was trump i will say
this though michael i gotta go i know i
don't really
if they don't do something in terms of
of holding trouble
uh trump accountable i think a lot of
people are motivated to come out and 18
may not show up in twenty
there's no more character issue that's
great but
we'll see appreciate the cause all right
folks i'm sorry we don't have time for
more calls we have like something like
45
callers on the phone i mean at least 20
of you have been on the phone for
over an hour i just cannot get to you um
i'm sorry uh on the ims screwdricks and
from portland we did get the beer i
didn't realize it was from you i thought
it was from the folks in the building
for the last debate i drank quite a bit
of that resin
thank you all right folks uh i'm sorry
we couldn't get to more calls we'll try
and take some we'll try and do
uh uh another one uh
