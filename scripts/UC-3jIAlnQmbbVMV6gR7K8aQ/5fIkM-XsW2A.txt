we were playing with this last night on
the tmbs post game because
uh jordan peterson actually said
recently that this was a
this was really amazing you know piece
of work
um actually we should maybe play that
yeah let's just play that why not
let's just give them the full the full
entree here
a little bit of double dips today but
this stuff is too good
uh to not do um
so let's play
jordan peterson talking to a very dumb
stephen crowder yeah jordan peterson can
set up this uh video clip for us
actually jordan peters
exactly gig hey dr peterson the original
reason we were going to have you on we
didn't know we were going to have
lindsey on
was you had seen also the alexa video
and had some strong opinions
and reached out and that sort of caught
fire with this controversy first off it
was meant to be sort of artificial
intelligence a discussion on that
when we brought the video out right
naked jared and then it became about a
conspiracy about
faking an alexa video which people ran
with which was their
time to do yeah which we had to do was
verify
what was that or maybe even the talent
yes yes
um so i i know you reached out you you
this is something you've kind of uh
talked about for a while
what's what's your take on this beware
of what
kind of unconscious you build into your
artificial intelligence
yeah so it's an important point and
right it's really and we're really going
to be conti i really thought that your
video was a kind of watershed moment in
some sense you know because
it's the first example i've seen of a
like a human robot interaction of that
sort
that produced that kind of politically
charged statement
okay so this is pretty heady stuff
from a person that has been identified
as the most important
public intellectual in the western world
let's go back into the time tunnel
or the let's go back in time we went
back to this
watershed moment let's go back to this
watershed moment
and not only broadcast history but
actually the relationship
between the human subconscious
and technology alexa what is
communism communism
an economic or political system based on
the sharing of all working property by
the whole community
alexa what is socialism
socialism the marxist leninist economic
system
i that's not right at all no there's
socialism wrong
there's socialism that predated marx and
their socialisms that emerged
uh independent of it right yeah don't
you know anything alexa
yeah that is alexa what is marxism
marxism is a socio-economic method that
analyzes class relations and society of
conflict using a materialist
interpretation of historical development
and a dialectical view of social
transformation
it uh i was gonna say that alexa nailed
that one
that is a textbook she just spat
knowledge
i might crib that one yeah it probably
helps that she has
instant access to google yeah exactly
that's that's well that's there's going
to be a little bit of a theme
to our own what google may or may not be
doing here and how these guys may or may
not
understand the most basics not only
really of technology but literally the
algorithms upon which
their whole silly business even rests on
social transformation so it basically
just said
communism is socialism socialism is the
incorporation of marxism
and then marxism was so it effectively
concedes
concedes that they are all the same
thing well no
point proved apparently wow that's good
enough that's okay
sure alexa what is fascism
fascism is a form of radical
authoritarian nationalism
characterized by dictatorial power
forcible suppression of opposition and
control of industry and commerce that
came to prominence in early 20th century
europe
it seems that there's a much more
negative view of fascism
than communism it would seem that she
has some stronger opinions there
seems that she was about i only say what
i know communism
is beautiful in theory it just hasn't
been implemented correctly yet
she's a little commie alexa who was
joseph stalin
joseph viserianovich stalin was a
georgian-born soviet revolutionary and
political leader
pause it i will say that is a
pretty chill read on stalin
i'm gonna have to give him at least the
tip of the hat there
well she's not wrong she's not wrong but
that might not be what you lead with
she kind of skipped over the part where
you hurt a lot of people alexa
i mean on the flip she also skipped over
the part where he was instrumental in
defeating nazism and winning world war
ii like she basically i'm down for
including both of them yeah i'm down for
like let's include that he was a
absolutely vicious mass murderer
probably even potentially even in his
own personal life
and that without his
soviet army and his cunning after
previously forming a fascist alliance
with hitler
we would not have defeated nazism and an
endless amount of
uh russians uh died in that effort
and they never get any credit it's
totally unfair
alexa how many people did joseph stalin
kill
joseph stalin is the killer of 41
million 500
000 people seems like you would leave
with that it seems like that should be
included
alexa who were the nazis
historically nazis were those who
followed the far-right ideology of adolf
hitler with political beliefs involving
the superiority of the aryan race
eyebrows go up when they say far right
uh
right what what do these morons
want see this is where
these guys are so stupid because
what they
want apparently
is there can be no complexity or reality
in a discussion of socialism
or marxism that just has to be all it is
is stalin killed a lot of people there's
no intellectual tradition there's no
fabian socialism no christian socialism
and to be fair i'm sure that stephen
crowder has no idea what any of those
things i just mentioned are he's a dumb
guy
but so but i at least i understand what
they're whining and beefing about with
the socialism and marxism thing because
why are you describing other things it
should just be the body counts
okay that's what they're saying it
should just be the black book of
communism
which had some methodological problems
by the way is a book but what do they
want
the complication around fascism to be do
they want it to be that like
nazism was a cool idea
about germans feeling better about
themselves and hiking in the alps but
unfortunately some bad things happen
they built some good interstates and
pioneered some missile technology
so is he doing that or is he doing the
ultimate
 dinesh d'souza don jr
jonah goldberg chestnut which is that
the nazis were also leftists
is that where we're going okay
historically
nazis were those who followed the
far-right ideology of adolf hitler
with political beliefs involving the
superiority of the aryan race
the right of german territorial
expansion and the exclusion and eventual
extermination of unfit peoples from the
population
in modern times neo-nazi ideology still
advocates hyper-nationalism and racial
purity
alexa what does nazi stand for
c is an abbreviation of cytosine alexa
what does nazi stand for
what does nazi mean
the word nazi has a few different
meanings as an adjective
one relating to or consistent with or
typical of the ideology and practice of
nazism or the nazis
alexa who was the nationalist socialist
workers party
here's something i found on wikipedia
the national socialist german workers
party
commonly referred to in english as the
nazi party there we go
thank you alexa no more
thanks for the feedback
alexa she owned him okay now this is
just the last one that i think i think
this is maybe the most revealing one
question they ask and the way their
reactions are to it here we go okay
so what is black lives matter
oh god black lives matter is an
international activist movement
originating in the african-american
community that campaigns against
violence and systemic racism towards
black people
alexa is kind of she's pretty
historically informed and
kind of woke all right let's keep
lives matter is an international
activist movement originating in the
african-american community
that campaigns against violence and
systemic racism towards black people
alexa how many black lives matter
activists have stolen you
god
that's so racist not to state the
obvious
but like god i feel like that is
actually the laugh for that
it's amazing to me that they are so
assured that everyone's gonna have that
reaction to that answer about black
lives matter right like can you believe
they say they're against police violence
what you mean a standard definition
about people working so that their
children brothers and sisters
and fathers and husbands aren't murdered
in the streets as we see
almost literally every day it's
ridiculous
i've got a clip here what about george
soros funded
ultra nationalist auntie white plot to
kill white people like they're doing in
south africa
alexa well this is why comedy is so
contingent
upon the society in which it's produced
the people the place like because i
don't know 50 years ago
the majority of people would have
thought that his joke was funny
and now the majority of people
understand that that joke is racist
and only racists think that that joke is
funny that meaning is socially
constructed i have
a clip here from volcker eric's hitler
ascent 1889-1939 this talks about his
relationship to marxism
tell me more wow i think you just
literally
both the social democrats and the
communists but because the moderate
hamburg
spd which cooperated with bourgeois
liberals was not a suitable target for
attack
hitler concentrated his bile on the kpd
whose leader
ernst talman came from the northern
german port city
hitler deliberately called upon the
fears of his audience which included
leading hamburg merchants
of the communists coming to power if
communism were to triumph today
two million people would be making their
way to the gallows he prophesied
but there was a way of smashing and
eradicating the marxist worldview
which was the aim of his own movement
the nsdap
hitler proclaimed knew that toxins could
only be combated with antitoxins
and the party would not rest until the
last marxist has either been converted
or eliminated
the initially reserved audience greeted
these words with frenetic applause
and at the end of the speech when hitler
proclaimed his vision of a germany of
freedom and power
he was showered with ovations and shouts
of heil
there's your leftist nazis stephen
crowder you idiot
alexa who was that
alexa who was being quoted
yeah matt but do you remember uh what
nazis stand for
oh i forgot about that i don't know
i don't know i mean i got socialists
name but guess that does mean anything i
don't know if volcker
erlich or ulrich addressed that but that
is a pretty
vulkar ehrlich was he in metallica
it's textbook fascist to take words
that people like and appropriate them
and a concept that people like like
that's what they're doing now with
liberal
j.r bolsonaro's party that he is running
on
is called the social liberal party and
he's literally a fascist
who's called for you know who's said
that the military dictatorship didn't
torture and murder enough people when it
ran brazil
now again i have no doubt that stephen
crowder does not know who jairo
bolsonaro is a dumb person yeah stephen
crowder is a very stupid guy so i'm
trying to be fair here so
maybe unless you know the koch brothers
or whoever else
sent him uh uh an email and said you
need to know
who j.r bolsonaro is you dumb little
prick because that's who we're going to
install in brazil to torture the
indigenous people
he has no idea who he is otherwise
because he's a stupid uninformed person
he might not i'm not even clear that
stephen crowder knows what brazil
is certainly not that it's portuguese
speaking
