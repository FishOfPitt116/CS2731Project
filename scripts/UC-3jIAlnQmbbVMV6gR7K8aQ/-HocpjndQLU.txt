[Music]
let's just preview the debate a little
bit tonight
um start off with this uh
this guy on cnn um
this is i think uh i mean i think this
is sort of
accurate in some way um
sort of but there's there's one premise
let's see if you can figure this out
what this premise is
that is that is mistaken here right when
he talks about
twitter twitter democrats
democratic party right now a real
concern
among some more centrist democrats
establishment democrats that the party
is moving too far left that they're
chasing
uh twitter headlines instead of
where the majority of the american
people may be that concern exists
in certain circles and i think tonight
there is going to be
this i would imagine assertion from
folks who are not in the center of the
stage who are more moderate
to try and make that case and appeal to
that
sensibility that concern in some
quarters of the party that
the policies that warren and sanders
particularly are driving forth
may be uh uh too far left i will just
say
warren sanders have been fighting
against that theory their entire
political lives
all right well here's the problem with
the with the just the
the whole theory that this guy
postulates
if it was the case that it's just
twitter democrats as he says
that are driving this sort of push to
the left why is it
that no one else on that stage will be
polling in double digits
other than warren and bernie sanders
like i mean and it's not even
close you got buddha judge i think is
around seven maybe
maybe eight maybe eight probably closer
to seven on
average i'm talking about the yeah you
gotta average these polls that's seven
or eight yep
and then everyone else no one i think
breaks
three percent and that may be generous
so you have to ask yourself if it's just
about chasing twitter
how is it that twitter and and it's true
there's not a lot of people on political
twitter as it were
certainly not 33 how is it possible
that they are commanding between the two
of them
a plurality it appears at this point
close to it
of the democratic vote how could that
possibly be the case
on top of which i still contend that
i don't know
that other than the labeling that is
done by people like that
and by the centrists the people really
care about the labels
it really is just sort of like how you
wear it i think
they care about your instincts they care
about
i do think some policies have salience
for people but i agree with you and i
and i think yeah not only people not
care about labels broadly i think you
still see
depending on your like in certain social
environments i see people wanting to
claim the tag socialist when they are
definitely not because they perceive it
as cool and trendy
and then in other social environments i
see people that are extremely left who
still like to say
you know i'm a moderate also who
are these establishment voters that he
keeps referencing
like i like it when they make people up
uh and then
you're like oh it's you yeah of course i
mean i don't think it's him
necessarily uh but certainly the people
who are espousing this they're talking
about themselves a lot of people are
saying
a lot of people are saying there's not a
poll there's not i want to see some
numbers on that
well that's what they always mean is
they're small social groups because as
i've said
a gazillion times like socially
moderate and maybe even in some areas to
the right and absolutely economically
populist and left would be where you
would find so-called swing voters
and they're always invariably talking
about people that are i wouldn't even
say socially left i would say it's
quasi-socially tolerant
and right-wing corporate economics all
right kamala harris is not going to be
on uh tonight so let's tomorrow let's
say that uh for tomorrow night
um what's this who's this guy this is a
robert wolf former
economic advisor to president obama all
right let's just do uh this one and then
um uh one more point about uh
warren's got a proposal today that i
imagine will come up in the debate but
uh this is the rhodes 2020 on fox news
this guy wolf is uh gonna blow is this
ainsley erhardt again
blow her mind with his description of
the democrats
so who's going to be fighting in the
debate tonight who are they going to go
after probably warren because she's
ahead
yeah i think right now on stage you have
a bunch of moderates tonight you have
like beto
and mayor pete and tim ryan and
klobuchar and it's easy to go out
moderates versus versus versus where
bernie and warren are
i mean we're all with i'm talking within
the party
well he's not from medicare for all so
so there's a few things he hasn't been
for
same with beto so you have real debates
whether it's on open borders or medicare
for all or student loans
that you guys were chatting about and to
me you have to kind of punch up
but more importantly you got to let
people know what you stand for and
that's what
the the party's not doing enough now
the idea that the parties not do it
first of all
open borders he's making that up yeah
maybe at the dsa convention
but the idea of the parties not making
it known what it stands for
there's literally a debate with 20
candidates
each one of them racing out with their
policy proposals
earlier and in more depth than i think
i've ever seen
compare this to what the republican
party's
last primary was like i'm gonna build a
wall
and then uh jeb bush would say well i'm
gonna build a bigger wall
and then uh marco rubio would say well
i'm gonna build a thicker wall
that was basically the policy debate
during the uh during the
i mean so this is just absurd um we're
getting a good
uh debate on policy
we're not seeing a ton of details on all
these things so it's a little bit
difficult to sort of follow them
uh on some respects i can tell you that
kamala harris's
medicare for all proposal is uh taking
a bit of a hit particularly on the
10-year waiting period because people
realize like wait they did the math and
they found out that
if barack obama had tried to push the
aca
with a 10-year window then donald trump
would have been the one who would have
been
responsible for implementing it so that
seems like a
non-starter exactly from uh the get-go
um the other interesting thing is
there was pushback from bernie sanders
medicare for all
uh folks saying that her plan is not
really a medicare for all now the irony
sent an email
what's that they sent an email yeah the
irony
is that as i've been saying in the past
that
bernie's medicare for all bill is really
like a medicaid for all
because it's more generous it's more
inclusive it would be medicare insofar
as maybe the reimbursement rates would
be closer in line with medicare
uh more people would take it more people
are aware of it but they specifically
wanted to brand it medicare because
that doesn't have the stigma apparently
that medicaid does
so there's some brouhaha there where the
the
harris people are saying well yours is
really a medicaid for all but this and
that
it's at the end of the day um
her proposal was i think put out in many
respects
to seem like a moderate version of
bernie's plan
when in fact it was just one that does
not appear to
to make sense because of it the 10-year
thing doesn't make sense
and the medicare advantage element of it
doesn't make sense because people go to
medicare advantage because it's more
generous
not so much if if you get really sick
but it's more generous if you don't get
really sick
but but bernie's version of the medicare
for all plan would
would provide those things so it doesn't
quite make any sense but i just
can't just say really briefly too that i
mean and that phase in is a matter of
lives too
i mean you you elongate that you're
putting more people's lives at risk the
same way that
you know joe biden's just unbelievable
lies and fear-mongering
you know even under obamacare which i'm
the first to admit that's not what i
want but of course has improved health
care
there's still tens of millions of people
without health insurance and there's
still plenty of people who have health
insurance but don't properly use it
because they can't afford
deductibles and so on can i just say i'm
really glad that bernie is pushing back
on this and showing
where they differ on this policy because
that's the kind of thing that we were
hoping he would do
going into the first debate and maybe
didn't do so well well she didn't have a
proposal at that time
yeah um also
