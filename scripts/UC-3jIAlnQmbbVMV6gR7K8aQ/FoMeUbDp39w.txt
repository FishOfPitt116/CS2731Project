here is uh oh as you know
um why should we play this one first
uh lon omar uh has
issued an apology is my understanding
for uh being although it was a very good
uh
i thought her apology was pretty good
actually because
it didn't deny it it apologized for the
use of language it didn't deny the
dynamic that i think uh we all um
uh that everyone
knows which is that there is
a uh an israeli a pro
really right-wing israeli lobby
that is largely
a um not just uh
you know it's not exclusively a function
of money but but is
highly fueled by money and that is
essentially what alan
omar said i mean
if there was something uh that she said
that was different from that i'd be open
to it
but let me let me not make this argument
let me for the first time in my
15-year career
of professionally talking about
politics defer and
outsource if you will this argument
to thomas friedman united case
in the supreme court that um basically
said
unlimited campaign donations now what
that meant
is it gave enormous power i've written
all this you know in my column
to the israel lobby why because maddie
if you and i are running
for congress from the same district and
i have
apex stamp of approval and you don't i
will
maybe have to make three phone calls and
i can raise my whole
i'm exaggerating but i don't have to
make many phone calls to get all the
money i need
to run against you you will have to make
50 000 phone calls
so that pulled the whole spectrum to the
right then the israeli government
we had a much more conservative
government come in so what i've seen in
america
is the whole spectrum on the israel
question
has moved to the right to the point and
this is very disappointing to me
where if you're a young political
officer you're in nea our nearest
division the state department
you dream one day of being ambassador to
oman
oh i want to be ambassador to oman the
car you know the whole thing i do
you will not state publicly what is
actually official u.s policy
that israeli settlements are an obstacle
to peace all right
so there you have it folks um now
thomas friedman uh laid it out in a
slightly a different way
in this uh interview with maddie hassan
but uh that's because he wasn't on
twitter
and uh alan omar said basically the same
thing
that our policy
towards israel in this country is
a function of money that comes from
aipac
how is that different from what thomas
friedman just said well here's the
difference in fact
she's a muslim well that's true
also i haven't heard her explicitly
defend killing unarmed protesters in
gaza so if you want to talk about aipac
funding
you're going to need to buy a little
currency by defending israel killing
civilians
she didn't even go as far as as friedman
did and say that this
also intimidates bureaucrats in the u.s
government
right she just was talking about uh the
first part of what he said
that if i'm running against you i could
make three phone calls
maybe five that's right and get funded
and so
uh but the idea of there's the the
outrage uh but
good for her this is her um this was her
apology
anti-semitism is real and i'm grateful
for jewish allies and colleagues who are
educating me on the painful history of
anti-semitic tropes
my intention is to is never to offend my
constituents or jewish americans as a
whole
we all we have uh to always be willing
to step back
and think through criticism just as i
expect people to hear me
when others attack me for my identity
this is why i
unequivocally apologize that is
a a a very mature
apology she goes on to say at the same
time
i reaffirm the problematic role of
lobbyists in our politics
whether it be aipac the nra or the
fossil fuel industry it's gone on too
long and we must be willing to address
it
and also just to and to be clear i mean
that's
i that's such a perfect response but i
also think like
one of the reasons that i have you know
a long
and i don't know what we're calling it
because we have like daily conversations
and we almost need like a style guide
about
what we call identity politics but
so but let me just say it for purposes
of simplicity but one of the reasons
that i've always had
a real problem and a critique of certain
weaponizations
of identity over policy is
going back a very long time even just
even back to like dinner table
conversations on israel and the idea
that you know identity or even
serious historical wrongs and
contemporary bigotry can overcome the
reality of what that state is is
fundamentally wrong
and you know and i and i'm glad i think
she's responding to
you know the correct impulse that a
handful of people had that
called out some of what was questionable
framing that tweet
but obviously a vast majority of what's
going on here is profoundly cynical
trump's just called on her to resign
from congress and it's time for people
to
really close ranks and stop the bs
and get to the substance and i mean
there's i don't know if we're going to
play it but it's like
on the other end of the spectrum i'm see
you know some people saying like oh you
know amy klobuchar essentially can do
this because she's like a woman she can
abuse her staff
and i and i it's just bizarre it's
really unhealthy it's
it's ridiculous and people need to and
she's handled it with a lot of class and
a lot of grace and there's nothing wrong
with like i think actually
there's really great conversations that
people can have and just sort of like
upping their game and we should all do
that but the substance shouldn't be lost
and the fact that this is being
unbelievably i mean
if you have steve scalise saying good
thing she apologized
yeah is grotesque about this this notion
of
of donald trump saying that her apology
isn't good enough calling for a
resignation steve
steve scalise the guy who literally sold
himself
as david duke without the baggage in his
early campaigns
uh to be in any way he's criticizing
this
here's kevin mccarthy here's a tweet
that kevin mccarthy put out
uh just days after what was it the
pittsburgh uh
right tree of life three of life murders
we cannot allow soros steyer and
bloomberg
to buy this election get out and vote
republican november
6th there you go of course hashtag and
of course what's amazing to me is like
that actually is it illan omar
it is ill-considered to tweet it's
to do a it's all about the benjamin but
this is objective
yeah she was talking about what was
influencing policy towards
israel here's this
i think uh maybe someone should educate
um
anyone from nancy pelosi to donald trump
about this but
uh israel and being jewish is not
synonymous
and we can make that argument um
both on the left end of the spectrum
with people like myself who do
not have paius but i can also bring in
some people who do have pais
and make the same argument
