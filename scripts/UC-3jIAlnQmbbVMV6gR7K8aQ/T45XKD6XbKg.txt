this is a distillation of everything
that just happened this is a group of
women protestors rightfully continuing
heroes and the heroes rightfully
continuing to press after this grotesque

doesn't have a judicial temperament and
the fact that there is exceedingly
credible allegations against them in the
fact that he lied and lied and lied and
the fact that he's a corporate bagman
and the fact that there's actually
complaints about his conduct in his
court that had been forwarded to the
Roberts Court and the fact that of

of the great heroes of our time
