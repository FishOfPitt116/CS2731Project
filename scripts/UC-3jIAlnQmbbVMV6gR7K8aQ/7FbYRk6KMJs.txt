apparently joe rogan
is uh had an interviewed barry weiss oh
yuck and uh boy oh boy
um you know like uh
again
joe rogan's podcast very very popular
incidentally um
hugely popular and positive it seems
like she actually convinced him i think
to have uh aoc on
oh is that right so he's like oh i'm
working on it oh that is
i believe that that'll be that'll be
good that'll be very good
um but you know and and i'll be honest i
haven't watched the whole thing
i don't know that i could uh watch the
whole thing with barry weiss um
but here's an instance where a new york
times columnist
uh just simply uh validates something
uh based upon what joe rogan says and
joe rogan validates it because somebody
sent it to him on the internet
um again you know
you have hundreds of thousands of people
watching you
really if you have i mean from my
perspective like you know
2 000 people thousand people 500 people
you have a responsibility
just if you're gonna impart information
to do
some measure of due diligence and i tell
this
to all of my elderly relatives
who hear something and they get
it in an email and they email me like is
this true
and i got this from my in-laws and and
everybody and i just said
we google this for you.com exactly what
you do
is you just take if you get an email
from somebody and it seems a little bit
wacko like
do you remember when um uh when bro
you know john kennedy said the following
that like taxes were bad and this and
that
and as social justice warriors are going
to ruin the country
you take a phrase and you google it
because
more often than not it's going to lead
you uh to the truth
here is joe rogan not having done that
behind this there's
when you have a spectrum right the far
right and the far
left they have a very similar reaction
as they drive
a person to the other side the person
that sees the far
right and sees repulsive racism
and and bigotry that did you know build
that wall these mexicans those
little kids they should have known
better they're all illegals
that kind of person that pushes people
towards progressivism
it pushes people towards much more
liberal even socialist ideologies like
 that grossness
i said now i i you know what's
fascinating about this and this little
bit off the topic of this clip is just
that i don't
i don't think that's the case frankly on
the left i don't think
a um a socialist
or a progressive perspective
comes from seeing bigotry
because i think you know largely it's a
it's a
i don't think people are reacting to
bigotry and they become
more left i mean i think i think he's
talking i think a little i think that's
true on the
right i think on the right when people
get uncomfortable
with with sort of like broader inclusion
and it threatens
their social status
i think they move to the right i think
you're right about that i'm not going to
debate that but where i think you're
not entirely right is i think that he's
speaking in a way
in fact look he's literally
self-diagnosing himself right
when he plays a clip if you stank him as
like the average centrist whatever way
you want to find him
if you throw him clips of what's
happening with ice
or somebody saying something obscene
about detained people
he goes to the right place and he's like
that's disgusting
we played that clip of him saying you're
not on tv right right
i think there's a lot of normal people
who
actually whatever you want to call it
progressive liberal socialist whatever
i think they actually do uh react very
strongly against that
but that's different no that's what he's
saying no no no that's what he's saying
no he's saying it pushes you to the left
and i don't think that what he was doing
there was being pushed to the left i
think he was just simply saying
oh wait trump and you people you're not
on the t
you're not on youtube by the modern
definition that would put him
in the left i mean you could get
pedantically no no but i'm saying
i don't think you adopt an ideology on
the left
a a you know a a progressive ideology
you may become uh you know more uh
attuned
to uh you know racism and whatnot but
that doesn't necessarily mean you move
to the left
right i mean you know i think in the
parlance he's using it
yes it does mean you move to some sort
of left and i i do think that there are
people all right well whatever
yeah i mean whatever it's getting
pedantic but i think that there's
something to what he's saying that's
actually relevant for us to learn from
frankly
maybe people towards progressivism it
pushes people towards
much more liberal even socialist
ideologies like that grossness
and the same thing could be said for
someone like i'm gonna send you
something jamie
this is a real uh poster that antifa
is sending um they were putting on um
on wall on walls and and fence posts and
in uh the pacific northwest and uh it's
actually kind of hilarious
because it's so stupid do i see it i'm
gonna i'm gonna send it to jamie and
jamie's gonna put it up on the screen
here
but uh it it says uh
oops wrong wrong jamie sorry jamie
kilstein
here you go buddy i just sent it it says
when you date a white
it's not all right and it's like it's
telling people to not
date white people propagation of whites
is propagation of hatred oppression
homophobia sexism transphobia
racism and ableism now if i was so are
we supposed to
sterilize white people there it is we
can see it up on the big screen so it's
even greater cool that's because it's
large
but this is the thing racism
is racism is terrible right so how do
you stop racism well racism is can only
be
perpetrated by white people oh well the
problem is white people we got to stop
white people well now you're racist
like you're literally being racist to
stop is this really everywhere i've
never seen oh well the people are
finding it and
posting it online
it's probably just one right but
the per but the person exists
right right except for the person uh
doesn't exist
um because it turns out i mean it could
be one person
it's probably it's probably someone who
uh wrote that you know when we say left
is best i don't know if people remember
where that came from
but it was a graffiti that was written i
think in somewhere in connecticut
connecticut
at one point that my hometown right was
in your hometown yeah and it turned out
by some right-wingers who wanted to make
it look like
that was sort of a a little bit
ham-fisted i used to play on that
playground
oh wow i didn't know he wanted to make
it look like the like these leftists
were ruining the playground
did antifa and that's how he uh he
introduced it right
uh put up this poster in seattle this is
yeah sorry we might have gone a little
overboard on that one this is snopes
and this is a two-year-old incidentally
it was two years ago this hoax was up
there on december 5th 2016 a photograph
purportedly showing a poster warning
against the propagation of whites
was published to the website uh in
merger
uh this is uh this is uh like weeks
after the election right when
in fact the left leftist best thing
happened i think if i'm not mistaken it
was around that exact same time
and um the uh
the local antifa to the extent that
there
was you know an organized antifa group
and yeah i
imagine there would have been um they
said uh
okay it's signed by emerald city antifa
there
and uh if you go down keep going
actually you decided they posted to uh
on december 6 2016.
emerald city antifa posted a facebook
message saying they had nothing to do
with either the creation or the
distribution of the poster it also
responded to several comments explaining
that the message expressed in the poster
was not in line with their views
um so clearly somebody was pretending to
be them
so this is this is all i would say it's
like you look i and i didn't watch the
whole battery wise thing but if you have
if you're gonna do this just do like
take some just feel the responsibility
of what you're doing
especially it's like dude you could
totally find i'm sure
some really stupid examples of the kind
of things you're looking for
that are real from twitter or wherever
else and if you really wanna
i mean i feel time choices are politics
in and of themselves but is that really
what you think is so important to spend
time on
find a real one for god's sake right
exactly
i mean i i'm sure that somewhere in
america silent night is is sung without
mentioning jesus and that's why there's
a war on christmas
uh but but but honestly there's for real
i mean most of the
people should go on barry i think he is
the new york times columnist for christ
right and i would say this and i don't
know where he was going with this
but um to equate
the implications of something like that
poster
with the institutional and systemic
racism we have in this country
they're not the same things
the power makes a difference
the and the um
the power dynamic means everything and
you to put it in terms of fighting
right you could say well they're both
fighters
one of them weighs 90 pounds and the
other weighs 230 pounds
but they're both fighting they're both
fighters when
the black israelites who one of the
greatest things that happened out of
this
whole story in dc is more people finding
out who they are which i really
appreciate in terms of my comedic base
but uh like but if you live in
new york or something they're nothing
new to you and and they actually you
know what uh
look they they uh they're hateful and
they yell uh
uh bad they trigger white people
and um if i walk by them and they call
me like a devil
and they're particularly upset but you
know i find it has
zero implications for my life it makes
no difference it has no interaction i'm
going to have with a bank or a cop
or anything and so you could just
generically say like you know what yeah
i think nobody should be involved
in um you know cults that are hateful i
i sure as a generic proposition i agree
with that
but that has there's zero stakes it
doesn't mean a
 thing well for me the stakes are
i get exposed to new ideas
