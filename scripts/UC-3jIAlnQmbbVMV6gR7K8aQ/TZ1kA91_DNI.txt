calling from a 720 area code who are you
where you calling from
uh this is james from denver james
what's going on
nothing much man um i'm just calling
uh because why is everybody shooting on
angela nagle now
oh man you really want to talk i don't
think we have time to call for 210.
when i tucker carlson talking about
immigration in a way that was
friendly uh i mean look i'm not gonna
she she published a very very bad
article
called the uh socialist case against
open borders
in which she either ignorantly
or you know just on purpose
disingenuously um
conveyed some extremely a historical
and just false arguments and
about immigration all right i i think he
used data
from uh right-wing think tanks and kind
of told on herself
i think that okay all right
and i did a whole episode uh just
showing like with an actual labor
historian
uh breaking down the lies and the bad
arguments that she was using
and that people like tucker carlson use
as well all right i think
that and i'm not gonna i'm just not
gonna dwell too much on this but i think
that okay there's a there's a context
behind
this angela nagel thing i know that this
upsets a lot of people but it is what it
is
she wrote a book that is a good book
it is a very worthwhile book to read
to understand some of the in time
dynamics of the last couple of years
when i had her on my show
i challenged her on some of the broader
historical context of that book
i don't agree with all of our assertions
but i agree with a lot of them
and i think it's been really
unfortunate because i think that there
has been a sort of
symbiotic cycle in the last couple of
years
of look
there's plenty of things to criticize
her on but some of the criticisms of her
are ridiculous like people are calling
her a nazi
okay people were calling and that's what
we're saying she did a podcast with
sargon of akkad
which isn't true he uploaded it she
debated him
uh at university in ireland and she made
him look stupid as
right so there's a lot of i think i mean
that is a bad move to go on tucker
carlson
well let me let me just say how people
just get rid of people
i i don't i 100 agree with you i i think
there the vampire castle is very alive
and well and it's a big problem
and i don't support it but i will say
this
that piece again okay some people said
she's shown herself to be a nazi or
whatever that's ridiculous okay i don't
like what she did show herself to be in
that piece
is kind of economically illiterate
and making a basically a third way
clinton-style argument it wasn't a nazi
argument it was a clintonian argument
which was uh
not only was it profoundly the wrong
time to write that piece in terms of
like
the actual reality of what's happening
at the border
it also uh it
ironically like because
so much of the drama around nagel has
nothing to do with
like the real stuff in the world it's
all of these interesting debates some of
which are important some of which would
be better if people just logged off
but it read to me like she's
fed up for some very justifiable reasons
and also she doesn't absorb valid
criticisms
it's a dialectic in my view but she's
fed up and then she goes and she's gonna
write like a kind of
 you piece to the left
and then the f and then the proxy for
that is immigration
which like in the real world what's
happening right now
is that there's no open borders argument
that's on the table that's an irrelevant
that's that's a red herring on in two
ways
one is that the left socialist utopian
no borders thing has nothing to do with
anything
that we're dealing with today whether
you agree with it or not it's irrelevant
sorry hard fact that is the mainstream
position on the socialist left though
her position is not a mainstream one on
the socialist left
whatever i mean i'm talking like on an
actual even
even socialists that are more policy
oriented
are gonna or know that there is a
process by which it gets there
right like that's not nobody is in a
discussion today saying like oh yeah
tomorrow we're gonna just shut down
all borders that's not what's happening
it's a horizon sure and it's a horizon
that i agree with and i'm happy to say
that but it has nothing to do with what
we're talking about right
what people are talking about is a
horrifically violent apparatus that is
abusing people
in some of the most obscene and
barbarous ways imaginable
and then and other things just to add to
it too
you know the libertarian version of
quote unquote open borders ain't
open it's highly controlled highly
bureaucratized
very violent but it just moves cheap
labor so
you know look go to dubai super easy to
move around there labor-wise
there's zero rights for people right you
know what i'm saying
so that's another thing it's the
rhetorically it's totally different and
the actual meat of it
is having a critique of ice and things
like that
then the third point is and where on
just in a hard-headed way and bashkar
simkara went off on this
it just isn't it's not an economically
viable argument because we've already
globalized to such an extent
that you're not going to just
be able to like like the engine of what
drives wages down
is the corporate sector it's not
immigrants
and the criminalization of migration as
well drives wages down for everybody i
agree with that but i'm saying it's just
a
baseline like where we put our focus of
analysis
is the corporate sector not migrants
so it depends where do you want to start
your argument if you start your argument
if like the world is as it is and it's a
given maybe you could make some
little tweak cases that a few more
low-income jobs would open up without
immigrants but if you want
to make the bigger case for restoring a
social democracy
and enhancing standards internationally
then there has to be a globally
synchronized
movement and the last thing i will ding
her on which and
and this is harder for me because again
she wrote a good book
she's not a secret fascist or nazi and
some of the criticisms of her have been
insane and ridiculous
i agree i don't believe in getting rid
of people like that i'm with you
but this piece sucked
and the need to and this is even before
we get to the tucker carlson
appearance and then the last thing i'll
say which really started this is when i
started to get irritated when i read the
piece
she's making all these arguments and
it's like well why don't we go to the
afl-cio website and see what their
position on these issues is
and their position is as a mainstream
you know non-radical not like we're
gonna all have daffodils and
dance together in the park and play
drums in a socialist utopia
but as a on the ground powerful
but under assault union in
2018 america is a hundred percent
pro-solidarity in immigration reform
and that has infinitely more credibility
than any of the like right-leaning
scholars she's working from
as well as the fact that she yes she
didn't paint
a fully historicized view of some of
those previous
anti-immigration moves which absolutely
were racialized so look
i'm down i'm never going to do this like
who she's done she's canceled i don't
like that culture i don't support it i
would
have conversations with angela nagle i
think it's a great debate to have
and i also think there's another
counter-tendency of other people who
have rightly reacted against that
culture the vampire culture the mark
fisher sa
where now it's like all of a sudden like
we've got to defend her
doing an uncritical appearance on tucker
carlson we have to pretend that this
article is really important and really
formidable
it's not it sucks it doesn't mean she's
canceled doesn't mean that i don't like
her book and it doesn't mean i think she
i'm just saying what i think and that's
not how i go about things
and that and that leaves me in a
position ironically where of course
everybody's triggered by that but that
just is what it is so i
acknowledge sorry james go ahead and
then
flirt with jamie but what just i i know
you didn't want to go into that and i
really appreciate
breaking it down because it's just so
hard to even
find anyone really discussing this well
you know because like i agree i couldn't
tell what to trust
on a tape because it's like it would
either be these tankies like oh she's
canceled blah blah blah
or people where it's like oh i can't
even tell if maybe you are just all
right
right now and 100 i really appreciate it
and i think it's
it's good to get back to dialogues with
these things in the last
you know just uh i
i don't know it was a bad move at peace
but
uh oh people make mistakes
whatever i appreciate it and i think
there's also market conversations
because it's also like
frankly and this is pure
pure speculation i don't know angela
nagle so this is pure speculation but i
also think like what what is the
relationship between
you know these dynamics and depreciating
work opportunities on the left i think
it's a dan i mean i hope it doesn't
become a self-fulfilling prophecy i hope
she doesn't move to the right
but he already has well i don't one
basis of what are you saying
um i mean the publication that published
that piece was
uh sort of founded to become like the
intellect
but i know people who are trump yeah but
left people published in right places
sometimes that's not an inherently a
problem
so i'm technically i mean there's been
other issues that she's staked out
have she been staking other issues out
her association with um
spiked is another major red flag for me
um just like making friends with some
very questionable but actual positions
actual things yeah i mean okay what i
was gonna say about
killel normies was um when
that book first came out like i
acknowledge we all
most of us acknowledge that like this
kind of
uh shrill nasty social justice warrior
or whatever
is a thing on the liberal left and if
that was my
only experience of the left i might not
become a right winger but i might just
not do anything
which is also bad right right like i
acknowledge that that's a problem and
just i just want to add because i think
you're making a really important point
that was by the way that's the main
point of that book
people superficially or like her point
is is that because of tumblr the
alt-right exists okay
and that is part of what's going on in
that book and there's a little bit of
validity to that argument but that can
be grossly overstated but the bigger
more important point
if you're really reading it is the
material conditions of 2012
were such that there was a ripe time to
have a materialist
left and then what had become left in
the mainstream culture
was just these like shadow boxing
twitter games
and not solidarity and not politics and
that was correct and that was an
important critique
here's the thing like we should not
critique those people because they care
too much about like
transgender rights or whatever we should
critique them because they're
liberals and they have no class politics
and this isn't a problem that i've seen
on the socialist
left in any substantial way in the real
world
which makes me think it's it's been used
as a bit of a straw man i think in
leftist circles in a way that i don't
like also if that's your baileywick
i'm sorry i don't trust you what do you
mean
like if that's your thing your primary
issue
what the primary people uh sjws or
whatever
the the the meaning she was a private
to because she saw a problem in left
cult i mean i don't know that makes it
your belly wick but whatever i mean
yeah like now i lost my train of thought
because i'm angry
my point with the nagel thing was i i
i'm allergic to a lot of the tribalism
around all of this and i think right you
know
um and i finally we're allergic to some
of the tribalism even today we were
talking about like
rebecca tracer is very much not our
politics
profoundly so but the like oh she's
canceled because she opposed bernie like
i'm just not i don't like this and
i regardless of where it goes even with
politics i really
have very different politics from and i
i read kill all normies because of the
controversy around it and i
i understand why people were upset with
certain the um
causality implications of some of the
things she says right
um but i also thought like the her
tactical critiques of certain things
that
obviously play into outre propaganda i
think is i think
is a case that people need to be allowed
to make the thing that i
like bothered me about it wasn't it was
like my whole position on
that whole book was like i'm gonna wait
till the next thing she
like let's see more body of work i don't
really care to predict whether she's
going to go nazi or not like that's not
a gamer we've seen more yeah i don't we
don't play
that's what i'm saying right so we see
the we see the the
next piece that's where she decided to
go and then also
the the new jill lapore book basically
reproduced
the most i think vulgar and offensive
thesis
that you could pull like reduce nagel's
book to as
what the modern like culture war is but
that's on jill the poor not angela it is
it is i totally agree with that but the
problem is especially because jill the
poor frankly is a
more highly credentialed more important
platform person than anybody else in
this conversation
exactly that's why it's like god damn it
like right you just keep running into
like
to the point where like i i was on i was
basically on the i don't want to hear
about nego
um because i i think like the book is
fine for what it is
um and i don't think you can draw any
like larger
conclusions about it because who does
that really serve but
but i think even now like what is like
the correct critique of the immigration
piece is on the economics it's on some
of the a historicity
and it's on the fact that it's it's it's
90s style clintonian politics
literally as evidenced by the fact that
hillary clinton echoed the sentiments
right on the same
week that the piece came out so
immediately enough make
that critique and that was the problem
as soon as it came out i mean i was more
than happy to register because i
realized it was important for some
people because they you know sometimes
you know it's like they have a
perception that i have this huge
investment
because i like the book and i'm not
willing to play the vampire game with
her but it's like
i was totally willing i read the piece i
did i thought it was a i thought it was
i mean i'll keep using averages i
thought the piece sucked and so i said
so
and i and i and bashkar had a much more
elaborate thread on it which i pointed
people to
but it was like but then it was like and
this
proves that she's like himmler and it's
like okay
it's just stop there's nothing
ridiculous like just
argue it's clintonian it's a historical
those are those are
in my world those are plenty negative
terms without making up extra
certainly but like you gotta wonder why
she's doing that
i don't play that game to where that
coming from i don't play
why she would be so disingenuous because
i don't think she's ignorant about the
left
i think she's playing a game that's
really really creepy but what i was
gonna say before was
uh there are good faith disagreements
among
leftists about how to approach issues of
quote-unquote identity politics
so and this is something that sean
reminded me actually when we were
talking about killa normies like
you have to assume good faith on the
part of your fellow leftists
when you're arguing about these things
uh and
after that immigration take i don't
anymore she's not getting the benefit of
the doubt from me
okay yeah i hear that
and she she did not so you know yeah
i'm not i don't you know
some of this is just difference in
methodologies and and ways of argument
but i look
what i'll totally say is yeah i mean
that it was a bad piece
if she writes an amazing piece on um
climate change
uh i'll maybe change my you know
i'm always open to new evidence you know
my trouble you know but it's also like
she wrote some very good pieces for
current affairs as recently as like 2017
and it's like the ethos that's like
oh you tweet that out but she's canceled
because of this
 all that and frankly all that
in the opposite direction too
i'll tweet out a rebecca tracer piece if
it's good i don't
play that game and we need to
radically decrease that way of going
about things
across the board i emotionally
strategically politically bad luck
thanks for the call brother or maybe
people like this
or maybe or maybe uh no thanks for the
call
because it could have been fun and funny
yeah i mean we're trying to appeal like
this this is why like
the people who aren't as plugged into
this stuff right this is why you
like i think this is why you don't
engage well no no
i love brendan brennan with like the
smartest take fred is just like that's
why you just walk away from these
dumpster fires like i think when people
just use it as like sort of tribal
signifiers it confuses the out of
people
hundred percent and that's what we just
gotta get
the away from and also really is
like
we are all what does bodega boys say god
is working on all of us god's working
i mean my god like
and it's and and then we spend time on
you know look
gavin mcginnis that's a pretty
easy that's an easy one to figure out
most people certainly most people on the
left are a hell of a lot more
complicated
thanks man i don't remember
uh which i think it was the chapo
pre-recorded call-in episode but i think
matt christman had a good take on the
inner fighting of the left that
i found uh very what are you thinking
i i i can't do it justice because i
can't monologue like that guy
but basically that i want a drink
i love christmas no christmas i would
check that out though he's super astute
about stuff like that i might be more on
virgil's side in that discussion but
also i think they could have had it for
longer
let's do we gotta get going
