what do you do
if you are a a completely craven
republican media person
and the cia
has said that mbs was involved the turks
have said that mbs was involved
every expert on saudi arabia says
it's almost inconceivable that a
15-member
hit squad would travel to
an embassy chop up a journalist who's an
american
resident and mbs wouldn't know about it
what do you do if you are that craven
republican talker well you continue to
craven
and talk and um
here is hugh hubit hewitt
trying to come up with an explanation
for
how it is that the president of the
united states who's going on and saying
like
i needed to do it for the money we get
america needs this
incidentally not only does america not
need saudi oil
we buy i don't know what ten percent of
our oil from saudi arabia
saudi arabia could raise the prices of
oil internationally
uh by by choking off a supply from opec
but there's a report out today
that let's see an insider uh
business insider texas is about to
create opec's worst nightmare
there's been so much drilling that's
been going on in this country over the
past
even under the obama administration as
well
there are new pipelines that are getting
built all over texas
and in houston the u.s oil capital
shale executives are trying out
different superlatives to describe
what's coming
tsunami they call it a flooding of
biblical portions
an onslaught of supply are phrases that
get tossed around
so in other words saudi arabia couldn't
be in a weaker position right now
if we are so worried about
american oil i mean americans access to
oil then we should be nationalizing
those pipelines and those oil refineries
but here's hugh hewitt to explain why
donald trump is doing this
hey the cia has concluded that
mbs was behind this murder this has been
reporting
uh this has been reported by our news
outlet nbc news
among a number of others including the
new york times and the washington post
why is donald trump brushing off an
assessment by his own intelligence
community
well i have to i have to be cautious
here because the cia is sometimes as
wrong as it was with its national
intelligence estimate about iran's
weapons of mass destruction in 2007.
sometimes reporters even great ones at
my colleagues at the washington post and
nbc
get fat information by the cia which is
incomplete to advance the narrative by a
particular constituency
to lie to the press and attack the
president there there is often oh my
gosh
the agency often asked david ag nations
of the washington post they often push
out a narrative that they want
are you saying that all of the reporters
were duped by the cia at the
at nbc at the washington post yeah
the turks and from others but go on go
on i i again katie
it's very possible that khashoggi was
ordered murdered by mbs
all right so pause it for one second so
here's the first argument
you can't believe the cia okay but what
about the turks
well you can't believe the turks and the
cia what about every other assessment
that's come from any other expert on
this
well okay it's possible i've done enough
i've laid
that um that little patch of doubt but
wait a second let me move on to a
different argument i'm going to retreat
to another argument katie if i could
ordered murdered by mbs very possible
what the president said today when he
was going to the helicopter was to put
into context
that the saudi arabian relationship is
very important in the statement today
the very important second paragraph is
about the real enemy in the middle east
which is iran
which is the greatest state exporter of
terrorism the world and has murdered
hundreds of americans in conflict in
iraq
saudi arabia matters to us because
they're in alliance with the uae with
jordan egypt
israel in the united states mbs is not
saudi arabia
you've heard people like lindsey graham
and others tell the president be too
invested in the crown prince but he is
being very strategic so
he's being very strategic in protecting
mbs by also protecting saudi arabia
because it's so
uh it's so key to our relationship
here is sean hannity doing the
b team version of the same argument this
is
they're doing both the um fake
intellectual and just the blowhard
version of this exact same talking point
here's how sean hannity delivers that
talking point
that said i believe mbs did know
and probably ordered the killing of this
jamal khashoggi
here's the problem we have world war ii
we had to align with a mass murderer by
the name of joseph stalin
to defeat hitler right we didn't like
that alliance either
right now we have a historic moment
where
u.s israel egypt jordan
the emirates the saudis are now
perfectly aligned
against iranian hegemony and the threats
of
them getting a nuclear weapon with their
radical
ideology of wanting to destroy the world
and america and israel
all right um i think there should be as
you i agree with you about sanctions
i agree there needs to be a punishment
but i also agree with the president we
should not end this relationship
so apparently alienating
saudi arabia is the functional
equivalent of allowing
the nazis to continue to
create a huge empire that
threatens all of europe and frankly the
entire world
um the other thing i mean
what's fascinating about this is if this
was the reverse
the republicans were talking about how
weak
the u.s government is now that we cannot
at the very least just force mbs out
that we are so weak that the saudis are
now
pulling us around by our tail
this frame i think is is silly but it's
certainly the one that the republicans
would use
and
i i i there's
i i mean i think the the the problem
with this is self-evident i mean
if you basically say this uh
this coalition to fight the the
iranian threat
is too big to fail then what what can
you prevent them from doing
what what i mean what where does this
end
it's just absurd and it will have no
implications on anything nobody no
nobody no republican
voter cares about this they don't care
they don't all think that iran equals
nazi germany
oh no they all do that's why they won't
care about the killing of this uh oh i
see
the washington post columnist but i feel
like even they don't really care the
actual voters don't care that much about
iran
no i don't think they do not as much as
this is not
this is like the flip side right this is
the iran demonization helps
uh trump's position in this not vice
versa usually they're doing stuff
to demonize iran this they have to
expend
some of the demonization uh cachet
to protect whatever it is donald trump
is so hell-bent on protecting
it's uh i look forward to hugh hewitt uh
dedicating the rest of his career to cia
watching
yeah exactly he's super skeptical of
them
