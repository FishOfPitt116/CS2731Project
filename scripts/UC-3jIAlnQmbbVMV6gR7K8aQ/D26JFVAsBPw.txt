[Music]
here is uh this is a pretty uh
fun clip uh maddie hassan who has been
uh really really
um making uh sam harris look foolish
on twitter and in a way that is almost
um no i wouldn't even say that he's like
doing it during his breaks too
it is it's crazy like like maddie hassan
doesn't
it doesn't have enough to do uh it's
it's like one of those
it's like one of those guys like playing
like a you know one-man band
like off uh like you know just on the
side like oh incidentally bang
what if many hassan wasn't employed then
we'd be facing an entirely different set
of circumstances for him owning me on
twitter
what if it was all of the time he had in
the world because there was literally
nothing else for him to do we need to
confront that thought experiment
here is uh betty hassan talking to the
israeli ambassador to the united nations
on uh the question of a
two-state solution
to deal with the uh palestinian-israeli
conflict
do you support the two states you
suppose that i support direct
negotiations what you want to do now
is exactly what the palestinians are
trying no no the israeli government's
formal position
is a two-state solution they claim prime
minister nila claims to support a
two-state solution
do you he's ambassador to the united
nations yes or no very simple i support
i say i suppose positive now understand
how rude it is to ask a yes or no a
simple question
uh whether whether this ambassador
agrees with the stated policy of
uh his prime minister
but because that is completely out of
the bounds
to ask a yes or no question
yeah why is he being so mean to him why
is he trying to box him in
all right to the united nations yes or
no very simple i support
i say i support direct negotiations okay
negotiations to what ends do you support
a two-state solution at the end of those
negotiations like the rest of the world
like your prime minister claims to yes
or no
i support to end the incitement and to
have directions
i don't understand why it's so
complicated to say i do support
you i don't support the two states i
tell you why
i tell you why because here at the u.n
i'm used to
countries mainly trying to come to the
end of the conflict
without having a dialogue without your
government's position
i'm not giving pretty words anymore the
israeli government claims to support a
two-state solution but you clearly don't
because you won't say so on this show
it doesn't work that way if you want to
have any progress
in the middle east the palestinians
should stop the incitement
stop the payments for terrorists 500
million dollars a year
and enter the room and negotiate with us
directly they can come to the u.n
they should negotiate with a person who
doesn't say he supports a palestinian
state
i mean i am just so offended
to see uh maddie hassan i asked this guy
a yes or no question um all right let's
not
turn the uh likud apartheid government
segment into an entire michael tracy
subtweet
what
[Laughter]
projection
[Laughter]
wow i hadn't even occurred to me i mean
it's funny it's interesting well that
guy
you know honestly one guy's an
ambassador to the uh to the u n
and has a lot of uh there's there's some
mistakes right
ambassador to uh some other you know
place i don't know
notable individuals to notable
individuals
private notable individuals
i mean i i think like you know that is
the uh
the the problem if if the two-state
solution
is not even a concession
to uh that you can subscribe to publicly
before you sit down with the the
palestinians i mean i understand
uh the the constraints that might be on
an ambassador and you're getting into a
negotiating situation
but either it is the policy of the
israeli government or it isn't
and if you make
uh sitting down in negotiations
a prerequisite to getting to to getting
to the two-state solution
like that is um that's like uh
you know things are so bad they've got
to get a lot better
until you just get to or or things are
are so bad they got to get a lot better
till they are
horrible you know that's basically what
you're saying
why why is he doing that do you guys
have any insight
i think the reason well i think that's
it is it like they don't want to
concede anything well it's also why is
the government even saying it supports
the two states
that's the thing i mean i think medi was
being effective there and pitting him
against netanyahu but it's not exactly
like netanyahu reversed himself formally
during the last
israeli election himself he said he
didn't support two stated anymore so
it's
it's uh and then he went back after the
election it's obviously a lie and
pretend
but it's election time and i don't know
what dan and especially as these new
parties emerge like
even likud still has like less
like one percent of like let's pretend
about this process but the emergent
right-wing parties are quite formal
like no we're not going to do this so i
don't know
presumably he also just even i mean
everything sam said and also he probably
has a job plans after he's
ambassador the united states doesn't
want to piss off his own future
prospects
