swamp
you have a wonderful day bro and i'll
see you again soon
mf i want more iced tea

the deal standpoint where they thought
about it
[Music]
good evening just moments ago i spoke
with george w bush and
congratulated him on becoming the 43rd
president
of the united states and i promised him
that i wouldn't call him back this time
i offered to meet with him
as soon as possible so that we can start
to heal the divisions of the campaign
and the contest through which we've just
passed
almost a century and a half ago senator
stephen douglas
told abraham lincoln who had just
defeated him for the presidency partisan
feeling
must yield to patriotism i'm with you mr
president and god bless you
well in that same spirit i say to
president-elect bush
that what remains of partisan rancor
must now be put aside
and may god bless his stewardship of
this country
neither he nor i anticipated this long
and difficult road
certainly neither of us wanted it to
happen yet it came
and now it has ended resolved as it must
be resolved
through the honored institutions of our
democracy
over the library of one of our great law
schools is inscribed the motto
not under man but under god and law
that's the ruling principle of american
freedom the source of our democratic
liberties
i've tried to make it my guide
throughout this contest
as it has guided america's deliberations
of all the complex
issues of the past five weeks
now the u.s supreme court has spoken
let there be no doubt while i strongly
disagree with the court's decision i
accept it
i accept the finality of this outcome
which will be ratified next monday in
the electoral college
and tonight for the sake of our unity as
a people and the strength of our
democracy
i offer my concession i also accept my
responsibility which i will discharge
unconditionally to honor the new
president-elect and do everything
possible to help him bring americans
together
in fulfillment of the great vision that
our declaration of independence defines
and that our constitution affirms and
defends
let me say how grateful i am to all
those who supported me and supported the
cause for which we have fought

democracy bill nelson is hanging tough
in florida
it's the anniversary of camron
owning bill o'reilly we want to honor
that of course
we have a regulate with matt leck and
we also want to preemptively apologize
much love to stan lee but none of the
three of us know anything about him
so that's gonna be it peace and love to
stan lee but first we gotta get started
with
this
voter suppression is a main
vehicle of republican power and
dominance in american politics
the one smart move that democrats in the
house have announced
in the past couple of days after the
decent results in the midterm elections
is that they're going to be calling for
national voting rights legislation the
only smart and necessary move so far
voters suppression of course has a
profound and continuous history of this
in this country for most of our history
of course
people of color and women were not
allowed to vote period
non-landowning whites were not allowed
to vote for quite some time as well
and going back to the 2000 election
where george w bush won an election
that he lost with the assistance of the
supreme court
it defines the politics of our modern
era
i want to take a brief trip down memory
lane here
and be what i would call necessarily
petty
this is a clip from the day after the
2000 election
the election of course was in dispute
and
the bush campaign along with his brother
the then governor of florida
jeb bush and the highly crazy secretary
of state katherine harris
were setting about a strategy to make
sure not all votes were counted into
florida
just as rick scott and desantis are
attempting to do in florida today
and this is a then congressman
joe scarborough not a member of the
hashtag resistance
not a starbucks swilling egomaniac
but a gingrich republican egomaniac
how many dead men voted in florida
yesterday and how do we know
i can report to you and i've got i've
got the information here that all the
dead men and all the convicted felons
voted for bob wexler and i i think you
got like 75
percent congratulations on that by the
way those are two good constituencies
but you know again you could say this
about any stage
but but let's let's just wait and see
let's see how it returns
i was beginning joe to respect your
demeanor because this is a serious issue
let's not play politics and let's not
play games
joking with you bob don't lose your
sense of humor tonight
lesson joe scarborough obviously always
a deck
but in fact the republicans were always
playing politics and always playing
games which is how they steal elections
let's talk about some of those politics
and games in georgia jack kemp
the secretary of state oversaw his own
election
he halted 53 000 voter registrations
70 percent of those were likely people
of color using a faulty auto match
system
on the day of voting he accused
democrats of hacking his campaign
without any evidence
a tactic he's used before in the past he
purged many off of the voter rolls
along that along with that there were
significant errors and lines at the
polls
and the shutting down of polling
stations all in a concerted effort
to block mainly people of color from
voting for
his opponent or voting generally in fact
in north dakota
there was an attack on native american
voters upheld
in the supreme court by a empowered
republican majority with brett kavanaugh
a new voter id law in north dakota
required a residential address
and many native americans who reside in
reservations use po boxes therefore they
were unable to vote
in florida we're going into a mandatory
recount
rick scott without a shred of evidence
has accused
democrats of attempting to steal the
election in broward county
a largely democratic county around 25
000 votes were counted as blank for the
senate race
a significant number some believe that
this was because the ballot line for the
senate race
was placed underneath a long list of
texts obscuring the place to vote
florida senator uh nelson's
lawyers have considered that machine
errors caused many of these votes
not to be counted and there were
significantly
other irregularities in florida voters
fortunately voted to restore the voting
rights of felons but they were not
restored in time for this election
voter suppression is something the left
needs to take seriously
because fundamentally we are talking
about democracy in the fullest sense
and we are talking about the capacity to
build a left
coalition which will rest on the ability
of everyone to participate in a
political process whether
of course we're talking about the right
of assembly the right to protest longer
term organizing but certainly also the
right
to vote the republican
party has presided over
a strategic assault on access
jury mandarin the roberts court gutted
the voting rights act
voter id laws and added restrictions on
voting
target people of color and young people
and even in democratic-controlled areas
like new york
the ballot has plenty of problems and
there are serious
difficulties in voting and reforms that
are necessary
along with attempts to suppress the vote
we've allowed our electoral
infrastructure to crumble every election
we hear stories of untrained poll
workers
providing faulty information major
issues with polling machines
which is by the way which is why by the
way we're predominantly
controlled by which are by the way
predominantly controlled by three
private companies that's right three
private companies own
most of the voting machines we're voting
on we need to fix election laws
so we can vote in a orderly universal
and civil rights guaranteed manner the
structure of our political system is a
significant
bent against people we have all know
about how the electoral college of
course
has led to two republican presidents
becoming president while losing a
majority of the votes
since 2000 we also know that the power
of the senate
is entirely disproportionate between
populations
and favors smaller wider more rural
states
dominated by even more narrow corporate
interests
in 2000 the election in florida was no
doubt compromise but an electoral
electoral practices and a supreme court
that literally invoked the 14th
amendment
one guaranteeing civil rights one
guaranteeing equal rights
under the law a prime
force of civil rights and equality in
this country something that republicans
on the court
have done everything to undermine they
use to suggest that a lack of uniformity
in voting standards
would violate george w bush's civil
rights under the 14th amendment
this is literally the case they wrote
they also wrote in the case the five
to four republican majority that
the reasoning in this case should not be
used for further cases this was a
one-off to steal a presidential election
and of course this is a country where
political and economic decisions are
often made by people who are
unaccountable
to the public will this
fight against voter suppression and for
true equality in the voting process
is inseparable from a broader struggle
for economic democracy
and broader stakeholder equality and
justice across
the country we know that in order to get
people
out in order to sustain the types of
victories we're talking about
we need more people engaged republicans
know that too
and that's why they've set out
strategically and relentlessly
to limit that engagement and that's why
it's entirely
inseparable from the trump
administration's ethnic cleansing of
america through its immigration policies
it's entirely inseparable
from the conspiracy theory right-wing
nutto sphere
of voter fraud and a broader effort to
close
limit and block democracy indeed to put
democracy in chains
so that capitalism can be unbridled with
zero accountability
a vote a fight for voting rights can be
the first step into a broader fight
for true democracy where people have not
only the ability to exercise their vote
in the political and civic sphere but in
the economic one
as well let's get to it all right guys
anything you want to add in on this
as we return i would i would just add
that um
there's a very significant uh political
opportunity that we have here on the
left to
make these contradictions very clear and
that if we're supposed to be a democracy
if we're supposed to be a country that's
ruled by the will of the people
making that demand that the people's
voice isn't being heard making the
the point that the voting system is
ridiculously
difficult there's impediments and there
are outright attempts to
steal elections in this country is a
really great wedge issue
in the united states and more more in
this country people are feeling more and
more powerless and more and more feeling
that we are living in a
crisis of democracy it's very clear that
the answer to the crisis of democracy is
more democracy
and to make that demand very clear um
that like the founding myths
and the founding ideas of this country
that we say
wait a second these are not being held
up as the left
and that we make those demands to extend
like the glorious ideas of a republic or
democracy
into their actual form rather than the
kind of very plutocratic system that has
been developed over the past 200 years
right and don't concede al gore
matt uh yeah i would like to co-sign
griscom's
comments on the extension of those
liberties that we
uh at least say we agree with also i'm
just struck with
seeing young joe scarborough like that
and thinking of all the uh sort of
younger conservatives
that i've been harassing on twitter for
the last like three years
and knowing that in 10 years from now
they're going to be invited into
probably cable shows to be like oh well
florida's gone now
what does that mean for the gop they'll
be like well i think we need to do this
and that
and act like responsible adults i mean
man it's right
right the people same people getting
their start now posting
4chan memes supporting fascism
kavanaugh was in the brooks brothers
riot explain the brooks bill is right oh
i
should say this we are preparing an
illicit history which is going to drop
soon
for patrons on the florida election and
what put george w bush in office and
if you look at it objectively people use
i mean
i think now it's becoming more
widespread right samantha power even
said
if i was ambassador united nations and
someone gave me the conditions of voting
in georgia
about you know a foreign country i would
demand that there be hearings on it
right now of course she might
add if they were also not an ally of the
united states but whatever
that being said that's become sort of
more broadly recognized but if you go
back to florida
the fact that this happened in front of
all of us in a way that
was an object i mean
a presidential candidate's brother
presides over a state where there's a
disputed election
it's clear from all indications that if
all ballots were voted clearly and
fairly al gore would be president would
win florida
the ballot counting is stopped by a
supreme court
who is a is a supposedly conservative
states rights court
overruling a state court in florida
evoking the 14th amendment which they
always
don't want to use for anything
substantive of course would never want
to use that for civil rights
to stop a vote count in its tracks
so that george w bush is installed as
president
and of course you know 16 years later or
18 years later can be seen
dancing with ellen degeneres with a
couple of
global invasions torture regimes
economic meltdown
environmental catastrophe and katrina
thrown in between
and that's how we do things yeah that's
also why
 joe scarborough and have a little
bit of historical awareness
people yeah these people are bad for
their their whole lives
turns out uh it's just some other i
think there's a few more
uh people in this brooks bush riot but
uh roger stone of course
roger stone who uh matt
yeah we uh we were we had on the list a
mercedes schlep his wife is also a rnc
person and i think those people like i
get a strong nazi vibe from them like
the way he was talking to michael steele
about how uh
he should accept being called that he
was just rnc
chair for because he was black yeah it's
like why are you so offended
um yeah he was but anyway yeah and
that's what struck me is these people
they last and then they just mature into
apparently respectable parts of our
media environment
that's exactly right all right well
let's get to something on the completely
opposite end of things let's get to
the shout out which i see matt you very
helpfully put up on screen for me but
first we have the great dj danarky who's
the beat maker and the
mega genius mega producer
behind all of the
rich sonic life of the tnbs experience
the shout out music please let's get to
uh the shout out shout out shout out
creepy shout out shout out
shout out weird i think that's creepy
it's incredible shout out shout out
shout out shout out this
is crazy
[Music]
this is out of control the city of
baltimore has become the first major
city to ban
water privatization we have a statement
here from rihanna eckel she's a maryland
organizer for food and water watch uh
it's actually this is a little bit of a
tricky angle for me baltimore voters
made history by voting in favor of
passing question e
a city charter amendment that bans the
privatization of the city's water and
sewage systems this is from a report
uh in i don't know the site the
baltimore city council voted
unanimously to ban water privatization
early this year as of 11 15 pm
baltimore voters voted 77 percent in
favor of this amendment with 91 percent
of precincts reporting
this confirms that baltimore is now the
first major city in the country to amend
its charter
to prohibit the sale and lease of the
city's water and
sewage systems with water corporations
circling around baltimore over the past
several years and ramped up
privatization employees last spring
and a federal administration hell-bent
on propping
up corporate power over people's rights
it's momentous
that this city has voted to keep its
water public said rihanna eckel
a maryland organizer for food and water
watch this is part of a report and
what's the site here
uh food and oh yeah food and water watch
uh this is their site so
props to them props to the city of
baltimore and how the hell
has not every single city and
municipality and town and hamlet and
village
and the country not already past this
you know we talked to matt christman
about sewer socialism yes we did
water pipe socialism and your kid isn't
going to be lead poisoned
socialism is a probably a pretty potent
form of socialism indeed
i agree and you know house i have to say
these kind of
initiatives were so important in these
midterm elections too because
oftentimes you know politicians are the
ones who are standing behind you know
policies that are incredibly popular you
know we saw lots of really great ballot
expansions uh you know as we saw in
idaho for example with medicaid
expansion and across the country
definitely so it's definitely something
that's very exciting to see and there's
a lot of great
the the the success story i mean first
just just to jump in real quick
rashida talib alexandria ocasio-cortez
we've got some great sound to them we're
going to play for patrons in the post
game
uh alina alain o'mear o'mara i believe
her name is from minnesota she endorsed
bds today
there's great energy coming into
congress
uh but the picture for being realistic
federally was mixed
i think it was decent but it was mixed
but
across the board in terms of local
initiatives and ballot measures
that's where you can really start to see
that actual left momentum
for reclaiming the commons giving
everybody health care
and actually also even in places like
houston some serious reforms in the
criminal justice system
so uh yeah i agree with you uh david
that
down down ballot is could not be more
important
we're gonna go do a segment in a second
called the global brief but first we
have a couple of uh pitches we want to
talk to you guys about
before we test out this new segment um
and i guess yeah we could convince yeah
it's perfect so guys um we continue
to grow on patreon we had
a little bit of a fall off at the end of
this month and things have been
a little bit mixed going in i mean
nothing i mean look at the other day
we're doing great we have a lot of
people supporting us and we've been able
to
grow and do what we want to do but the
next goal
which we're about 300 shy of is 2000
patrons we've got to hit that goal
to make some things happen as soon as
possible including the food bucket
challenge so
if you haven't yet step up become a
patron at patreon.com
tnbs patreon.com
there is a whole alternative
uh history and way of doing
politics inside the patreon you're going
to get really grounded in global
politics you're going to laugh and have
a huge amount of fun
with the clips and comedy bits and
call-ins and discord questions that we
have in the post game
what would you guys add about the
patreon content in some ways it's
so much uh that i just it's
it can be a little hard to convey to
people like
how much more show and participation
you're getting
well it's a very good binge uh resource
i think
i could imagine if i wasn't producing
them myself
sitting back and downloading about 10
straight illicit histories and just
going through that you get a global
global history if you're a majority
report listener for instance uh you
don't really get
we don't really cover global stuff on
that show as much as we do especially in
the illicit
yeah definitely yeah i mean and you know
from the illicit histories to different
theory readings i mean there's just a
lot of opportunities to really
take a deep dive into leftist left-wing
history
politics and philosophy and also you
know we really have
been able to cultivate a wonderful
community of people definitely that's an
amazing thing that's a really great
resource getting access to the discord
getting access to the conversations uh
people have raised a huge amount of
money they've started campaigns they've
built significant community in the
discord
over the next couple of weeks we're
going to be unlocking several illicit
histories
um to spread out into the
broader world as we sort of ramp up our
next campaign here
um and that's also going to be
coinciding with live shows which i'm
going to talk about in a second and
um i i haven't really want to talk about
this while it's been a process but this
book that i'm writing for zero books
is getting much closer to being finished
and when that publishes that's obviously
going to be a whole other
process that will be synchronized with
this as well so we're really proud of
what we're doing
and also it's a it's a comedy an
entertainment product
i mean it's it's amazing i think the
synthesis that the team
and this really amazing constellation of
people that we've been able to pull
around us is achieving so
please join us at patreon.com tnbs
also please join us february 1st at the
bell house for our first
live show so far we have
alona minkowski bashkar sunkara
and trevor boleyw ricky rawls joining us
we've sold a lot of tickets um i'm not
gonna
you know i'm not gonna lie to you guys
there's definitely still like it's not

designed it yet

live show we have one other

that might be coming out for this as
well i don't want to
confirm it until it's there but there's
there's a possibility out there but
we're gonna do we're gonna have uh
audience participation we're gonna
put your obama impressions to the test
uh we're gonna do a lot of different
segments it
my point being is that it's uh i think
it would be fun
if we just went up there and did a show
in front of a live audience
but that's not what it's going to be
it's going to be a couple hours
different kind of show different kind of
experience and we'll definitely come out
and say hi and and uh you'll also get to
meet
i would say even more importantly a
bunch of other amazing people
that are coming literally from all over
the country
people came out of the mar-a-lago summit
with very high hopes
that's exactly right so
get your ticket today if you're a patron
there's a coupon code
uh it's time and of course uh there's
also subscribing to the show on itunes
going to michael brook's show youtube
channel and just continuing to seed and
spread
the word today at trader joe's i was
going and buying something this guy next
to me said hey man do i know you and i
said i
don't know because i'm still not like
really used to
people recognizing me on the street and
he's like are you michael brooks and i
said yeah
hey man how you doing he goes i'm a
patron
and i said of majority reporter tnb i
know i did say that
he said he said yeah no i'm a patron of
tnbs and i said oh thanks man
and i said how did you find the show and
he said oh i found it through a majority
report but to be honest i like you a
little bit better than sam
and i was just like
let's uh record that and make that an
instagram story the one that matters is
me
i'm the only one that matters that's
exactly what
i said
oh that's good all right
people need who aren't watching on
youtube they need to be getting all
these sound drops with the
instrumentals man it's important
uh we got to figure out a way i think of
integrating that into the show
uh because the the sound drops are like
a whole other
story oh i think uh durian phone call uh
calls to guests we're gonna be doing
that
yeah we should definitely be doing that
and people who are who listen to the
show
will know what we're talking about
shortly um
so okay we have a new segment we're
gonna do we're gonna test out
uh just to put a little bit of structure
around it called the global brief
because there's obviously a lot of
things that we're covering and things we
will be covering
uh not this time and in the coming weeks
like the proposal of an independent
european army
by a menuet the wet dream of msnbc
and the loath pretentious right-wing
neo-liberal of everybody else the
new uh uh series of uh murders
uh in gaza by israeli forces uh
new revelations about the khashoggi
murder but tonight we're gonna focus on
brazil
and tehran brazil and iran
first in brazil and we're going to keep
covering these stories
uh you know in this integrated way so
jr bolsonaro has been you know
moving forward at a steady pace in
anticipation of his
inauguration appointments of extreme
neo-liberals at economic ministries
which will take
uh aim at everything from getting rid
of and attacking labor rights and quote
unquote pension reform which have long
been austerity and neoliberal goals
in brazil you already see the business
press
the business sector and the brazilian
court system of which
uh were of course very helpful to
bolsonaro and he's already promised them
a pay raise
uh you're already seeing indications
that they might have some plans
to keep him in check a little bit they
want to move away from the talk of
ethnic social and political cleansing
which of course they had no problem with
in supporting him
and towards the specific agenda of
selling off the amazon
of taking aim at public education of
far-right austerity which will of course
benefit brazilian oligarchs and western
multinationals
so that is what's happening in brazil
even as
bolsonaro's son as an example as
recently said
he wants to get rid of all of brazil's
communists which is
what happened in indonesia so
there are movements forming in brazil
the leader of the landless movement said
they got rid of the
brazilian military dictatorship and
they'll deal with bolsonaro too
amazonian indigenous communities are
forming
uh responses to the bolsonaro regime's
plans
with of course uh the eager
participation of u.s and canadian
corporations to destroy the
amazon which will be a travesty for
human rights and pose global
environmental threat
and this also comes on the heels of new
revelations about the political
imprisonment of lula de silva who is the
most prominent political prisoner in the
world
we're going to start by watching this
clip from a couple of months ago from
the real news network
to help contextualize the latest news
about the political imprisonment of the
former two-term president luis
inacio lula de silva
silva supposedly accepted a bribe
from the brazilian construction company
order brecht
while he was still president where no
evidence was actually produced of this
crime
the supreme court's ruling does not
exhaust lula's appeal
but it probably puts an end to his
presidential campaign
in which he is the front-runner the
ruling
was limited to whether lula was to be
imprisoned while he continued his appeal
of the conviction both supporters and
opponents
of the former president hit the streets
this week
in tens of thousands also shortly before
the ruling
two generals urged the court
to rule against lula general louise
gonzaga schroeder lesser even threatened
with the possibility of a military coup
should lula be allowed to remain free
so this is was of course true and
again lula was convicted
on a stunningly flimsy charge
judge sergio morrow the politically
motivated
uh vindictive prosecutor of lula has
accepted a job as justice minister in
the incoming fascist government
of bolsonaro and in a newspaper
interview on sunday november 11th i'm
quoting now from brian muir in brazil
wire
general vilas boaz gave an interview to
fola des san paulo newspaper in which he
admits to threatening the supreme court
against issuing a decision favorable to
the former president
quote i recognize that there was an
episode in which we really pushed the
limits
which was a tweet i made on the eve of
the supreme court vote on the issue of
lula
we were conscious we consciously knew we
were on the edge but we felt that the
situation could escape our control
if we did if i did not publicly express
myself
because other people military reservists
and citizens identified with us and were
speaking
more emphatically responding to the
interview pt president that's the
workers party
glacia hoffman accused vilo bolas
of hatching a scheme involving sectors
in the media and the judiciary to remove
ex-president luis inacio lula de silva
from the presidential race
that resulted in the jr bolsonaro
victory
general vilas bois's statements revealed
a political plot against lula
he makes it clear there was interference
in the federal supreme court decision
we're going to continue to follow the
story and brazil generally
and we need to encourage every single
self-proclaimed democrat frankly but
certainly anybody coming in with a
progressive profile
to join bernie sanders in condemning the
political prosecution in lula
and condemning the bolsonaro government
and condemning u.s corporations that
have
backed the fascist austerity right
in brazil and the protection of
democracy
as well as the freeing of lula in brazil
now
let's move to iran donald trump
fulfilled a campaign promise a promise
that i think no doubt
all republican candidates would have
fulfilled
in tearing up the iran deal the iran
deal was of course the deal negotiated
by the obama administration and its
european chinese and russian partners
that
established a reproach mod to some
extent with iran
it was working and certified by all
relevant international bodies
and there was no indication whatsoever
that iran was not complying with the
deal the trump administration
brought in ancillary issues to appease
their extremist base as well as israel
saudi arabia and the united arab
emirates
in destroying the steel and now it poses
a significant threat to
the world and also a huge
damage to normal everyday iranian
citizens as sanctions kick back in let's
watch briefly this report from al
jazeera
because it among other things does have
some good burns from hassan rouhani
against donald trump hassan rouhani of
course
iran's president and then dave griscom
is going to fill in a little bit of the
details on the human stakes
of the return of sanctions one of the
reasons president donald trump gave to
pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal
and reimpose sanctions on iran was the
country's
growing military influence in the middle
east was it and
sorry to pull a sam here but this had
nothing to do with the agreement the
agreement was on the new
killer program period in fact
republicans and other right-wing forces
tried to introduce
poison pills having to do with things
like intermediary ballistic missiles
as a way of destroying the deal when it
was achieved and agreed to
back during the negotiations so this
argument
is an ancillary lie and it has nothing
to do
with the agreement go ahead influence in
the middle east
and their ballistic missiles program
so it was perhaps not a coincidence that
iranians scheduled one of their largest
military exercises of the year
on the same day as u.s sanctions kicked
back in
multiple air defense units took part in
war games spanning half a million square
kilometers
across the country and as the missiles
took flight
on the ground the iranian president
lobbed insults
at the american president
i don't think any other administration
in the history of the united states has
been as opposed to the law in
international treaties
i have not seen any administration in
the white house as racist as these
people and you cannot expect anything
else from them
so first of all props to the al jazeera
english translator with the
best deadpan translation of
rouhani's very solid burns there i just
want to say look
obviously we can do business with iran
and we can make
deals with the iranian government and
there are
even some areas of the iranian
revolution that one can have some
sympathy with
and there's different aspects of the
iranian leadership
rouhani is a very different figure than
saying ahmadinejad that being said none
of this is predicated on justifying or
excusing the abuses of the iranian
regime
abuses which of course include savage
and
vicious abuses of baha'i human rights
structural misogyny and also
historically back after in the beginning
stages of the revolution
a mass killing and murder of leftists
and liberals
so no sort of soft pedaling of the
iranian government's abuses
that said uh it does not compare to
saudi arabia and this agreement was a
great achievement
and sanctions and of course even even
worse the threat of war can only affect
and hurt normal people and david you're
going to speak that a little bit
yeah i mean so so far these added
sanctions on iran have been very
devastating and of course it's always
difficult to get hard numbers on these
questions
but the stories that are coming out of
iran are quite tragic predominantly one
of the most horrific stories has been
about the importation of medicine into
iran um
and that's not only from american
pharmaceutical companies that's also
from
countries like germany and that's also
not just uh when it comes to
completed medicine that also comes for
many of the materials that are needed
for medicine and this is something that
can be very devastating for somebody
if you're on like a routine when you're
taking medicine to have it interrupted
and replaced with something else can be
very devastating especially for people
who are dealing with serious heart
disease
or mental illness i mean these can be
serious life or death issues
um you know just like watching the
situation it's very frustrating to see a
lot of the rhetoric
in the united states it might not be of
a surprise to the people in this room
but again the iaea after the inspections
of iran
gave them you know perfect rating you
know every single
every single time and there's no there's
not been any kind of ratcheting up
of any kind of nuclear activity you know
in fact you know we can go back to the
iran deal and it was you know as an
achievement in bringing iran
into the global community it was a very
punitive deal for
a country that uh when you really start
looking into like the actual allegations
against a nuclear program
aren't as never any proof that iran even
had a weapons
exactly and iran's just no that's a
really important point so i just want to
elaborate for a second
under npt the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty
there was this goes back to the 60s or
maybe even the 50s this idea of atoms
for peace
now i have my own innate concerns about
nuclear power frankly from an
environmental and public health
standpoint i know that
there's plenty of debate about that but
i have a lot of concerns being that as
it may
the notion of that original agreement
was that
all countries would be incentivized to
not develop weapons programs but would
be supported in the peaceful use
of that technology for energy and of
course nuclear power is definitionally
dual use
it's all the same stuff and it has to do
with speeding up of fuel cycles which
was what makes it weapons great
all available serious evidence not
cooked books from neoconservative think
tanks
or israeli or saudi intelligence there
was
never ever any
clear let alone definitive evidence
there was some speculative evidence
and frankly it would make a lot of sense
why iran would want that capacity from
the perspective of its own
self-preservation
but no evidence including
u.s cia intelligence estimates ever
demonstrated
that iran was on the path to a weapon
that has never been demonstrated
ever and you know and it's just and it's
something that's very important to
remember when we're talking about
the very serious human cause that's
right so in addition to the the medical
issues
you know we're also seeing what's
happened with sanctions
has been a collapse of the rio which is
a currency in iran
which lost over 70 percent of its value
trading internationally since they've
ratcheted up these sanctions not only do
you have that but now because
all of america's allies are unable to
process payments
from iran global trade you know for iran
is absolutely devastating which means
that when
we live in a global economy now you go
to the supermarket and you look at the
food that you eat
and you know you'll be very surprised to
find out that a lot of it doesn't come
from america
and it's not a surprise that a country
is uh populist and as wealthy as iran
which is 81 million people
imports food as well and that's
something that is also being restricted
which will have very significant
consequences
and you know let's not forget that um
pompeo uh of the trump administration
said recently in his interview
secretary of state that the leaders of
iran would have to choose
between letting their people eat or
continuing to fund terrorism
so i mean that's the state of the
discourse right now and even though
the same strategy against venezuela
which are also threatening exactly as
well
100 and just you know one more added
point is even though a lot of european
powers
are very upset with the united states
for their actions because of the immense
financial power of the united states
private corporations have private
companies
are having a lot of difficulty even if
their nations might want to defy or push
back against trump's uh
um you know blustering barbarity you
know and it's just something that we
really need to
pay a lot of attention to and to not let
this kind of rhetoric get ratcheted up
don't forget this needs to be another
talk about litmus test for democratic
presidential candidates in 2020
are you going to try to save and restore
the obama iran deal well it has to be
non-negotiable and and the fact is is
that
you talk about this and people forget
but there's politics in iran too
that's right and you know you have
someone who's like a moderate like
rouhani
right um who's been in power for a
little while now they're it's coming up
they're gonna have a new president in
2021.
and you imagine you know a new iranian
president coming up and having sit at
the table and try to negotiate a new
deal with the united states after we
backed out even though iran did nothing
to trigger that backing out um you know
his supreme leader
said specifically back in 2014
he said you have my permission to
negotiate but you should never trust the
united states he literally
inculcated himself and and
actually essentially projected out what
happened and it's like even from the
trump administration's
uh idiotic uh you know strategy
this is the worst strategy ever because
all that it's done has really
empowered the hardliners of course in
iran and that's you know that's
something
maybe that's what people like john
bolton want because they're warmongers
which is a very
terrifying and serious thing you have to
because because the
reality is is that i mean you know there
is always the reality that
you know the hardliners in iran and
likud and israel
and the neocons here and the you know
and the saudi uh you know even the even
more aggressive contingent the mass
murder contingent of mbs and so on
they always have the convergence of
interest
but yes i thank you so we have to go
actually we're staying right on david
griscom as he swigs his beer
gets into mode here there was actually
before we do this let's let's play this
sound
because there was uh announced today
if you're an idiot and you're a resident
of virginia or new york you'd be really
excited that two states
supplicated them that just sort of
literally bent the knee this actually
was an almost sort of
futile medieval feudalism
sort of fused with reality tv show
pageantry
in a process of states trying to
beg and bribe one of the most predatory
and dangerous corporations on planet
earth
to come to their states and hand out
some what will almost certainly be some
extremely punitive and abusive jobs
and amazon confirmed they're coming to
uh virginia and god jesus christ
queens new york they're going to ruin
the subway we need to do everything we
can to block this deal if you're in new
york and if you're in virginia too i
just don't know much about it
but i do know that ralph northam the
governor of virginia
is a mega cuck uh and this is his video
uh thanking amazon this is maybe one of
the most pathetic things i have seen
from a public official and i have to say
as far as the democratic party brand
goes
the symmetry here between al gore being
luck
and war strongly reject
the supreme court stealing the election
from me but
as you know senator thaddeus said in the
18th century
government goes on i see a little bit of
a theme here with
ralph northam in this pathetic homage to
amazon
hello i'm virginia governor ralph
northam
i'm proud to announce a big win for
virginia
amazon has selected the commonwealth as
home to a major new headquarters
earlier this year virginia put together
a proposal to amazon
that we believe represents a new model
of economic development for the 21st
century
and i'm excited to say that our
innovative approach was successful
the vast majority of virginia's
incentive package
represents smart investments in our
education
and transportation infrastructure amazon
will invest
more than two billion dollars to deepen
its roots in the commonwealth
lay ground on a new headquarters and
create thousands of jobs
this is the result of an unprecedented
state
local and regional partnership that
includes our neighbors in maryland
and the district of columbia as a result
of our coordinated efforts
all of virginia will see the benefits we
are proud that amazon has recognized the
tremendous amount virginia has to offer
one of the strongest tech pools in the
nation a
world-class higher education system and
a stable competitive business climate
virginia is an inclusive state and we
want
everyone to feel welcome here no matter
your religion
nationality or orientation i'm proud to
welcome amazon to its new home here in
the commonwealth
thank you so much so david
after you saw that clip is this going to
affect your segment
do you want to give a little bit more
credit for the amazon deal
well because now of course we are taking
that
segment of ralph northam being a mega
cook for amazon
and we're transitioning to the gem
system
that is the david griscom economic
minute
well i mean this is very clear that this
is what democracy
doesn't look like yeah you know what
megan daya dia jacobin rightfully called
the hunger games
of amazon are finished and just to give
people the context of this you know
around 28
of the american population lived in a
city state or municipality which was
involved in this competition
um which is you know a very incredible
amount of folks when you think about it
and of course they chose the two most
likely candidates
that you could expect for amazon to pick
washington dc
is crystal city virginia which um and
in long island city and queens new york
um
you know that was pretty much what
everyone thought they were going to do
up front right let's talk about what
they did
amazon basically got detailed plans
economic pitches
and updates from around 28 of the
america's population
for free which means that i mean
seriously like incredible like
architecture firms
provided you know schematics of proposed
headquarters to amazon for free or which
were paid for
by state and local governments um and
again you know they took
those two most likely candidates now why
did they do this
amazon got huge tax breaks and subsidies
from their new homes
because new york and virginia felt like
they were winning something
by bringing amazon into their community
what are we winning bro
well what are we winning we're winning
we're winning a devastating increase in
housing prices
right increased stratification of wealth
in
two areas which are have huge
stratifications of wealth already but i
have a question
yes what proximity will the new amazon
headquarters have to public housing
projects
oh they're just from like a synergy
point of view there's gonna be a lot of
synergy between the largest corporation
and we'll talk about that later in our
gulag section yes we will but i just
wanted to
i just want to hit real quick a couple
of these numbers
because i'm gonna tell you something
that surprised you remember that blood
blubbering idiot that we were just
listening to
she actually ended up getting a better
deal than andrew cuomo
when it comes down to it new york is
going to basically be giving 2.5 billion
dollars
in tax breaks and subsidies uh to
to amazon while virginia even though
they are going to be changing the name
of crystal city
to national landing they're getting a
rebrand of the neighborhood yes so
they're going to change the name so
that's like the
city to national landing national
landing what kind of name upgrade is
that
so new york is going to be giving them
about 1.2 billion dollars from the state
excelsior tax credit
around 300 million for the state capital
grant and new york city is going to
provide them with around
1 billion dollars in tax credits through
the relocation and employment assistance
program and this is a program that has
not been used on this scale ever before
now let's not forget by the way that
this is around 25 000
jobs that the state is uh that we're
going to be getting over the course of
the next 25 years right and we're
providing 2.5 billion dollars
um virginia the similar 25 uh 25 000
jobs over the next 15 years and we're
talking most of those jobs aren't going
to roll in for another
decade so they're going to hire around
400 people in 2019
maybe around 800 people in 2020 and then
we'll see around a thousand new hires
supposedly
um you're in you're under these like
fulfillment center
like sweatshop jobs or these no these
are these are these are supposedly going
to be
high paying jobs around 150 000 which
let's remember
something new york city and washington
dc aren't cities that are
really lacking for those who aren't
really lacking when it comes to
high-paying
uh jobs like that what really is missing
in those areas is the middle
and i just wanna make a couple things
clear about these negotiations
one amazon of virginia can leave within
five days at any time in this agreement
which
would just because of that ralph northam
video
would be pretty funny because they were
just like yeah usually this isn't going
to work
and but let's remember for a second that
you know his competition was andrew
cuomo somebody who said
that he's going to change his name to
amazon cuomo
if need be and you know you wouldn't be
surprised to find a tough negotiator
like that also you know really stuck his
foot in the ground
and you know ended up acquiesing to give
jeff bezos a personal helipot
helipad launcher in uh in queens but
don't worry
there's a limit on how many times that
the state will pay for it it's only 120
times a year
oh that's okay so there was something so
i mean this is something that was just
like i just wanted to hit this real
quick because it's like you know these
decisions were not made with public
input
right and because of the contradiction
in our society between use value and
exchange value
what you're going to see is property
values rising dramatically in all these
communities
and landlords do not particularly um are
not going to be searching out for like
the bottom of this market they're going
to be searching for the top
right which means that rents are going
to increase over across the board
and we're going to see more and more
empty spaces if you walk through midtown
manhattan that's something that you'll
learn
right is that high valuation and high
speculation does not necessarily
flatten out the market in fact it will
leave storefronts empty while
um owners and landlords can leverage the
position that
manhattan is like empty it's like a
ghost wayne reed
starbucks empty and
some sort of like bars
occasionally
exactly i mean this is something that's
medicine bulbs it's something that's
very worrying
edison bulbs i definitely had to suppose
well maybe that would be the one thing
if amazon could get rid of the ms
they should come yeah that's true i
would support that
can i i'm just gonna you have anything
else you want to hit on that
um you know i just want to hit one last
thing it's just that
you know we need to be very worried
about these kind of investments
especially when you hear a lot of talk
about vocational training and coding
training
for the local students because people
talk about these things as if they're
going to be high paid jobs
what we're seeing more and more is that
there's actually is a surplus of code
you know people who have skills when it
comes to coding in the united states and
more and more what these
major corporations are trying to do is
they're trying to create a larger
reserve
army of technical workers which means
that they're trying to suppress the
wages blame reserve army to people
these are people who aren't employed but
they are could potentially be employed
and these are sort of used as a threat
for people who are working in an
environment who want to push their wages
up or to get better conditions
because the threat basically being if
you quit or you know we fire you
there's 10 other people who want to take
your job and it's something that
capitals very much try to cultivate
because they use this competition
between workers as a threat to
to lower wages amongst the the working
class so you know we see these kind of
investments and the promises that we
make we really need to
remember that amazon is not a company
that's really looking out for this
community
don't forget what happened this year in
seattle where amazon fought against a
very modest
head tax increase and basically poisoned
the city council
in seattle and you can definitely expect
that coming to virginia um
new york and basically this subsidized
program now we have lobbyists and
right next to the capitol subsidized by
the virginia government for amazon and i
mean you know
it's an absolute disaster what we've
seen in a real capital that was also an
absolute disaster is what i just got
texted by richard wolff
i didn't want to get into it he says he
will see you on the 27th
bring it you just said bring it to
richard wolff
that guy's gonna come in here and kill
you i just wanna also say i mean
there is an initiative in the new york
state senate by or excuse me in the
legislature by assemblyman ron kim
this is from a report by david serota
democratic assemblyman ron kim has
announced that he'll introduce
legislation to slash new york's economic
development subsidies and use the money
to buy up and cancel student debt
a move he said would repo that would
provide a bigger boost to the state's
economy
the legislation says kim would halt any
cuomo administration offer of taxpayer
money to amazon
which could reap up to one billion
dollars in tax incentives if it moves
to long island city giving jeff bezos
hundreds of millions of dollars is a
moral waste of taxpayer money money
when it's crystal clear that the money
would create more jobs and more economic
growth when it would be used to relieve
student debt so i that's an
incredibly important initiative and this
is the type of thing that
because you got rid of the idc and there
is actually democratic control the state
senate that you might be able to get
some sort of momentum behind
this is also an opportunity i
there was a time when bill de blasio was
undoubtedly the best choice that you're
gonna get
for mayor of new york city in a in in a
world of very bad choices
but this is the type of move this guy
still has pretensions
for much broader leadership even though
he's like a charisma-free beanstalk
and this needs to be used
to seriously tarnish his brand
and i think there's also a story that
you could connect with his approach to
real estate
that will overlap with amazon his
approach to real estate and
housing affordability in crisis in new
york has just been
we'll just build massive high-rises
and stick a few quote-unquote affordable
units in there most of which are
definitely not
affordable for working or poor people so
like a closet
too and like a closet really obviously
spaces no doubt
so i think this model of sort of like
i mean look sort of like corporate
big government liberalism is like yoga
that's bad for you
it's the worst of all worlds and he
needs to be
tarnished with that brand as we
say you know there might have been a
time in 2013 where a dude saying
inequality matters and i supported the
sandinistas in the 80s
that was actually bold and distinct on
the national landscape
not anymore and not only has he not kept
up with it and upgraded with it
he along with andrew cuomo is pimping
for this amazon deal
and that should uh never
sort of that should be front and center
for any conversation we have on bill de
blasio
now i'm about to welcome to the show in
a minute somebody i like a lot more than
bill de blasio
significantly more than bill de blasio
uh malaika jabali
who is a writer attorney and activist
she has a piece for current affairs
which we're going to throw up on screen
in a minute called the color of economic
anxiety i think
an extension out of the conversation
with bill fletcher jr this
uh conversation will really get us where
we need to go in terms of that
conversation and put some sort of
stagnant thinking to sleep so we're
going to take a brief break
and we will be right back with malika
jabali on the michael brooks show

so
[Music]
welcome back to the michael brooks show
joining us now is
malaika jabali she joins us in studio
she is
a writer attorney and activist her piece
which gonna throw up on screen for a
second is called the color of economic
anxiety she wrote it for
nathan robinson's blog current affairs
or current affairs excuse me leica
thanks for being here thanks for having
me
is that good ratio-wise sound-wise guys
just a little bit closer go for it again
thanks for having me perfect so you went
to milwaukee for this piece can you
remind or tell everybody why
what happens in milwaukee a lot of
things are happening in milwaukee
and unfortunately most of the media
hasn't reported it a lot of the
mainstream media hasn't been there and
covered
the economic devastation that is
occurring and that has been
occurring for black milwaukeeans for
about 40 years now
primarily de-industrialization and when
we think about de-industrialization
and the working-class and the midwest
particularly
in blue-collar voters we tend to think
of white people
and i wanted to write this piece to push
back on that narrative
not only because it is fair and just
because we need to talk about those
who are most economically devastated but
because it's the smart thing to do for
talking about
elections and in 2016 while the
pervasive narrative was that white
working class voters or white
conservative leaning voters flipped a
lot of those states to trump
because for instance and was in
wisconsin it went red for the first time
in about 30 years for a president
however when you look at the data you
realize that it's really a story
of non-voters 2016 was a story of
non-voters and i wanted to go down there
and find out why
and it really surprised me the extent
of the economic upheaval that black
people have been facing down there for
decades so we're going to get to the how
the historical origins are in a second
but that reminded me i mean there was
that new york times piece
that came out within i think like a week
of 2016.
and i talked about it on majority report
because it seemed just like
like this is the lane to go like because
even if you're talking
about any voter that didn't show up
or any voter that felt so betrayed by
democratic politics
because of trade agreements because of
attacks on
government spending because of not
campaigning in your state
that instead of like this flip of like
disentangling
why somebody would vote for trump which
i think now
at least in my opinion i mean i don't
know most people voted for trump are
republicans
and republicans vote republican this
isn't really that complicated right
absolutely
but why did the turnout depress itself
and if you look at that interview
if i recall correctly you had a lot of
people saying essentially
some combination of you know
which i think people shouldn't ignore
which is like obama's
a compelling person so i might go out
and vote for obama as a guy
but legislatively not much was happening
for me
hillary didn't really say anything
different than obama and she's not that
compelling
so i'm not going out and i think what
you did in the piece definitely knows
you went to this
much broader history behind it so can
you talk like first of all
just bluntly i think when people think
of wisconsin they don't think of a
particularly black
place they think of a highly white place
but it is in fact
a very african-american very black place
how did that happen what is the great
migration when did people start leaving
the south to go there
and what kind of economy did that create
uh so
that history is very compelling i just
want to add on to what you're
saying with trump because that is a key
reason why i wanted to write this piece
because when you look at
the voter data the folks who voted for
trump was about the same ratios those
who voted for mitt romney
and george bush and john mccain and
literally every other republican
president since
nixon so i talk about that in the piece
as well because that to me is not really
much of a story
if you are a party that serves white
interests
the majority of white people tend to
vote that in that direction so what's
new
and so that's why milwaukee in wisconsin
was so compelling to me because this
said something different and
part of what was so different about it
is thinking of the idea of the black
voter and thinking that they are a
monolith so what we saw
in the hillary campaign and i think the
general
narrative around black voters is that
you know we are in the south this is
this
the democratic firewall and you get
through them through some of these
cultural appeals
bill clinton as we know used quite a bit
of that when he was running
in his earlier campaigns so that's what
we think about typically when you think
about the black voter so it's like it's
like i'm ready to go to church
right you go to church you talk about
beyonce talk about jay-z which is
precisely what hillary clinton did
and if you talk to some black
milwaukeeans like they saw right through
that
and they felt that it was so patronizing
and they were insulted by it
so what the piece initially started off
with me wanting to
think about the midwest more broadly and
it was to
discuss the commemoration of the 50th
anniversary
well the 50th anniversary of the 1967
uprising so there was a lot of civil
unrest
under very similar social milwaukee and
in milwaukee and throughout the country
in a lot of cities where black people
had migrated because they didn't see any
of those civil rights gains that
they had been promised so in 67 in in
watts in california
in newark in detroit and milwaukee all
over the place you saw these uprisings
a lot of civil unrest and there was
arson
there was i mean just everything that
you envision when you think about you
know what a riot or rebellion would look
like
in an urban environment so i went to
milwaukee and detroit
so the piece was really going to be
about detroit but i was like everyone
talks about detroit so let's see what's
going on in milwaukee and that uncovered
so much for me so just pushing back
again on this narrative that black
people are a monolith in the midwest
there
is such a rich tradition of
anti-establishment black politics
there is a rich tradition of progressive
politics
of collective bargaining a lot of the
things that we think about when we think
of progressive politics
was actually born in wisconsin and black
people adopted that
as well and they were also bringing some
of their own tradition coming from
the deep south where you know they were
escaping jim crow
segregation and this really entrenched
legal system of discrimination and
terrorism
so if you've got this group of people
who are already kind of
anti-establishment because they're
you know uprooting their entire lives
and willing to take big risks
huge risks they don't know people they
don't have a network there for the most
part
they're willing to uproot their lives so
there's already this culture
of being a little bit anti-establishment
and we don't really talk about it enough
so
just one more like bit on the history
with that and then i guess
we could talk about the history of you
know the economic decline yeah
um but first i mean yeah like so but
they're leaving
because there's also the perception and
it's not all wrong you outline this that
actually like in this in the
60s and 70s there the there's there's
the fact that it's not living up to the
promise of civil rights
at all but there's also there is
actually a great job market
right and there is there are actually
industrial jobs and that actually feeds
into
a working black middle class through
blue collar just like the same way that
we think of with white workers in the
industrial midwest
and that also feeds again into this
politics of labor which is another
difference from the south right because
it's like there isn't this labor union
politics in the south because they were
crushed as actually part of that same
apartheid
economic system that people were getting
away from yeah and i think
um a good central figure so i framed the
piece around some
you know folks who represent different
walks of life
different generations but they are
integral to the
kind of cultural and political fabric of
milwaukee and one of those
men is a name as a man by the name
of wendell harris and he was
the like former union president of the
black trade unionist
also a democratic socialist and here's
an older black dude democratic socialist
and has been
for years and i think what's really
interesting
about that is a lot of folks in his
generation came from
arkansas so they were familiar with bill
clinton so there was
also like this anti-like clinton
anti-new democratic
like tradition that was going on at the
same time because he saw what was going
on in arkansas
under bill clinton's governorship he saw
what the corporate tax breaks were doing
he saw what the union busting was doing
in arkansas i was like oh no
i'm not about that here and so that
collective bargaining
was a big part of uh what black men
experienced
in the midwest black men occupied about
54 or 54 of the black male population at
the time in this in 1970
were in manufacturing jobs versus 21 of
white men in milwaukee so the vast
majority the majority of black men
relied on you know the manufacturing
industry to make a living
where you know white folks had more
options you know
the the market was a little bit more uh
diverse for them
so when you take that away from them
then you see a lot of the trends that
you know that are occurring right now in
terms of the economic impacts
yeah and you quoted some incredible
statistics like
at the heart of of this sort of like
industrial economy
black male employment in wisconsin is
higher than the national average of
employment for everybody
yes and then it sinks just like
catastrophically low
yeah the black male jobless rate is
about 50
in milwaukee and it's uh retained it's
been at that rate for about
10 years so since the great recession
basically
i want to like compare actually bill and
hillary clinton i think internally
because it helps your piece
i think and and sort of like
understanding this conversation at least
for me because
my understanding of bill clinton was
sort of like
he was doing basically three things he
was which is that's a super bill clinton
way of formulating right
i was doing three things so number one
was that a bill clinton accent i heard
bit okay a little bit if i have a few
more beers in me i'll get you
i'm ready we'll do an snl thing i'll do
the whole post game as bill clinton
okay don't worry about it so move the
democratic party to the right
get corporate campaign contributions and
this is like coming out of the 80s and
and actually even carter right like
they're already
deregulating airline and busing
industries and he's part of the
democratic leadership council which gets
all this corporate money to back trade
agreements and
deregulate finance and blah blah then on
the other hand
he is actually moving um in some ways
paradoxically more so
than at least in 92 he actually did talk
about things like universal health care
so there was a little bit of like a
populist thing
but the other part of the populist thing
was
like the types of racialized politics
that would shock the type of woke people
you see on twitter who stand for the
clintons all the time
right like the same people who you know
bernie sanders is like yeah you know i
i used the wrong pronoun they would be
like yeah bernie's cancelled
these people like bill clinton made his
business
to go home to execute a mentally
disabled black man when he was running
for president
to talk about welfare i know you're
going to go off on this in a second i'm
going to try not to
i don't want to go off you have
absolutely no you can do whatever you
feel
and then at the same time there was this
other
and also to me i think even like 20
years later as we're adults
reads like super patronizing like bill
clinton's the first black president bill
clinton you know he plays the saxophone
and he's cool and all of this
and then you fast forward to hillary
clinton and you actually have
essentially the same sort of like
political profile
but the social signaling flips so we go
from like
i'll tell you what like here i'll do a
full one black people need
to work and i should you know and i'll
play the sax for you but you need to be
a father
and then hillary clinton's like it's
called intersectionality
and then meanwhile like you know here's
beyonce here's intersectionality yeah
some hot sauce
no jobs go yourself yeah
and in both of those things is what is
concealing the economics and concealing
structural racism and in both of those
strategies this type of
midwest populist african-american
politics is completely negated
is that how you frame it absolutely and
that framing is essentially i believe
what i argue is that it cost her the
election
so the black vote in milwaukee
or i should say wisconsin generally went
from about
they lost 88 000 black voters i'll just
put it there how much is that as voter
suppression just to like be fair to put
that in the mix
it's hard to tell and i think um i mean
my argument is that at least in 2016 in
wisconsin there is not
there's more evidence saying that it was
voter disinterest over voter suppression
i think voter suppression you know just
to back up is obviously
a key issue right now it's critical that
we
get a hold of that and that we hold
both democrats and republicans
accountable for that i'm from georgia
so i see what's happening right now with
stacey abrams
that kind of suppression has been
happening in the south for decades
literally the first election that i was
able to vote in
there was a an intense amount of voter
suppression
um it was between centum i don't know if
this is kind of back in the day i'm
probably a little bit older than people
may think
at least i'd like to think i am and we
had a congresswoman named cynthia
mckinney who was running
she was like saying you know george matt
has a crush on cynthia mckinney
i worry i'm not sure if you're familiar
you know what she looked like no he she
does
um so i know what she looks like because
of matt okay
yeah he's her pictures are all around
here guys y'all just can't see it
matt has the shrines of tupac and
cynthia mckinney it's very interesting
i'm sorry to put your business
up like that all right go ahead and so
she was my congresswoman and we saw how
republicans basically ousted her because
she was the one you know questioning
i think they might have talked about her
and michael in 9 11. i don't remember
but anyway
we saw this happening she was a little
extra at times i mean
but she was a good guy people who are
going to push back so she pushed back
she was asking about you know what
happened with 9 11. we need to ask
questions basically and so
because we have open you know primaries
in georgia
they republicans found a way to kick her
out and they would place her with
somebody somebody denise mcgregor that's
right
yeah she was there for like two one term
and then
hasn't been heard of since so it's
clearly there to
to basically get cynthia mckinney out
they needed somebody more interest
got it so anyway voter suppression is
key um and i think we need to
also be aware of when we are oppressing
people who are poor who are working
class
in and out of elections so not just in
an election cycle should we be
worried about people who are under
oppressive conditions we need to speak
to those issues
and unfortunately a lot of times
democrats don't do that i should say
mainstream democrats
don't and that's not what happened in
wisconsin hillary clinton didn't step
foot in wisconsin most people will tell
you that
after she became a nominee she did not
speak to the 50
black male unemployment there was an
uprising there in 2016 in august just a
few months
before the general election talk about
that we'll lead to that
you describe this really well in the
piece as well so in a neighborhood
called sherman park
there was a group of folks who
were fed up and the reasons for that are
myriad the
um the match point was the killing of
a young man named sybil smith he was
killed by a police officer
like cold blood there are videos that
circulated
and just in a few hours the city was in
flames
so i spoke with alderman khalif rainey
who was there
it was his district where he saw this
happening he said it was
the most chilling thing he's ever
experienced in his life
because it was just anarchy he didn't
know you know what
his neighborhood was going to look like
the next day because he he grew up
in a neighboring district and now this
was his district and to see it go down
when
especially historically it was there for
like kind of black middle class like
that was the the
sherman park was an area that you
aspired to live in one day
and to see it decimated he was
he was baffled and he also felt
completely powerless and imagine you
just
you know you just gotten elected this is
your district
and you have absolutely no control over
this because
these things have been building up for
decades if you imagine you know
from one literally just one hour to the
next something is completely
in flames what else is going on there so
if you are an elected official you think
you would at least
ask why and to be an elected official of
a state that you
need to win and you don't even step foot
in that state it speaks to i think for a
lot of people a lack of
you know just no sense of of
like i guess understanding or or no
sense of reality about
the real conditions people are
experiencing right right
right i mean it kind of reminds me i
know i'm always going to do brazil
examples but this actually is
appropriate because i
i talked with a friend once about
basically when they
when they impeached dilma rousseff right
who's the successor to lula who i'm
always talking about on this show
because i consider him to be a political
prisoner
and i said but do you think like if lula
was president even with all the
corruption all of these people gunning
at the workers party would he have
managed to survive and he's like yeah he
really probably would have and part of
it was
he showed me this clip of this interview
where lula like in the heart of this
crisis with all this austerity happening
was like
the first thing we've got to do is to
get credit
and investment circulating back into
like people's hands like all this other
stuff is
noise compared to like getting the money
now
and if you follow that instinct people
will come to you
so like you have all of these people in
the article who get it
who are organizers who are politicians
who are part of the party who are part
of
even the naacp which is definitely not
in my read in modern politics a radical
force
at all so was it that the clinton
campaign not only didn't campaign there
but it didn't even have like an
any um relationship with any of the
actors on the ground there and if so
like
is that changing at all from my
reporting and speaking to fred royal who
is the president of the naacp milwaukee
chapter he said that her ground game was
atrocious
i followed up with an interview with
angela lang
she is the i think want to say executive
director and president
of an organization called block black
leaders organizing for communities
she also spoke to the lack of real
um just substantive organizing in those
communities
and again this is organizing that you're
you're gonna need not just
you know a month before the election but
just having a presence
and it doesn't seem like the democratic
leadership in the state
or in the city really understood that
most of the community organizers of
course like they they see it they see it
every day
and there was less kind of finger
pointing and vilifying people for not
wanting to be engaged and saying
what are the substance of economic
policies that you're going to bring
forward to excite people just again to
shout out
georgia that's something that stacey
abrams has been doing and so
i want to mention her too because i
think that's an excellent contrast
between what's been what's been
happening in 2016 and what can happen
um in the near future if we're looking
at you know
ways to look ahead for progressives and
for for black people and to
resolve some of these economic
insecurities that they're experiencing
she excited people but she didn't just
excite them by saying hey i'm a black
lady vote for me
she was going around these communities
and saying we need a living wage i'm
going to expand medicare
we're going to bring collective
bargaining to georgia which is something
you don't do in georgia it's a right to
work state it's republican controlled
so they were framing her as radical and
she was deliberately positioning herself
against
a white democratic candidate who she
easily could have kind of
pandered to the center because she's
already black so that's radical and
just being a black woman natural hair
that's radical enough but she didn't
back down
and despite having you know a more
centrist white candidate she
she blew her away in the primaries so
i think that is like a good next step to
have
and you know there is this kind of
contrast with what's happening on in
democratic national leadership
i think the the mainstream you know
um machinery versus what's happening
with people who identify as democrats
but they're they kind of operate
independently from
whatever their platform might be yeah
definitely i mean
to what extent like i've gotten really
annoyed with this
class verse identity debate because i
just think it's
i just think it's stupid and i don't
think it really answers anything right
yeah
so my and my only concern right now
is i feel like and i want to run this by
use i feel like okay
there's no doubt that following the
clinton campaign
that there's people whether they're
mediocre mainstream pundits or whether
they're over
compensated mediocre democratic
consultants
and whether it's because they're you
know running campaigns that rely on
corporate money or they're just
insulated media professionals that have
no connection to real life
they're very happy to run this scenario
out which is like
it's all a limited set of identity
issues and discussing
um economics and classes you know a
distraction
or you're really just like you know of i
don't know bernie bro or whatever
on the other hand which i have been
called by the way i'm sure you are
[Laughter]
like okay you guys calm down anyway
that's why i had you on the show
i only have bernie bro yeah yes it's
reunion
yeah yeah we only have yeah we were i
remember
when i shouldn't say this but we met
during we were
participating in a targeted harassment
campaign on twitter together
yeah yeah
yeah i remember that very clearly yeah
malika was uh she was she was sending uh
screenshots of malcolm x to amanda
marcotte and it was very triggering
yeah but um no one love but
but then on the other hand i think there
are some people that have taken
on the flip side they've sort of skipped
what your reporting illustrates which is
regardless of political strategy
what this country needs is social
democracy period
and basically 99 need it but in fact
disproportionately people of color need
it
and there's no contradiction between
that and dealing with
policing and any and anything to do with
justice and emancipation
and i think that some people by getting
so fixated
on this like mythical trump voter that
is more like in their heads than in
reality like they're like oh
we're gonna go and we're gonna talk to
some trump voter who has like a swat
sticker and then we're gonna say
but what about free college and then all
of a sudden they're gonna like put on
pete seeger music and hug us and it's
like
that's not what's happening most trump
voters are absolutely motivated by race
xenophobia
gender and they are doing white identity
politics because that's the republican
party
and somehow i just like can we just like
cut a lane
where it's like don't worry about all
these
you know democrat technocratic people
who are going to use identity politics
to undermine progress
or knock off cal door identity politics
but then on the other hand don't fall
into the trap
of romanticizing this trump voter or
arguing against identity politics in a
way that toxifies our brand as leftists
you know that's what worries me yeah i
have i have nothing to
that i need to add but i will add to it
that's perfect
no that's literally kind of been my
stance i get it
all of us are suffering under capitalism
there's no doubt about it
we have tried to by we i mean just the
general you know i consider myself
radical the radicals and
the leftists i've been trying to get
bernie bros have been trying to convince
you know racist white people that for
centuries probably
and i think a lot of them like being
racist i think they
they enjoy the sense of power that it
gives them to to feel that they've got
you know some uh some sort of hold over
another demographic that's just how
their minds work at the same time again
because capitalism
does involve all of us and it implicates
everyone
how do we navigate that and i think that
is a little bit tricky but
we've got more than enough black people
who are suffering more than enough
non-racist white people who voted for
obama
like legit voted for obama who probably
you know
just stuck out this last election
because they didn't want either trump or
hillary clinton
we've got enough you know latino voters
we've got more than enough people
who are oppressed economically and
socially
that we can be targeting so you know i
actually did some campaigning speaking
of bernie i did some campaigning
and this was when this was in 2016 when
we were trying to get bernie to win
michigan
i am an activist so i'm like a
non-traditional
i wouldn't say i'm really a journalist
per say i'm a writer because like my
my whole goal is to be involved with
communities and to do activism
it's like me i'm like i'm really a talk
show host
bernie bro yeah theme of the night guys
we're all right
um and we were just don't act like that
isn't going to get another call back
all right but keep going so i was
talking to a voter
who was voted for obama and so it does
exist
it's a thing and she was contemplating
between
waffling between bernie sanders and
donald trump and so i had to
you know give her my spiel and she was
like okay bernie sanders has my vote
so that those people exist they're you
know
they're they are swimming voters that is
a thing
but i think democrats they tend to just
historically speaking at least for the
last maybe
40 or 50 years they tend to think of
identity as mutually exclusive from
economic appeals so when they are trying
to find their identity
after robert kennedy's assassination
they swung all the way to
just kind of identity exclusively when
they realized okay we lost the white
vote to richard nixon there's nothing we
can do to get them back
we don't need to really talk about
economics or economic justice or
anything that could really appeal to
them
and that that framing is completely
backwards you know you've got these
pendulum switch shifts where or swings
where you're going kind of between these
white economic voters or
or relying on this economic justice
platform for them
or you're excluding black people or
you're talking about black people and
not really including people of all races
who are dealing with economic
injustice so that is a key
uh that's going to be debilitating for
democrats for
the immediate future if they don't get a
hold of that particularly on a national
level and they don't hold you know hold
on to that conversation
um hold on to that narrative the way
that donald trump has successfully done
so i think they need to look at people
you know like alexandria ocasio-cortez
look at her win
and stacy abrams win as some models
because it can happen you know other
than brian kemp being an and
definitely stealing the election yeah we
got we're gonna actually have
in the post game a guy who is an
organizer for vote georgia is going to
call in with an update
on that we're going to do some more
talking about that but
just another follow so i i think that
that's absolutely true
and i think there's no like
again people need to get really real
about
the data that's accumulating about the
trump voter profile
out of this election and again in some
ways as we keep saying it's
they're republicans it's not really that
sophisticated but
you know whatever but i do think in the
long term
it's very dangerous that democrats
created a brand where they associated
racial and gender progress
with trash economics i think that's
really dangerous and if those two things
because i
because i do think that what some of
this sort of resurgence
of like alt-right things i think that
some of what's happening is that
some of these like say very specifically
like say middle class white guys are
recognizing that actually in today's
global economy the way the economy is
structured
you can't actually just get a free ride
as a middle class white guy anymore
you can't it's just not the way it's
structured and so
instead of going to socialism they're
going to like well what was the time
where that was guaranteed and
that's an interest in things like
apartheid politics in my opinion because
that
is when you had capitalism that was
structured
so it was just completely racially
insulated right so i think like
in the long term not election cycle by
election cycle but over the span of
decades
if in people's minds they're always like
well the party that is
right on you know even just like gay
rights marriage equality is also the one
that's saying like
 you like you don't code
you're useless that
toxifies progress in people's minds in a
way
and i do think that's a longer term
problem yeah i mean
i i think it's also kind of an immediate
problem in the sense that there are a
lot of black voters who are already
disillusioned
oh well definitely i'm talking about the
white people okay so there's no yeah
yeah white well just
white people take that's why i said long
term yeah a little bit longer
yeah i mean i was kind of thinking about
that too i was walking around
on my lunch break just randomly thinking
about the future of capitalism in
america
and and it's just it's a steady decline
right and we've been experiencing it
first you know how they say if when
america catches a cold black people get
the flu
so there are there's evidence of this
already amongst us and these are people
who are
you know staunchly democrats so if you
can lose these people imagine what
happens
with you know the the general you know
electoral body
when you start seeing the ways that i
mean we're just
you guys were talking about it like new
york city is getting more and more empty
we've got long island city that's going
to be overrun by these tech bros
i love some of my tech bros i dated the
tech pro like i get it
like like a tech bro who i also think
was a little bit libertarian
was it a libertarian i kind of i'm sorry
ladies and gentlemen the interview's
over
i kind of i'm gonna kindly ask you to
leave i shouldn't be talking about him
because he's great
um i was simply trying to fix the
culture
in many ways you put on your headphones
yeah you just got
you just got owned by a sound drop you
gotta you gotta get your headphones on
you missed the james daymond
yeah this is your ex-boyfriend right i
was simply trying to
fix the culture in many ways
james daymore the google guy what google
guy there's so many
he did the google memo that uh he got
him fired for the sexual discrimination
he said girls couldn't do computer
coding he also dated you
he dated you for a while
[Laughter]
he was just trying so long
[Laughter]
should i order caviar so yeah i mean
like manhattan manhattan is just getting
more and more
you know in you know just unlivable for
people
who are even making six figures so where
are people going to go what's going to
happen
and that's across the board so you know
black folks we've been leaving for
decades to reverse migration back to you
know my city of atlanta
and you know throughout the south so
what's going to happen with the rest of
the country
final question before we go to the post
game to what extent to
what i don't think i really liked about
your piece and i'm
i always like so even even is just
talking about like the black
vote as one monolithic thing and i'm not
even saying like i'm not even i'm not
making some pc point
like oh no you can't it's like no
literally like even in new york city
like the political tradition of harlem
is
really different than brooklyn because
there's a difference if you
came to new york from the south versus
you know
a caribbean community like there's
different politics there's different
incentives there's different
and so many of these conversations not
just because obviously i wanted to push
back and defend bernie
as a bernie bro but it was also like
literally you know you're wrong i mean
we see this there's a breakdown with
like
older black voters prefer clinton
younger black voters
prefer bernie you point out
the south with a certain social
conservatism which reflects
actually in fact all southern voters and
that's also changing we see that with
stacey abrams and andrew gillum
uh and then this like midwest populist
black labor tradition
so to what extent we also just need to
like of course
there's a black vote and there's overall
black interests and black
threats certainly from something like
the trump administration but it seems
like
people need to start figuring out how to
disaggregate like
voters inside the black community
right having very different interests
different ideological traditions
different politics
is that going to help us get where we
need to go and
also campaigns not be morons and
go to wisconsin
yeah and i think it'll help you know uh
mainstream democrats even though
i'm not chilling for them i don't really
care if they improve because we need to
get them out so they can keep losing if
they like to if they want to treat
black people as a monolith keep losing
that's cool right
and i think it's important for people
who identify as leftists as well so when
you think of working class
you know this piece is to push back on
the narrative that it is
you know exclusively white that it
erases black people
who do have a tradition of like you know
we talked about before collective
bargaining
where they come from you know
kind of this anti-establishment politics
if you want to win
then yes you're going to need to target
these voters
and not because you know you just want
their vote but because
they're suffering a lot of these folks
have been dealing with capitalism
de-industrialization i framed the piece
around a factory called ao smith
which is like the prime example of what
happens when there
is outsourcing and this race to the
bottom
in you know corporate governance so they
move their operations to mexico they
move their operations to china
there are no more jobs left the jobs
that did remain
in milwaukee they moved to the suburbs
so
if you are not recognizing
a that you know so many black people are
in these manufacturing industries
then you're also not recognizing the the
policy issues that you're going to need
to address like mass transit
how do you get people from the center
city
to suburbs free universal mass transit
yes that needs to be censored how do you
have mass transit in these neighborhoods
if you're
or i mean how do you even address the
the things that
are within your purview if you don't
even realize that it's an issue
to begin with so that
is joy reid was talking about this the
other day of course she was right yeah
yeah
i love how the hate for joy reid is so
heavy that people don't even do like the
pause like really she was talking about
that it's always like
yeah of course she was okay yeah i think
i re-followed her
because of like one thing that i wanted
to look at i was like okay i'm i'm done
i never i i think relative to most
bernie bros i have been so easy on
joyride
it's amazing people really don't like
you i read
i mean she's trash don't get me wrong
i'm just i'm just like
it's msnbc what was that emma what was
that bernie sanders thing she did about
him being like a college
he's a bad roommate he's a bad roommate
which i mean i don't know
hey can i borrow your bit torrent
i swear i wasn't downloading where i was
we have a strike notice from verizon was
it me
i'm tired of being blamed i think i'm
the only one that downloads on this yeah
yeah i'm the only guy because i'm the
only one that's twirling you
all right if joey reed was doing that
that'd be good if joy reeve was doing a
solid bernie impression about him
stealing netflix passwords
i would give her a pass every single day
that's a type of broadcast talent that
goes a long way with me
it's the same reason i like alex jones
all right um
we bettered alex jones dissing ben
shapiro when we bedded ether under it
and it worked
i don't even remember why he dissed ben
shapiro oh because benjamin's whack
he he put out a track on ben shapiro and
we
bettered ether under it and it worked it
like it actually flowed
that at ether i think this is like next
level bernie bro i'm not like all the
way there
what is this i'm curious so ether
you know the uh nas is yes jay-z tracks
yeah we played
in studio audience yeah you don't need
to create a video just yeah you can play
it on audio
we did this i mean so yeah i don't have
the ether on it though oh you don't have
the ether on it
oh you said you embedded we put the
ether we bedded the ether instrumental
under it's just we just put we just
played
jesus christ terminology
it's it's bernie bro inner sanctum
terminology
we we just played the ether instrumental
while do you have this scary and
powerful
see it works a bunch of libertarian
conservative
thought and a bunch of other things okay
yeah exactly all right we're gonna go to
the post game
[Laughter]
where there will be a lot more of that
type of thing are we freestyling today

spoken word about cynthia mckinney

last thing i will join your diss track

it would be very good for you too yeah
you'd like to do that you will we will
yeah let me just say this no never mind
i respect the hell out of joy reid's
game
like that she was just like yup russians
wrote that
she just stood by it how could you not
respect that
that is we we do need more of that we
need a lot more of that
she's just like yup that's right because
the russians they went back to florida
russia's hacked the way bank machine
like the like putin was like
one day she would be important them
assembly see commentators so and then
the
america will have big progress for gays
and then there will be a thing called
twitter where people freak out
every single second but she will be part
of the people that freak out for every
single second
well under hypocrisy with uh yes by your
own logic and then she's just like yeah
