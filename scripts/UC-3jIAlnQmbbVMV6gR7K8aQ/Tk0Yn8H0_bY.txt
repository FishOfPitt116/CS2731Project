so sarah when we broke uh you had not
only explained to us um
the i guess the uh the ideas behind the
holocaust and humanity senator
that is in uh in museum center in
cincinnati
um but also this concept that um
you explore at the uh museum of
upstanding versus bystanding in terms of
a
a disposition uh that we
as citizens and members of a society
should have um even in instances that
are not
necessarily their dramatic or
uh inflection points uh but rather
um almost everyday situations where
doing even a little begins to set up a
dynamic where in the event that we are
in inflection points uh where we are
involved in a situation that's more
dynamic
we've developed some i guess reservoir
if you will
and uh some sense of like immunity um
to or inoculation to uh you know
bad trends that can take place and you
know we had mentioned the
uh major protest that took place in the
announcement of the a muslim ban that
doesn't come out of anywhere that comes
out of like you know sort of
organization and a sense of community
uh and that we need to protect the the
most vulnerable amongst us
um the flip side of that of course is
what is it seems to me um
uh indisputably happening in our country
at this moment
is a rise of
of hate groups and emboldening an
emboldenment
of people who harbor um
racist anti-semitic uh uh
misogynist uh antis uh
you know islamophobic uh sentiments uh
that
seems to be um you know
you know inarguable and i wonder how you
reconcile these two things
it's very difficult let me let me first
uh say that that um
what we're seeing um nationally
um in the rise in hate crimes
bias crimes um speech what we you know
anecdotally here in schools um is
is very concerning although um
a couple of things about it one um while
i think
we're seeing much more of it right now i
don't know that the sentiments
in particular racist anti-semitic
any of these um
hate um and isms that we're seeing
really really surface in a strong way
i don't think they're new um i think um
what we're seeing
to you what you said in the in the intro
is you know an emboldening
or a feeling that it's it's okay to talk
about at the moment or to take action on
um but actually the biggest thing that
concerns me
at this moment is how much hate there
has been
i don't think it's it's new i think it's
been there and i think it's been
sort of under the surface and um i think
we're at a very pivotal moment to say
what is going to happen um and
while you know the southern poverty law
center just came out with their 2018
report that indicated again um
for the past couple of years that hate
groups are on the rise
um and in particular you know where i'm
located in the
in the us in ohio and kentucky there
were specifically rises that were
mentioned
in that in that report um
certainly is is concerning um at the
same time
you know we are seeing um an enormous
amount
of response in particular to our museum
opening and conversations going on about
how do we address this and how how do
schools handle it how do communities
handle it
um how do families that have on that
level even
have conversations that um work to
counter
um what we're seeing as a trend uh which
is really troubling
so i mean if it's your perspective that
um
we're not seeing a any there's not a
development of
new let's say hate and it's you know
very difficult obviously
to to quantify this but there's not new
hate there's just
um hate feeling like it can come out of
the closet
do you how like is there
i mean does is that the way it always is
in you from your perspective i mean
you've studied this obviously you've
studied it from a you know
a historic perspective uh you know when
you're um
yeah you know programming this th this
type of
museum i mean are are we looking at a
a baseline that is static throughout
time and there are just
some times where it expresses
itself it feels more comfortable
expressing itself or is there a
diminishment over time
or are there times where there there can
be growth
so i think there a little bit of
everything um i think that we do see
waves and time periods where
you know if we look back at american
history or
um um history in general where we see
um times depending on whatever um
whatever hap is happening in in those
days where
hate rises and then subsides um you know
there are many people
in my work who really talk about it
being kind of a
pattern and uh and you know human nature
that there are these cycles um i am a
bit more of
an optimist actually that um
that there are these cycles and what's
happening right now is is
very alarming but that we're still
moving
in a trend towards um
more acceptance and more inclusion and i
actually think
the back some of the backlash we're
seeing is because
there has been some progress does there
need to be
more and is it concerning that now these
hate groups and there's
there's a serious amount of violence to
worry about absolutely but i think in
part
that is um in response to some of
some of the positive things that have
happened and and also that
um many you know i can i can say in in
our community in other places
you know many community leaders are
speaking out against hate and business
leaders and others
um and so i think the more we can
actually not that we can't that we have
to we can't ignore
um the reality of hate groups and hate
that exists we have to
stay laser focused on it at the same
time we have to give a lot of attention
to those who are speaking out against it
especially leaders
um to um you know initiatives that i
know
are created locally globally nationally
um to address this and and really um
use this moment as an opportunity for um
for education for learning um and for
hopefully um taking this wave and and
changing its course
you know i mean i guess um i mean i i
the
there is a sense that there is an
institutional and
sort of societal ballast that um
will uh contain these things but i also
imagine
uh there are moments in history where
people have thought that
uh was the case so vigilance is in order
uh sarah weiss executive director for
the holocaust and humanity center
thank you so much i really appreciate
your time today
