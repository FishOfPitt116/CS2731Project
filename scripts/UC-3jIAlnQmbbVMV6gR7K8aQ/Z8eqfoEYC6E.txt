hey folks
look i um
i am reluctant
to uh promote violence of any type
which is why it gives me such great
pleasure to promote
this video of um
kargarn of sargon
oh but don't we have one of sargon well
we can uh we don't have oh
okay we're going to actually get in here
with them okay well we have two we have
one image
and one uh video clip uh
one is of nigel farage
milk shaked and one is a picture of
sargon of arcade getting milkshake and
here's the thing
well here's the picture of sagan of
akkad
wearing the arcadian milkshake um
covering the traditional uh milkshaking
uh uh covering he's been anointed he's
been anointed
um he is uh he's wearing that milkshake
with pride
somebody got him it appears from behind
because you can see the milkshake
pattern sort of the back of his head
and it makes him look a little more
distinguished in some respects
when i see him i usually think carl is
swindon
when i think of this i do in some ways i
see a sort of a cod
emerging from the battlefield of ideas
yes indeed
now here is a video of nigel farage
getting a milkshake and uh let me
address both of the milk shakians
at the same time
oh there you go take him away
take him away boom
nice nice underhanded motion
very good take him away take him away
send him no more fischer filets for him
no more
this is why i think this is so
appropriate this is why i think it's so
such an appropriate form of protest and
some people say oh it's
not appropriate i think this is there
couldn't be anything more appropriate
than this and i'll tell you why
i had uh i've been milkshaked
multiple times over the course of doing
this show by my kids
nobody reports on it i i've
had clothes ruined just like this take
them away
i've been ice creamed uh i've been uh
i've been pizzaed
i don't know if anybody's ever been
pizza before where where
uh your child will take a slice of pizza
and just accidentally drop it on your
lap or on your
chest nobody reported on it because
these things happen it's not that big of
a deal
the reason why these are reported on and
why there's stories about these
is because it is a political act it is
symbolic
no no people were harmed these
milkshakes are not sentient
and the people on the receiving end of
them the only problem is it just didn't
go in their mouth and ended up going on
their clothes
milkshakes are delightful everybody
loves them most people like them to
drink them as opposed to wear them
but the point is it is a it's a
political act it is meant to make them
like a pie in the face it's meant
to make them humiliated and look silly
and i think this is incredibly effective
the people laughing at them and it's
also meant to make them like
uh aware that like you can't
you're accountable in some fashion this
is just a milkshake but you're
accountable
and um i i
i couldn't be more happy even if
somebody was come up and milkshake me
guess what
papers would report on it
none yes exactly we would make a video
ourselves
no we would make a video a fascist uh
milkshake sam
yeah i mean i would do a selfie and i'll
make a video of it but
these stories are reported in newspapers
and they should be and that and that
shows
the effectiveness of it this is the
content and form thing again like
somebody was
somebody in the uk was saying well what
if one of your favorite politicians got
milkshakes like if corbin got milkshake
he'd
generally get sympathy right i mean if
corbin got milkshakes
and you were like the the the story
would be
well i don't know what the story would
be but i can guess it would
it would help be helpful to him the far
right doesn't do
milkshakes though they usually just do
violence right
but it would be um it would be
it would be nice to see those guys in
charlottesville to go out and
actually just like here are milkshakes
here are
milkshakes we're going to milk shake
juice
jews should drink milkshakes don't mind
if i do
oh we got to play this clip speaking of
which
um i don't know why this occurs to me
but
uh there's a video there's a movie
coming out
about the about censor censorship
and no it's not about um uh political
prisoners in china
uh it's no no it's not about um uh
political prisoners you know maybe from
uh like you know
bolsonaro or something like that it's
not about um
you know protesters in this country
who've been you know kettled and
and uh or people who are uh arrested
before like a
political convention taken off the
streets no
it's about alex jones and laura loomer
and
um gavin mcginnis and then two other uh
i would imagine right wingers uh and how
they've been censored they have no
they've been completely censored except
for of course this movie yeah how they
distributed
and uh there's a great uh
clip of gavin sort of um driving and
talking about the hardship that he's
been going through
um in his uh his
his um wealthy suburb we'll play it
tomorrow
but there's also a vic burger version
which is really
which is even better you forever
that's my common quote i say
it's you forever we're done
