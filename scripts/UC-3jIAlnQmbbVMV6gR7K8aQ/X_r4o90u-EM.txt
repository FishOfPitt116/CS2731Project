[Music]
oh let's play the um this is also fun
hey you remember this guy tommy robinson
he's come up occasionally uh
on the conte in the context of this
program uh this is a guy who is
um a uh right-wing nationalist would you
say
he's been affiliated with ukip and i
think but i think also bnp british
national party which has a
direct brown shirt uh black shirt
history yeah and he's he's primarily uh
anti-muslim activist primarily
he's also somebody who left dave in
recovery mode from taking on so many
important headlines yeah he features in
the timbo toast video and he
is so um so adept that he for an entire
hour uh spoke to dave rubin of all
people and if you can get through the
gauntlet of talking to dave rubin
without hanging yourself without hanging
yourself oh my gosh
uh enough so that sam harris was
convinced pretty good guy
everything he says but apparently um
this kid um
i think we need to name don yall maybe
uh this is in warrington cheshire
um i don't know if his name is danielle
uh
but uh he was campaigning there and um
guy came up to talk to uh to tommy
robinson and
whoops milkshakes
[Music]
that's what you get for being a fascist

[Applause]
yeah the guy say tommy it's not
worth it yeah
yeah tell me it's not worth it oh my god
every time you throw food on a fascist
an angel gets its wings
milkshake is pretty good it's so great
he's doing he's like he's like you're
not gonna do nothing you're not gonna
oh who's quoted as saying like a
milkshake won't stop this campaign
very funny thing they have to put in the
newspaper yeah
gotta appreciate that apparently that's
the second time he's gotten milkshakes
yeah i couldn't find the
the second one uh the earlier one i
think this was the second time but
uh it's a milkshakes or eggs i think
either
are uh interesting tactics so diversity
of tactics we need
that's right indeed food products keep
it simple
cute um
