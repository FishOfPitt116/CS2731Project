oh yes all right
thank goodness ladies and gentlemen we
have
uh things like exodus that of course is
the
um the movement to have jews leave the
democratic party
led by a millennial um
former trump campaign staffer who has
explained to us
it's like exodus but for jews
and we uh jews as we
exodus what is to con to continue the
of the metaphor what is our
promised land who is there waiting for
us
in the promised land we are all headed
into the desert as part of our exodus
and we are going to be uh on the outside
of of judea and
uh where who will be there waiting for
us at the promised land why
it's the republican party with folks
like
former governor lapaj paul
page of maine who explains why we should
all come running into
his hands in
what is ostensibly a critique
of the anti-semitism in the democratic
party
paul appogged can't help himself
great to have you on and we appreciate
you making time for us this morning
well my pleasure i can tell you guys
right off the bat i feel completely
vindicated from
anything i've ever said in my life now
that we have omar
in this country so go ahead and expound
on that why don't you begin with so you
have of course the anticipation
he's jumping right in by saying omar in
this country
country yeah justifies anything he's
said yeah
everything is also going to say you've
said a lot
he said quite a bit but let's just hear
his reasoning uh because
uh paula page so supportive of the jews
go ahead and expound on that why don't
you begin with so you have of course the
anti-semitism from representative omar
unbelievable i if i'll tell you
the jewish people in america have been
great supporters of the democratic party
in fact that's where their money comes
from for the most part
[Laughter]
it is literally an ellie valley drawing
let me just come right out of the gate
by saying it's super offensive because
you think about these
these friggin bird beaks have been
shoveling these ungrateful bastards
they're gold for so long
and you think about it it's really
ungrateful to not
do something for that he's done
for you
i feel vindicated everything i've ever
said in my life right now they
have completely bought our politics they
own them
they bought them and yet this is the
kind of treatment they get
i mean i feel as if i go to a restaurant
for a service
and i pay for a lunch well these guys
own the whole goddamn establishment you
still got this girl
that shouldn't even be in the country to
begin with
and she gets to disrespect them well i
feel vindicated in everything i've ever
said
they own the media and then people in
the media criticize them
it's unbelievable that was a beautiful
pivot
now to be fair to be fair we should say
and and i want to be absolutely clear on
this
um that uh governor lepage said nothing
about jews drinking the blood of young
christian kids so
i want to get that i want to make it yes
they've put down their chalices
of christian virgin blood and the only
thing they've done is look up to see if
they could
build a new money lending business or
write a check to the democratic national
committee and this is the thanks they
get
you know i know those people have low
self-esteem because i watched a quarter
of a woody allen movie once
but this is a bit much
totally self-deprecating i think we
should just let them
keep on going because there's no better
advertisement for the fact
that uh plenty of people in this
right-wing zionist coalition are
extremely anti-semitic uh plenty of them
think that jews are going to hell
too they they just have some like really
really wacky believes l.a valley
actually did
a cartoon about this very recently where
uh basically illustrating the fact that
they can say
whatever they want they can they can
accuse us of drinking christian baby
blood as long as they uphold um
the trump of israel hey what's purgatory
for a jew
it means it's it's perpetually a week
before they collect the rent
anyways there's a lot of anti-semitism
in the democratic party
oh my god like wow guys
oh boy
i'm sure megan mccain's excited i'm sure
she's coming sick she called in sex
apparently she had
wow i bet she did she took some time off
i thought she did
she had to call in sick she pulled she
pulled them she pulled the brooks that's
some self-care
megan mondays
at least my dad doesn't work
oh jesus
