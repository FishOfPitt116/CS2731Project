this is
a the uaw chairman telling the story
of a union member's son being denied
cancer treatment this is sound number
eight i mean this just
really underlines that this is not
something you play with
let's watch this i believe this is oh
this is with uh
mike elk of payday report uh did this
interview benefits to the end of the
month
um company decided they were gonna cut
him yesterday before
the union was ready to take over with
our strike fund
and we've had a couple members been sick
they couldn't get treated we got a
member with
a kid has cancer went to get his
treatment
and couldn't get it so
we don't have 10 grand to put down and
get reimbursed for we're on strike so
they cut our benefits are affecting our
families and kids and this isn't a
company that cares about people this
company cares about the dollar
and there's another example right there
they don't care about this kid with
cancer and his treatment they just want
us to pay for it
gm murderers they're murderers they're
at least attempting to kill this child
um and anybody that doesn't support
single
payer universal health care for every
single
human being in this country without any
without any nonsense is complicit
and precisely that yeah and if you want
to even pretend that you're in
solidarity with striking workers
you need to take healthcare off of the
table because if you don't think
companies will
will and do and always have used it to
terrorize people like that man
you are naive at the absolute very best
companies will pay more to keep the
private uh um insurance so they have
the ability to do absolutely
this healthcare is going to be a
skeleton key for a lot of things in this
country and every company knows that
they can't lord over you if you don't
have to depend on their health insurance
they're giving you
it makes me so mad no that no but that's
precisely the point that's another
reason that
that all the rhetoric of like well you
know a lot of businesses are
they they don't want to play those
inefficient costs either it's not an
inefficient cost it's a strategy yeah
look if you're a small business yes of
course it would benefit small businesses
but if you're a major multinational
corporation that's already
uh exploiting and underpaying your
workers to
suck money up to the shareholder class
anyways you have private health care so
you can try to kill children
when your employees go on strike so that
they can get basic wages
that's how power works these questions
that we deal with every day are not
technical questions
they are power questions
and you need to wrap your heads around
that this isn't technocracy folks
it is not technocracy and even things
like yes
you know what oh my god i i do disagree
with bernie
on the filibuster i'm less fixated on it
than others
but i do disagree however
i got news for you the filibuster is not
the thing keeping back this agenda
will be the next thing because there is
a capital class that dominates this
country and dominates global supply
chains
and if you want that to change you need
to fundamentally reorder
how power works and if you don't do
that we are not going to win
and that goes for like an actual
somewhat of a real step agenda like
bernie sanders
or even a small reform agenda
period case closed
