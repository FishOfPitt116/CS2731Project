more
on today's program ladies and gentlemen
uh look folks uh if i'm a little bit
my energy's a little bit down today if i
seem a little bit blue
it is because um
came in this morning and uh
i felt like i hadn't had
been in touch with someone who's been
important in my life for
quite some time and
i i went to twitter to make sure he was
all right
and i found that dave rubin blocked me
we will i don't want to start the show
on this kind of note
so we will talk about it later in the
program
but um yeah it's a sad day it really is
sad and i understand
look dave has joined the blaze tv
he's moved on to conservative world he's
come out in many ways and moved on with
his life and maybe i should move on with
mine
um but i'm not
quite convinced i'm going to we'll see
we'll talk about it later in the program
um either because i don't want to get uh
we've got too many other things to get
to before
um before we do yeah
and um however uh let's talk about this
at the time when brett kavanaugh was
having these hearings
we all knew the fbi did not have the
time that it needed to investigate
the actual claims
during the course of the
questioning of brett kavanaugh
i should say his sort of like yelling
every response as if
the volume and the anger he projects and
the indignation
that he can projects um is actually a
substitute for
the truth
during uh those hearings he was
questioned not just about what happened
with um
with dr blasey ford
but there were questions as to what
happened in
yale a woman who was a student at the
time
her name was deborah ramirez
claimed that at one point brett
kavanaugh
had basically thrust his penis into her
face
at a party at the time
kavanaugh said oh if that had happened
it would have been all over the yale
campus
well the new york times
i don't have the exact quote right in
front of me but the new york times
started off this
piece by saying that's what
brett kavanaugh said and we did some
reporting and we found that in fact
it was all over the yale campus that
many people knew about it
this is something obviously the fbi
could have found out with a little bit
more time
that was part of the reason why you
didn't give them more time
then in this same piece
a book written by robert pogarebin and
kate kelly two
new york times reporters as far as i
know um
citing two officials reporters said that
the former yale classmate
max steyer told senators and the fbi
about a different episode of alleged
sexual misconduct which also involved
uh brett kavanaugh whipping out his
penis and um
thrusting on another woman who was
not interested
now those two that second uh or this new
revelation
um the supposed alleged victim
and others refused to comment on it
but um
what is bizarre about this story is not
that uh this came out i mean look
the idea that
deborah ramirez or blasey ford would go
and put themselves
in harm's way
for no reason at all to lie about these
things the idea that
max steyer who went to the senate
he went to the fbi and to the senators
to give them the information that he had
and this is a guy who is a stanford law
grad
a former supreme court clerk
he runs a bipartisan center for public
service this is also not a guy who's
like you know what i'm going to just
take a leap on this and pretend like i
saw him do this
i mean
it would have been a much different
debate had brett kavanaugh come out and
said look i did some horrible things
when i was in college
and i would drink too much and i have
reflected on this and i think it's going
to make me a better judge because i
realize how horrible those things were
but that's not the grounds that they
want to fight this on they want to fight
this on the grounds that
it is irresponsible
to hold this man to account for what he
did
it is um just not the way things are
that is someone who's gone through um
these this type of
has this kind of pedigree and received
all the proper finishings
on that pedigree that he would have to
deal with this
wasn't the deal the deal was at the time
you get to do this
and it doesn't hurt you
it may hurt the women it may hurt the
victims whatever that doesn't matter
that's irrelevant they can recover
they'll bounce back
but the deal was as far as he understood
and then he
shows up here and it's like wait you're
you're changing the deal on me this is
an outrage
and uh so uh we have now i think about
half a dozen
presidential candidates are calling for
kavanaugh to be impeached
i mean because he lied he lied over and
over during that hearing we all knew it
i can't even remember what it was now
the the thing that he wrote in the
the yearbook as if it was some type of
homage we're not alumni yes
it was an homage homage to her we didn't
tell her about it at the time
we said it as something that we thought
you know his way of saying like she's
great we love
her she's terrific and then like oh yeah
we also hesitated to
let her know that we had actually
written that here's that here's that
that moment
ask you about renata dolphin who lives
in connecticut
she thought these yearbook statements
were quote
horrible hurtful and simply untrue end
quote
because renata alumni
clearly implied some boast of sexual
conquest and that's the reason that you
apologize to her correct
uh that's false speaking uh about the
yearbook and she she said she and i
never had any sexual interaction so your
question
your question is false and i've
addressed that in the
opening statement and so your question
is based on a false premise
and really does great harm to her i
don't know why you're bringing this up
frankly doing great harm to her by even
bringing her name up here
is really unfortunate well calling
someone
an alumnus in that way
implying what you're implying by a
number of your
football friends at the time as boasting
of sexual conflict
that's the reason that i'm bringing it
up yeah no it's false you're implying
that
look what you're bringing up right now
about her look what you're doing sherman
i ask that
her name is subtracted from my time i
mean
this indignation every single person in
that room knew he was lying his wife
his kids every single person in that
room knew he was lying
and it didn't make a difference guys
going to sit on the highest court in the
land
for the rest of his life for the rest of
some of our lives
and he was lying through his teeth
and if you don't think the ability to
admit that you did something wrong
when it was so blatantly obvious
if you don't think that having at least
the decency to say i am holding
one of the most important positions in
our society and i am going to show that
you
need to acknowledge the truth
and make an argument as to why you have
in some way changed or understand it
differently
i mean this stuff is like stuff that you
want your
27 year old boy to be able to deal with
never mind that they're gonna sit on the
court like you want that like you need
to be an adult enough to say
i messed up i messed up
i feel bad for it this is what i've done
to mitigate it
that's what you expect out of your
children as a parent
the idea that that's not immediately
satisfactory
or immediately to be expected and
required of a supreme court justice
and i'm not saying that you get that and
then you get a pass to go on the court
i'm just saying that's like
you have that responsibility if you're
in a position where you're speaking
publicly
in that context that's your minimum
that's the that's the minimum they
should require of you to walk through
the door
of that court of that senate hearing
and then we have sort of like this
ongoing participation in this farce
where the new york times in some way i
mean they just don't know how to deal
with this
it's an excerpt from a book that their
own reporters wrote
so they put it in the op-ed section
now that's fine but there's new
revelations and new reporting in there
and there should have been
a a a reported piece as well on the
front page
and then when they put it out
to to promote it on twitter this is what
they put
new york times opinion
having a penis thrust in your face at a
drunken dorm party may seem like
harmless fun
but when brett kavanaugh did it to her
deborah ramirez says
it confirmed that she didn't belong at
yale in the first place
like really
really does it seem like harmless fun to
like whom
like to like honestly having a penis
thrust in your face at a drunken dorm
party
may seem like harmless fun i would want
to sort of like get a sense of like from
whose perspective is that
from maybe the drunken penis guy
it might seem like harmless fun but i
have a feeling that just about
everybody on the other end of that
drunken penis
would not feel like it's harmless fun
and but but that's what your expectation
be harmless fun but
something very specific about this woman
that made her
feel somehow like she didn't belong
there
no the way this should be constructed is
when brett kavanaugh realized deborah
ramirez
might have a sense that she didn't
belong at yale she became
the perfect target
for it to be fun for him when he's drunk
to wave his penis in her
face in front of his friends we found
the most vulnerable person in this
general area
and then we just did to her what we
could do that's the way that this should
be constructed
they had to take this tweet down
because
of course
meanwhile some right winger
who's who is she now bethany mandel
uh her and seth mandel they're just
right
right wingers i'll get the outlet here
yeah she wrote
i live with guys uh all guys my senior
year of college
so in other words she chose
to room with guys
during her senior year in college
perfectly valid choice i went to a co-ed
dorm
school nice
i've opted in to live with guys
invariably
we're going to be exposed to stuff
that's fine she's ricochet media by the
way
and this happened to me literally every
day now i doubt
it did in the same context
but she clearly felt comfortable
in that area maybe the idea of consent
is too hard for her
go back go back please one of my
roommates walked around naked
every day
and then she puts in parens not avi
smolin
that's at avi smolin but also hi
remember this
laughter laughter laughter laughter
laughter laughter
and then avi smolin i guess
didn't think it was so funny he replied
to her
if i recall correctly our roommate
walked around in his underwear and i
think you asked him to cover up
and i think if i think if you asked him
to cover up he would have
if you did ask and he didn't then i'm
sorry i didn't act to help fix it then
i do believe deborah ramirez and uh
christine blasey ford and that we should
trust women when they come forward
in other words obvious mullen is saying
like i didn't like you then
i don't like you now
i think there's a real difference
between having friends
that you agree to live with who walk
around in their underwear
then having some drunken guy slap his
penis in your face at a party
and laugh about it
she's obviously not capable of seeing
that difference
um and i would say good for her
or at least fortunate for her that she's
never been victimized in such a way
it's not a question of like i'm so
strong that i can handle being around
guys who i'm friends with wearing
underwear
unbelievable unbelievable
and uh we now have two guys
who sit on the um supreme court who have
incredibly credible like shockingly
credible
accounts of um
sexual harassment levied against them
it's pretty stunning it's pretty
stunning
uh it is and it isn't exactly
it's a i guess a stunning reminder of
what is
in this country yeah the rules really
haven't changed that much
actually um
it's i
probably should have started with the
the dave rubin stuff
ask the moms ask the moms
i think we should ask the moms i think
there should be
i would love to see i would love to see
a
poll of moms when you send your daughter
to uh college
pro or against the idea of having
some drunk guy slap penis in her face
separate boat related how funny would
that be
for fun for some people yeah put it on
the intake form
on the orientation form i i i'm separate
uh but related i'd like to know uh about
the gambling deaths as well
yes but that's for another day right
right but hopefully someday
well i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure i'd like
to ask whoever about
somebody's uh ask the sackler family
want to go to another nationals game
folks
exactly did you know that human beings
have been shaving for over 5000 years

westhoff award-winning
investigative journalist author of
fentanyl inc we'll be right
back
we are back sam cedar on the majority
report on the phone it's a pleasure to
welcome to the program ben westhoff he's
an award-winning investigative
journalist and author of fentanyl
inc how rogue chemists are creating the
deadliest wave
of the opioid epidemic ben welcome to
the program
thanks for having me sam um a lot of
news
literally today and in the past couple
of days
about the legal cases
um against the against purdue pharma
against ones that we may see against the
sacklers uh
there is uh the u.s the uh new york
state ag
is looking into uh reports that
sackler's wired money out of uh you know
different funds and whatnot ostensibly
to uh
pay you know some of their fines or
avoid some of their fines or or who
knows what
um this is going to be ongoing and
um you're writing about fentanyl which
um
um is what you've called basically
and maybe not just you uh i think the
cdc the third wave of the opioid
epidemic walk us through um
those waves and the then we'll
we'll talk about sort of the history of
fentanyl because fentanyl
is of a different ilk
i guess of of drugs which is going to be
really the problem of the future
yeah the first wave of the opioid
epidemic started in the 90s
and that was the prescription pills
like oxycontin and doctors began
over prescribing these pills and
then when patients their prescriptions
ran out
a lot of them started turning to street
heroin
these were you know law abiding citizens
but heroin had this
met the same kind of craving and so that
was the second wave
of the opioid epidemic now it's almost
impossible to find
pure heroin anywhere you know most parts
of the united states
it's all being cut with fentanyl
and fentanyl represents the third wave
of the opioid epidemic
it's much more powerful than heroin
about a hundred times stronger and so
when it's
cut into fentanyl people don't even know
it's there
and a lot of people die immediately
and we should say that the over
prescription
of the opioids was there was a bunch of
different choke points
where sort of things i want to say
faltered but it really was in many
instances
malfeasance i mean arguably the doctors
uh
you know were the the least uh
mouthy maybe they were most misfeasant
but they were basically sold on this
idea that
this class of opioids was non-addictive
because of the way that it had been
constructed i guess
uh which like you uh imply um didn't
turn out that way
and they probably should have been aware
of it when they were selling
millions of pills into you know to
counties with with
significantly less people um yeah
so let give us this history of fentanyl
and
and and it is part of
a class of drugs that
um is called got it right here the novel
psychoactive substances um first just
give us the history of of how fentanyl
got introduced
into the country and then let's talk
about the the implications
of novel psychoactive substances
fentanyl was created in the late 1950s
as a totally
legitimate medical drug it was made by a
belgian
chemist and it was used in things like
open heart surgery and it's still a very
important
widely used hospital drug for things
like
epidurals and childbirth and
colonoscopies
but the fentanyl that we're hearing
about mostly is
not this fentanyl the fentanyl that's
killing
people is made illicitly almost all of
it
in china and it's made in
labs there and often it's sent directly
through the mail
to u.s consumers people can just order
it off the internet people you know drug
users drug dealers
and it's also channeled through the
mexican cartels
and they buy it from china package it up
and then send it north into the u.s
through across the border
so we have so how is this i mean
when you describe this dynamic how is it
related
to the it seems like there's it's
running in parallel
to the opioid crisis and it seems also
that it's in in another
respect it is an extension of the opioid
crisis
yeah that's exactly right it is you know
basically the same
chemical structure the similar chemical
structure similar effects to
morphine heroin oxycontin all of these
opioids and opiates we keep hearing
about
so it's piggybacking on the opioid
crisis
but the problem is it's making things
much worse
so whereas deaths from prescription
pills
and deaths from heroin are falling
in recent years deaths from fentanyl
are actually increasing every year so
it's
it's a really bad situation and we're
talking about tens of thousands of
deaths right
yeah there's more than 30 000 deaths
from fentanyl alone
in 2018 and so
what percentage of those so let's i mean
i just want to clearly delineate these
two sort of like
categories of problems that we're
dealing with one is
that um we have people who became
addicted to uh opioid pain medication
they um they move to
street heroin and then i guess uh you
know part of the problem
at that instance is um a lot of that
street handle
heroin is now laced with fentanyl and it
um ends up killing people it seems the
other and maybe there's like three
different versions because that's sort
of the hybrid
then there seems to be one that is
exclusively a function of like
people just taking other drugs and
getting fentanyl and not being aware of
it and then
there's also i would imagine still on
some level
and maybe this has ended and because of
of greater awareness
an over prescription of fentanyl i you
know
know people who were uh
prescribed fentanyl as a um
you know sort of like a chronic pain um
uh you know solution yeah and you know
i have a uh someone i know fairly well
who
ended up having to go to a clinic uh an
inp
as an inpatient and you know when people
around there saw him
and the amount of fentanyl he was taking
they were like we don't meet many people
like you who are alive
anymore uh i believe it yeah someone's
tolerance can go up high
in fact a common thing has been for
people to buy the
fentanyl patches off the black market
and
the patches are for people with cancer
or other
or other types of chronic pain and
you know you're supposed to use one but
sometimes addicted users will put on two
three or more on their body and
there's often hospital fentanyl that is
misappropriated
stolen by anesthesiologists and other
people working in hospitals but
but the biggest problem the biggest way
that fentanyl is abused
is on the streets and the problem is
that
most people really don't want it like
you said
they want other drugs that fentanyl has
cut into so
it's cut into not just heroin but
cocaine and meth and prescription pills
and so it's a way to for drug dealers to
save money and that's how people like
prince died
prince thought he was taking a
legitimate pharmaceutical pill
a narcotic but it was actually a fake
pill
that had fentanyl in it now how does
prince get a
fake pill like i mean isn't he going is
this not
a non-prescription situation was he
buying it like he just somebody was
supplying him with with stuff that
they got a bad shipment or something
yeah
the the guy who got him the pills was
not
a doctor he was procuring it
on a black market of some sort but that
guy's not really talking exactly where
he got it from but
it happens all the time because what
people do is they buy pill presses these
industrial
drug dealers and manufacturers they buy
pill presses
and stamp pills to look exactly like the
real thing
so there was another another big
musician
mac miller a rapper who thought he was
taking an
oxycontin pill and it looked exactly
like
one but it was made on one of these pill
presses and it had fentanyl and he died
right away so the the the person who's
selling this
they they're thinking like okay fentanyl
is cheaper
i'm gonna make it look like it's an
oxycontin pill the
the user's not gonna get really a sense
of that it's different and i'm going to
be able to sell a ton of these
they just don't realize they just don't
know how to do the proper dosage or is
it just that
that's that's exactly right yeah and
it's
almost impossible to properly dose it
unless you're
a trained chemist pharmaceutical
engineer in a lab because it's such a
tiny dose of fentanyl
to make someone overdose it's less than
two grains of rice
and so trying to mix that up into a
solution of something else
mix it with other drugs is pretty much
impossible
for someone without training okay so we
we've moved into this sort of like a
second
um or or third sort of like uh track
here of of
of what is problematic and this is the
one that you pursued
that we have this is not as tied into
the idea of of drug companies
uh it may have been sparked in some
respect by the demand
uh that the this opioid crisis um
uh developed but it's not it's no longer
it's sort of like
the the solution set for this is a very
very different um
uh one it seems to me because the
problem is
relatively like the the problem
it seems to me and and then when i talk
about what you discovered when you went
to china is that
not only is this a classic case of
of of you know sort of outside
importation of of illicit drugs
but the the nature of
manufacturing of these drugs creates a
whole different set of problems
yeah that's correct when you think about
opiates traditional drugs like
heroin which comes from the opium poppy
and that has to be grown in a field
and that takes a long time it's
susceptible to law enforcement
discovering
these fields but these new drugs
like fentanyl are all made in a lab
and so it's much cheaper it's much
quicker
and as i said it's much more powerful
and so
china as a epicenter for drugs
is a pretty new phenomenon you know
traditionally americans have gotten
their drugs from places like mexico or
colombia
or afghanistan but china has a
particularly it's an it's a new problem
because
the people making these drugs in china
are not cartel members they're not
big criminal masterminds for the most
part they're just
regular chemists they're drug chemists
they're businessmen
business women and they're just trying
to make money
a lot of them actually operate within
chinese law they make stuff that's legal
in china
but it's illegal in the u.s and they
smuggle it over
and so that's what i went to china to
investigate
um walk us through um
let's talk about your your investigation
in china but but
will you just also explain the dynamic
and
and i guess i was aware of this as as a
college student when mdma
first came on the scene i i think
probably
the first time that i was exposed to it
i think it was
legal um or very you know
uh or nearly legal in the sense that
there
the way that we outlaw contraband
you know or put on the contraband list
uh when we talk about
um lab created drugs
is basically the chemical structure but
you can change
one small connection between the carbon
atom and the you know uh the oxygen atom
i don't know what i'm talking about but
but something to that effect and and it
it suddenly becomes legal again
without a tremendous change in the
impact of the drug is that right
yeah that is right in the u.s
for the most part we've kind of got a
blanket ban
for these type of manipulations you're
talking about so it doesn't apply in the
u.s much anymore
but in china they have to ban each new
drug individually and so you take
something like fentanyl
and you you switch the chemical formula
just a tiny bit
and you've got something now that still
has the more or less the same effects as
fentanyl
but now it's legal and china has
has tamped down on that a lot but
but other drugs too like you said with
ecstasy
with synthetic marijuana like fake
marijuana like k2 and spice it's
sometimes called
there are literally hundreds and
hundreds
of new variations of these drugs that
can be made in these chinese
laboratories and then
poof all of a sudden they're legal and i
imagine
too that there's nobody there going like
oh you know we changed this uh
structure a little bit i'm gonna take it
and i can tell you
you really only should take three
quarters of this pill as opposed to a
full core
you know uh a full pill that we used to
take right i mean there's nobody out
there there's no
there's no regulation even on the china
side about like
what constitutes the dosage for this
stuff no
no there's no human testing at all so
that means that
the people taking these drugs are
basically human guinea pigs
so all right tell us what you found in
china because this we're basically just
talking about
small businesses that have an import
export business
they produce this stuff and they
probably have a third party that does
the smuggling right so they just supply
it to somebody and i don't know in
switzerland and then that person
ends up doing i mean how do how does it
work how like
in in what are the different ways that
this fentanyl which you know
is basically it's just it's it's poison
right i mean it's basically some type of
filler
in this context it's just poison filler
that is used either as
you know people want to buy fentanyl or
but more likely used as like some type
of
it sounds like um like i don't know
like like the way the corn is in all our
food they just want to put it in all the
drugs because it's cheaper
yeah that's right some people do want
fentanyl
most people don't but i kept hearing
that all these drugs like fentanyl were
made in china
but no reporter had ever been in one of
these labs
and so i wanted to do that i wanted to
go and so
i just started emailing these different
companies in in labs and i said
i pretended to be a drug dealer i asked
if i could come visit the lab if i came
to china and they said sure
how do you pretend to be a drug dealer
did you just say
i just said i was one you know i used a
fake email address i
there wasn't really much vetting that's
for sure
okay what was the email address was it
something like uh they know i sell you
drugs
gmail.com or something like that or no
these were just
totally if you looked at the websites
for these companies you would think they
were legitimate
chinese chemical companies and they had
they didn't just have drugs they had
thousands of chemicals
on their websites and they said they
would custom
make any chemical you want so that's one
sign
that they're they're up to no good um
but
i they said i could visit and so i did i
went to china last year
and i met up with one chemist in
shanghai
he drove me he had this kind of beefy
driver
this kind of muscled guy who i was
worried was the
you know the muscle of the operation i
was a little nervous
but when i got to the lab i was
expecting a
sort of underground you know seedy
den of iniquity with guys and guns
you know guarding the door or something
but it wasn't like that at all it was
basically a
suburban office park with a fountain
you know in the middle of it and we
parked and went up the elevator
and the lab was um
it looked just kind of like a high
school or a college lab it
it was bigger they were making huge
amounts of these different types of
fentanyl
and other drugs but it to me just
was not at all what i was expecting and
i
you know i didn't buy anything i didn't
give them any money
but i did get a chance to see what these
places were really like
um so and were they basically did they
give you a tour of their
their products and basically say like
this is how we do it and and this is
are they are they selling you on the
quality control i mean what
like when they're taking you around they
think you're a buyer what do they think
that you want to hear
yeah they just wanted to i i told them i
needed to see that the
quality of the lab was up to my
standards
and so they were trying to impress me
with their lab
and and yeah the quality you know they
print out sheets
when they send these drugs through the
mail and it says like you know 95
purity whatnot and there's also
kind of uh advanced smuggling that that
often goes on too and so they
send these drugs in packages with like
that are meant to look like dog
food was one i saw another one was meant
to look like
dried banana snacks and these are to
help get around u.s
customs and they're they're very
effective at
you know sending these drugs through the
mail that way
um all right and so we and were you
afraid of the chinese government at all
when you were over there
yeah i was almost more worried of the
government than i was
about the the drug dealers because
i could have been put in jail for
something like doing this doing this
investigation
and um you know there wouldn't have been
due process or
anything like that um and
uh how many other places did you see on
your trip did you go
was it just that one facility or were
there others
i also went to a place in a city called
wuhan which is a big chemical
and industrial epicenter in the middle
of the country
and there i went to a sales floor
where they were selling fentanyl
precursors
so these are the most important
ingredients to make fentanyl
and so i beforehand i chatted with a
bunch of the salespeople on skype
and they told me that they were sending
huge quantities of these
fentanyl precursors to the mexican
cartels
they didn't say the cartels but they
said their all their sales were going to
mexico so it's not
very difficult to put that together and
but again i was shocked when i got to
this company because there were hundreds
and hundreds
of these sales people in cubicles
behind computers almost all of them were
like mid-20s they were college graduates
this was a sales job for them and they
got good benefits
free cell phones and there they all were
just selling
these fentanyl ingredients like it was
an a legitimate chemical wow so they're
basically just
taking orders constantly from cartels
creating fentanyl
yep exactly and from my reporting for my
book
i concluded that this company
was selling more of these fentanyl
ingredients
than any other company in the world and
turns out they have 700
employees and branches all over china
and and so and so this stuff is then
going to mexico and presumably in some
labs in mexico
yeah it's a lot less sophisticated
mexican mexico doesn't have the chemical
industry they train
chemists to make fentanyl from scratch
but when they get these ingredients it's
already like 90
of the way there and so the cartels just
finish it
package it up and they send it across
the border into the us
so this is i mean it is
a particularly unique problem it
feels like in terms of i mean that we
have faced in terms
of of drugs because it's not just a
question of people
oding on stuff that they're aware
they're
taking it's that there are different
sort of seems like
classes that that are problematic with
this is that people are taking stuff
that they don't realize the fentanyl is
in
um plus they are taking
a a substance that you know i guess to a
certain extent you could say this about
lsd which
created in math to a certain extent um
but this is one which
um because of the way that it's created
is
very difficult to get a sense of like
of how to you know to self
diagnose what your dosage should be um
it seems like there's a whole host of
problems around this that
um there's really no mechanism in which
to deal with in our law enforcement
structure
that's exactly right and the way i put
it in the book is that
the pablo escobars of today
are operating in china without any fear
that their government is going to put
them in jail
and so that's the that's really the
problem is that the laws in china are
such that
a lot of these people are operating
totally legally
and that's what i witnessed when i was
there
do you think that if the chinese
government was to say all right look you
cannot
sell you cannot manufacture you cannot
sell the components to manufacturer
uh that that would take care of the
problem
i don't think it would take care of the
problem but it would help a lot
and china has already banned
these fentanyl analogs and
i think if they banned the fentanyl
precursors that would
do a lot because like i said these are
just
businessmen they want to operate within
the law
because it's too expensive to you know
risk getting caught and things like that
and so that is definitely the first step
is
is changing these laws what would be the
second step
i mean it seems like on the uh i mean
that we can do something on the supply
and it seems relatively easy at this
point in china not we
uh you know i guess maybe that would be
a point of negotiation
with the chinese in terms of the supply
uh because it's just
you got to go back to just knocking off
legal drugs
or drugs that don't have the ability to
kill people on some level
um but
what do we do on the demand side
well that's a really good question and
one thing i really advocate for is
something called
fentanyl testing strips and so like i
said
most people don't want fentanyl and
don't even know it's in their drugs
but these strips they're very
cheap and what they can do is they can
test to see if fentanyl is
in your drugs they're kind of like a
pregnancy test you dip it in a solution
of your drugs
and if there's one line on the strip it
means there is fentanyl if there's two
lines
it means no fentanyl and so studies have
already shown that people who use these
and find fentanyl are less likely
to use and overdose so that's
that's one thing i advocate for what are
the different programs that we could
institute that would deal with it i mean
obviously like at this point
right it's you're losing
30 000 people a year to
this drug the idea of
decriminalizing it at the very least
so that you can sort of institutionalize
and provide support for that type of
simple test
seems completely obvious because it's in
particular because it's a drug that
people don't even want so the idea of
like
of of decriminalizing it it's not like
more people are going to go out like i'm
going to try
fentanyl now like there's is there
anybody in the country who's going like
i would try fentanyl but it's illegal so
i'm not going to
that's that's a good point yeah i i
agree with that
absolutely you look at countries like
portugal and spain
and they've decriminalized drugs
and you know even even the strong drugs
even the
the hard drugs and when it comes to
users in the u.s a lot of people
want to distinguish between users and
dealers for example so we should give
care and treatment to the users
but we should lock up the dealers
but in the case of the small dealers
these are often just people who are
addicted users themselves and they only
started selling
to support their own habit and so i
think if you decriminalize you take away
this market for all these drug dealers
to make all this money
and you bring people out of the shadows
you help them get
the treatment they need instead of
putting them in jail
where when they get out they're most
likely to to go back on again
uh is there anywhere i mean is is
you know based upon our uh what you see
across the country is there any any
areas
that you're seeing specifically pilot
programs that are working best with this
or
yeah actually in new england is where
the fentanyl problem started and that's
where it really hit the hardest now it's
kind of moving
west across the country and it's really
bad in the midwest where i'm located
but in new england now they're actually
seeing
death rates drop from these drugs and
that has a lot to do
with these programs are called
medication assisted treatment
they're using low-level opioids like
methadone and suboxone
to help people taper off they've things
like the
the medicaid funding has gone to help
lots and lots of people who need this so
only a tiny fraction
of addicted users are able to get
the treatment to get any treatment at
all
and there's also even more radical
solutions available that
are illegal in the u.s but they had they
use them in places like canada and
europe
and this the one i'm thinking of is
called is called supervised injection
facilities and that's where you legally
allow someone
to shoot up heroin fentanyl
or really to use any drug but they get
clean needles
they're overseen by professionals
doctors and nurses
and they get the support they need and
no one has ever died
in one of these facilities but like i
said they're illegal in the us
of course of course yeah why wouldn't
they be
um unbelievable well it's a fascinating
uh story and i have a feeling it's going
to be one that is going to dominate the
the headlines for for years to come not
unlike uh what we saw with opioids in
the past couple of years
uh ben westhoff fentanyl inc
how rogue chemists are creating the
deadliest wave of the opioid epidemic
we'll put a link at majority.fm
and within the podcast description
thanks so much for your time today i
really appreciate it
well thanks for having me on sam all
right folks
we're gonna
maybe we should just do this part uh
for the free freebies dave
dave rubin
ladies and gentlemen for past couple
years
one of the things that i spent my time
on
i sat down with a team seater
we do this every six to ten weeks
we do a evaluation of uh what i should
be doing with my time
what uh projects would be the best
use of both my time my skill set and
best for society
and uh sometime in uh i think it was
late 2015 maybe early 2016
a team gathered round there's a couple
of folks on the team who presented a
um powerpoint presentation suggesting
that
one of the things i should be focusing
on is dave rubin pretending
uh to be of the left to pretend uh you
know
um branding himself as the last liberal
and therefore was in a perfect position
to critique the left
because as a liberal the party had left
him
the the ideology had left him um
and his bonafides at that time were
impeccable he was someone who was
against identity politics
but also made it very clear that he was
gay and married
he was against the death penalty
at the time he was forced single-payer
health care
though it subsequently became clear that
he didn't know what that meant
and was also for limited
limited government uh which if you know
anything about
single-payer healthcare you know is
probably
the greatest expansion of government
that we could have
um what else was he for he was uh
well he was for marriage equality and
probably one or two other things oh did
you say gun control uh
sir recently you're saying what's the
point right right exactly
he's made some transitions he was
pro-choice
now he's very reluctantly pro-choice in
fact uh now these block me i can't tell
when he's going to actually make this
pivot
um recently he signed on with the blaze
this is after
signing out with talking turning points
usa last year
for funding and uh the libertarian uh
uh funding that he got uh the idrand
institute iron rand institute which of
course is funded by the koch brothers
uh by you know maybe one or two um
contributions downstream or upstream i
should say so
and uh all this time
i asked dave to come on the show or i
would go on his show or we could meet
somewhere
and have a conversation now
we're gonna go back and sort of i don't
know maybe play a little bit of a slide
show as you can see dave rubin has
blocked me
and uh i'm gonna go through this uh
slide show
some of the tweets
just uh bring some people's hey ruben
report sincere question
have you or you show ever received
funding directly from the mercers or
from a mercer fam a funded
entity he never responded
um
[Music]
i asked that dave back in october of
2017 how do you square your desire for
limited government with your support of
single-payer healthcare seems to be
at odds elaborate and um
never heard never heard about this
now his book at that time was in the
works and sound like he was teeing up
his book tour and i really wanted to
make sure that if
anybody ever wrote about his book
they'd have to search and see the tweets
that we had
in between each other people can use
this one uh
go ahead um at one point he did
[Music]
oh this of course was when someone
pranked dave and i thought that was
really wrong
um with a hundred dollar uh super chat
question asking him to debate me
and he mumbled jumbled he wouldn't do it
and
um and then i asked him you know i
understood why i didn't want to mention
my name but
please give him back his money and
youtube did yeah
you two did all worked out um
and then dave asked me at one point
um dave claims that uh
so josh harkin said why won't you uh
debate me or sam cedar and so he replied
to
parkinson and now just to be clear he
called harkin he said that harkinson
called him some bad things like
alt-right or whatnot
and uh defamed him i think at one point
and then he invited him on
and then apparently harkinson said no as
he wrote i invited you declined you're
embarrassing yourself supporting free
speech has nothing to do with
uh with which guests i choose and then i
wrote
the question seems to be why won't you
invite me and dave responded to me back
then
this is june of 2017 got your email
request for an interview
you just posted a video titled dave
rubin professionally stupid
all past and not interacting further now
i want to make it clear it's not a video
he said you posted a video because the
the video was posted it was
michael being rude
and uh someone else just said title yeah
yes i just wanted to be clear
we were rude in the video and
you know the great kelly was rude in the
title
right okay so there was a lot of rude
people around here and i
i i just got to be fair i suggested that
title to kelly
so there was a pipeline from the content
i said to matt's suggestion
to kelly's execution so there's a lot of
people questioning dave's intelligence
and then i wrote i admit to not viewing
the video but the title was rude
i think because i was responsive ruben
report will accept my apology and have
me on because i
i apologized not only as you apologized
you literally silenced and violated my
free speech i pulled down the video you
assaulted the marketplace of ideas on
behalf of dave rubin
which surprised me i thought he'd
immediately demand it be put back
up and i asked him i think this was
earlier why won't you have me on in the
spirit of genuine exchange of ideas and
he goes all i really know about you is
from the dickish tweets you've been
sending me
maybe you should have tried email and
that's i guess when i did try
why'd he go at home and then i went down
and i said um i think most have been uh
quite polite you made a critical request
for suggestions from the left i
responded happy to email though and i
did email and then he
found that video that michael did and
even though i took that down
and publicly apologized for the rudeness
displayed
by my rude people here
and um believe me i i docked everybody
here
a lot of people didn't get dessert that
day at the commissary
yep and then then coming up uh this year
hey reuben report condolences it seems
the idw is calling the herd
this is of course uh from a quillette
piece
hang in there brother seems like nobody
on the right's open to ideas want to
come on the show to discuss
solidarity i tried to reach out
to dave um
wait go backwards right where's that
retraction retraction
uh yeah this is uh and dave i asked him
to
uh you know refund the money and i go uh
and i said um
i said congratulations if true that
you've refunded the money and then i
retracted it because i was informed that
dave did not refund the payment for the
super chat he censored
youtube refunded so i wanted to retract
my claim that rube
report had uh some integrity in doing so
no excuses this is on me my apologies i
will double my efforts to do better
i wanted to just straight shooter folks
straight shooter that's what i've been
trying to do
and uh well that's our little uh walk
down memory or lane we're back stuck
here with the reuben report
we also have the first time you ever
mentioned ruben report on twitter if you
want to go oh yeah this is the first
time okay so um i
was responding to a pbs newshour is
attempting uh
i had a tweet that said no labels is
attempting to bridge the divide between
left and right jon huntsman and joe
lieberman on newshour
and then i put l-o-l which uh
was a a thing that the kids used at that
time meaning laugh out loud
and um and then someone called me
regressive
yeah persian atheist uh called you
aggressive
oh yeah persian atheist and uh i wrote
an atheist i don't know who that
interacts with me
i believe if it's the same person this
is somebody who had a lot of like
michael what you should do is slow down
sam harris's podcast so you can hear
each individual
word he's saying and then you won't take
him out of context
so he called me intellectually coherent
regressive and i responded
silly and then uh he said ask sir dave
rubin about the regressives and tyt and
he tags reuben report
and i wrote no thanks sounds silly but
not fun
and uh that was back in the time how
little you knew how fun it would be i
was going to say that was not
good forecasting on your part no it's i
said well i mean look it
sounded silly but not fun but it turned
out to be a lot of fun
and uh extremely silly yeah which let
that be a lesson for you if there's any
moral that i want you to take from my
relationship with dave
which uh seems to have come to an end
not by my choice it's not the first time
i've been jilted it'll take a little
while um
i'll probably you know spy on him by
going through another account or
hopping on instagram and seeing what
he's up to
and you know maybe even join facebook
just to follow and say dave i want to
hear about ideas
well just i want to know what you become
pro-life
the hardest the hardest part the hardest
part
now that he's moved on to the blaze and
this and that the hardest part to sort
of get past
is and i will cop to this the idea that
i know
at one point dave's gonna find another
nemesis
and they're going to go back and forth
on twitter and dave's going to
pretend like he's ignoring them and then
and it's just it's hard for me to
contemplate that being somebody but me
and um but i do want to say this to dave
listen if you change your mind just
simply
flick that switch man and unblock me and
we can just
start over and maybe try and recapture a
little bit of what we had
um if there was something specific i
could change
to to allow us to start anew i will do
it
um you have my twitter feed so
perhaps i could have poked or prodded in
another way but i felt
trying to figure out why he thinks as he
does is what my job is
goodbye dave all right folks
i'm probably going to need a little
minute as we go to the fun half to just
collect myself but just a reminder that

we can talk about just about anything um
one of the things i'm i'm personally
reading at the moment not
not at this exact moment but a piece by
ian melheiser who has now moved over to
uh vox
talking about a uh a legal paper that
was written
about 10 years ago by two professors
both of whom were have pretty impeccable
right wing credentials
libertarian credentials
and uh one was or one is
a former law clerk i should say one is a
former law clerk to justice thomas
one is a um
you know a frequent contributor to um
right-wing uh
legal journals and uh they believe that
there is a judicial process
a non-impeachment process that can be
applied to
federal judges um
if they have um
not maintained good behavior
i know i'll go i'll read that a little
more carefully and go into it um
later but it's going to be an
interesting that what we're going to see
particularly in the event the democrats
win
is we're going to see a lot of
people doing research on how
to work around
the issue of the us senate
frankly and
in some instances it may be like bernie
sanders brought up the other day
reconciliation
uh on uh some major pieces of
legislation that's
somewhat controversial people don't know
if you could fit
all this legislation into a
reconciliation bill remember it has to
have a direct bearing on the budget
that determination is made by the
parliamentarian however
the senate pro temp of the or the
the senate president can overrule the
parliamentarian
with a 50 person 51 person vote
that person would be the vice president
hard to know though that you could get
let's say chris coons
to vote not for filibuster reform but
you for this i mean so who knows
no let's talk about um
chris coons i've said chris coon's name
i don't know maybe a dozen times on this
show over the years
and it seems that it's always in the
context of him
throwing water on any
potential sparks of actual change
in this country he
literally i mean if there's a single
individual in the country
who spends any time thinking about
politics is not aware of what the
republican party has done in regards to
the judicial
they refused to have hearings for
merrick garland unprecedented
they were completely obstructionist
during the obama years
they widely used blue slips as a way of
preventing judges from sitting
on federal courts then they took all
those vacancies including merrick
garland they got rid of
filibusters for all judges
they got rid of honoring blue strips uh
slips
from states that had two democratic
senators even
they've ran through the highest number
of judges in the history i think
of any first term president with
lifetime appointments
chris coons response to what will you
guys do if the senate takes over the
if the democrats take over the senate i
think the first thing we should do is
reinstate
the filibuster to give republicans the
opportunity
to completely obstruct again
that was uh the horny was only but now
he's starting to see
like hey wait a second democrats could
take over the senate
i've got to begin to position myself
right in the center i mean this is one
of the things that we heard about the
context years ago about
reforming the filibuster you could
change the number that is necessary
but whatever number you sit there's
going to be some democratic senators who
are going to say like i'm going to
position myself to be that number
you need 55 people i'm going to be vote
55
i'm going to be vote 54.
and chris coons is
maybe in his mind i'm going to be vote
51.
you can you can worry about joe manchin
but uh joe laberman
hold my beer and along those lines here
he is
on fox and friends today uh if it
is tied directly to iran what's
appropriate action
well first i want america i want to see
the intelligence um but it seems
credible that the houthis
don't have the sort of advanced drones
that carried out this crippling strike
on saudi oil facilities
my hope is that the president will
consult with his generals his diplomats
his advisors
will look hard at the intelligence iran
is one of the the most dangerous
state sponsors of terrorism this may
well be the thing that calls for
military action against iran
if that's what the intelligence supports
what about people who say you know we
got our own oil we don't need that oil
as much as we used to
not our problem what would you say to
that um i'd say one of the things that
has kept america safe and secure for
seven decades
is a global network of alliances
obviously
our alliance with the saudis has been
badly strained by the murder of
khashoggi
and by some of the other things that mbs
the crown prince has done
but this is a moment where iran is
really pushing
our resolve and is really testing to see
whether we're actually going to stand up
and if there's a tax by iran on our
close allies like jordan
israel or the saudis we need to take
seriously
taking action again i think it would be
great to know that republicans
and uh democrats would be behind that
action if it should take place and the
evidence would be as overwhelming as it
seems
yeah there you have it democrats and
republicans that's what he's doing he's
providing cover for
a new war um a couple of things that
stuck out to me you know those
other things that the saudis are doing
that's straining our relationship with
them
they're using our weapons
our facilities our support
to kill thousands of people
thousands of people in yemen oh hundreds
of thousands of people and
the dynamic is almost exactly like
the dynamic they claim the houthis uh
have with iran
you know we are enabling the killings
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
of people in yemen
and when the rebels essentially or the
civil war
uh fire back
on the people that are attacking them i
mean let's be honest here
this is not terrorism right
this is saudi arabia is engaged in a
an air war with that country
well they have struck back i mean and
just to just to fill it out a little bit
100 right also sudanese
uh military forces which have been
subcontracted by the saudis are on the
ground
there committing other atrocities so
they actually have troops on the ground
through the sudan
they've killed hundreds of thousands of
airstrikes but there's also been cholera
outbreaks and food shortages
and it is an international i mean there
is zero debate for anybody who takes
international law seriously which chris
goons probably does not though he would
cite it
uh that yes if you are fighting an
occupying force
that definitionally i mean not only is
it not terrorism it's legal
it is a it is a correct action it is a
justified action but
i mean and we should not accept this
talking point that like oh there's no
way zahuti's could have done this
they might have gotten the art you know
one of the things that's so terrifying
about drones now is that a lot of drones
aren't even that technical
are we going to hold countries that sell
weapons well there you go to uh fighting
parties
responsible for the use of those weapons
because
i get some bad news for us if that's the
case yeah if the bad news would be that
by that logic the houthis should be able
to drop
drone strikes on our facilities of
course of course
exact reality and not just the houthis
everybody
there's probably not a country on earth
i mean that's setting a
uh i i i don't know that we want to go
down that road where that becomes
the um the uh
the justification for war but i there's
another option that chris coons doesn't
talk about
if he's very concerned about supporting
our allies and that is
let's not be allies with saudi arabia
anymore well you have to be so demented
to still be married to this israel-saudi
axis
in the middle east with all of the
atrocities that those countries commit
and all the problems that that basic
structure causes
and you know it went back to the deal
with iran
that the saudis and the israelis were so
upset
not because of you know the non-crazy
people understood it was a good deal
and that it wasn't a threat to them but
just the idea that the united states
might start to have like a rational
non-biased view of the middle east as a
fundamental threat to their own
hegemonic ambitions
let's watch fox and friends further go
on
to uh cheerleading this is awful so
awful
to cheerlead this uh war with iran
now back in the day when
the u.s invaded and occupied illegally
iraq
some of us hippies as you can see
uh would say like there's no reason to
do this
he's no threat to us this is just about
oil
not just iraqi oil but also being able
to have a beachhead in a region that
in some way it's basically less about us
getting the oil because they would say
well how come oil is
more expensive now um
anybody who has been to a keg party
understands the value of having your
friends control the keg
control the tap because then you can
just cut lines you say yeah
give me a cup of beer please
and you don't have to wait in line
that's basically i think
what the us uh foreign policy has been
we want to be the guys controlling the
tap we may not give it to america
for first but we may want to
control the tap here's fox and friends
they don't even they forgot that this
was the premise of wars that we don't
want to get involved in
now it's just being sold that way iran
attacks saudi arabia as it has over 100
times
uh we are prepared to take action well
the question is what is that going to be
and they have provoked us before i mean
think about the
tankers they have seized they shot one
of our drones out of the sky
oh and now it looks like this even
though the hoodie rebels are saying oh
we did it a hundred percent
yeah right we have we have video of all
of it you imagine being on a
national news show and just going like
foodie rep like he doesn't know
there's no doubt in my mind that maybe
the first time the words hootie rebels
came out
you don't think steve ducey fluent in
the politics of yemen right oh oh yeah
right you did sure right sure you know
brian i was reading about
cootie rebels before it was fashionable
i think we all know they don't have that
kind of got to the office at 2am to look
at the
operational yeah oh we did it 100
yeah right we have we have video of all
that you just know it by the way two
things number one
the drone attacks extremely disturbing
uh from a security standpoint
what stops it from happening here number
two
well what stops it from happening here
do you hear anything
we've got to stop the drones over there
before they come over here
i got i mean this is just this is like
this is pre-iraq invasion this is but
this is
d team level pro-war propaganda
we got to stop the we got to stop the
the iranian drones
over there before they get here
from a security standpoint what stops it
from happening here
number two is we have to keep the strait
of hormuz open and we got to protect the
world's oil supply that just comes with
being a
being the united states of america even
though we make a lot of it ourselves
we have to in this case make sure the
middle east has a sense
of normalcy and that's got to happen and
the europeans should step up as well
as we go after the cause so we will be
covering that
right but kellyanne conway makes a great
point you know why are we dependent on
somebody else
or our energy exactly right but we do
have a responsibility to the free world
we have the number one defense
uh and i think we should not deduct from
that responsibility
yeah we have killmead is does he is kill
me
is personally anxious oh yeah yeah
the whole thing is just amazing like oh
yeah no we do we do we can pay for our
own oil but we need to
we have a responsibility because we've
spent all this money
on uh creating the most massive defense
force in the world like
the you know all the others combined two
times over i also i do dig the frame
that we need to ensure some sense of
normalcy in the region by starting like
a
absolutely catastrophic war that's
actually kill an
untold amount of people and destabilize
the place like
almost apocalyptically to be fair to be
fair
based upon what we did in the last 20
years
pretty close to be pretty normal normal
us action yep
look normal us spill out the region is
being destabilized
because of the lack of major invading
force
uh that is coming in look i understand
yemen and syria are both
absolute bloodbaths there's multiple
proxy wars the israelis are starting to
more overtly bomb syria but it's just
it's still it's too chill we need to
have a for invasion of iran
it really is mask off time for these
people which i kind of appreciate
at least they're not talking about human
rights anymore you know it's
total um exactly it's totally
but it's d team stuff like oh god i
can't wait to go to those rallies where
people like
they shot down our drone man
we gotta fight we're going to put a boot
in your ass
i can't wait to all the the songs that
come out
about uh about that time right the
houthis shot our drone down and we got
to stop the drones
we'll fly a drone over your house it's
the american way yeah
it gets a lot less metaphorical
you count as civilians that's the
american what trump just tweets out
plenty of oil
exclamation point yesterday yeah plenty
of oil um
there's also something very strange
that's going on that is um that is
that i want to call your attention to
that um
i think is going to have some pretty big
implications
going forward in terms of
of uh hearings i mean right now
we are what the democrats are doing i
don't think politically
it makes any sense and frankly
it doesn't make a ton of sense uh to me
in terms of just
pure from like a policy standpoint but
they are
investigating the bringing of
impeachment um articles of impeachment
it's not quite an impeachment inquiry
because they haven't sort of like
put themselves into impeachment mode but
according to adam schiff
they are in a mode that they're that
there should
their subpoenas should be favored by
courts i don't know if that's the case
but there's something very weird in this
story uh apparently
the there was a whistleblower
who came forward to the director of
national intelligence
we don't know the nature of the
whistleblowing maybe they do on the
intelligence committee
federal law mandates that this must be
reported to
congress and the information
there's a specific procedure to protect
whistleblowers
because if you don't let the air out of
that tire then you get a lot of leaks
the inspector general apparently of the
director of national intelligence
interviewed this whistleblower found
them credible at least
in a uh first blush perspective
but apparently the dna is dna has been
told by a
higher power
not to fulfill their federal
uh statutory obligations here is
um adam schiff on with margaret brennan
on
cbs face the nation this weekend you
issued a subpoena
on friday for the acting director of
intelligence
alleging he's withholding a
whistleblower disclosure
possibly to protect president trump
that's a pretty significant allegation
here we're putting up a quote on the
screen from you
have you gotten a response to this
letter we've gotten a response and the
director has said essentially that he is
answering to a higher authority
and refusing to turn over the
whistleblower complaint um
this is deeply troubling um
well at this point yes ignoring the
subpoena ignoring our
request no dni no director of national
intelligence has ever refused a turnover
whistleblower complaint and here
margaret
the significance is the inspector
general found this complaint to be
urgent
found it to be credible that is they did
some preliminary investigation found the
whistleblower
to be credible that suggests
corroboration
uh and that involved serious or flagrant
wrongdoing
and according to the director of
national intelligence the reason he's
not
acting to provide it even though the
statute mandates that he do so
is because he is being instructed not to
that this involved
a higher authority someone above the dni
well there are only a few people above
the dni
so we're concerned this area this
involves
wrongdoing that's under investigation by
our committee
and we're going to do everything
necessary to make sure that
whistleblower is
not allowed to provide the complaint to
us but can come directly to congress
which the
director is also prohibiting at this
point
i order you not to hand over the
whistleblower
i mean it's only because we're of the
left that we don't contemplate that it
could be god who did this
and everybody's like this is probably
donald trump it could be god
could be god you leave him alone
don't you let that pencil neck geek
shift
see the whistle blower adam shift adam
trying to undermine god so it could be
trump or maybe bar
uh i don't know where if barr would be
considered to be an authority over the
dni i just don't think he's in that flow
chart
i don't frankly know who would be in
that flow chart maybe the chief of staff
i don't know direct to the cia but maybe
people
i don't know i do not know what
constitutes a higher authority maybe we
should have somebody on that but i i for
one would be very interested in hearing
that whistleblower nobody knows who the
authority is
ivanka
nobody knows nobody knows just like we
don't know
good job it's so funny general mattis
said it's better
to have cigarettes and a beer and then
this woman who looks like a librarian
comes along
and she says pull their toenails off
it's tough stuff
tough stuff but the stuff that he's
outlining there
like it could be um they saw
a an abuse on uh some type of like um
spying program right i mean it could i
mean certainly whistleblowers have been
ignored in the past although
a guy like thomas drake actually went to
congress um
and um they found his claims credible
it's hard to know what it is that
someone outside of the dna
and i would be uh quashing at this point
i just have to say the fact that trump
called him you know
adam's really was one of his better
pieces of work
and the fact that he also managed to
write in the tweet
d california good work that was good
work
got him
maybe it was the same higher 30 that
told all those bahama gang members they
couldn't get on the boat
higher authority it's a higher 30s i got
about a paragraph through that hit lip
book
that's what i got for a bit caller from
a 512 area code who's this where you
call him from
hey this is susan noah's mom in austin
susan noah the intern's mom how are you
susan
i'm well i'm well i think he's trying to
get in touch with you guys he's at
nyu now so kind of exciting he
but should i just had three quick
things i wanted to throw out to the
libertarians about the
fifteen dollar minimum wage this is just
this argument always makes me nuts but
three things so
my mom and real quick my mom's family on
her side lives in norway they're from
norway and then we travel
back and forth to europe quite a bit so
i remember
in the springtime mom and i went to
wales and we were just going to look at
some castles and there was a lovely lady
we pulled up our car and parked
and she had her uniform on she was
really friendly and helpful
and i looked at mom and said you know
what a nice
life for her to be able to live in this
small town take care of it you know
take care of the treasure that's here in
their town to share with the world
and she makes a living wage she can go
home
and you know have dinner at night with
her family and probably
you know put her kids through school or
whatever but it's like and that's the
same in norway
um you know if you want to work at the
grocery store you can
if you want to flip burgers for the rest
of your life
why shouldn't you be able to do that who
is you know why does everybody have to
be
aspiring to be a billionaire that's just
ridiculous so that number one makes me
crazy it's like people should be able to
pick the job that they want to do and
i'll be punished
and expected to live at some
i don't know expected lifestyle number
two as a public school teacher
i'm going to tell you right now that
market forces failed me because
there's no way in the world that any
teachers getting paid what they're worth
and i imagine police officers and nurses
and firemen feel the same way
and lastly when he was talking about
malibu last week
one of my oldest childhood friends is a
ski instructor in aspen
she's been there for years the only way
she can live there
well now her situation's better because
she's inherited so many from parents but
um aspen the average cost of living for
a home there is like seven
million dollars right and that is a city
i imagine malibu is
the same way i've never been there but
it's largely
it relies a lot on the service industry
and if they don't
if the city doesn't subsidize housing
for people who work at the grocery
stores or at the ski resort or whatever
then there's nobody to work in this job
and if they have to live
outside of aspen it's difficult to get
there they couldn't afford to come in
and out of town to serve all those rich
peoples i mean it's like
but it's just ridiculous the whole thing
that you don't want somebody to be able
to live where they're born or live where
they want to live
and be able to you know they don't have
to have a mansion in
malibu or aspen but they ought to be
able to live there
and work and not be punished that's not
a bad decision my friend wanted to be a
ski instructor that's not a bad decision
that was
her life's happiness anyway that kind of
stuff just makes me crazy and i wanted
to
when i was listening to that
conversation between you and the
libertarian my head was about to explode
so that's it well um uh susan i
appreciate the call
and um it's a good point there's no well
why can't people live you know just work
a job
that it something they enjoy doing
it pays a uh enough so that you can have
a
a reasonably comfortable life without
having to
oh wait i'm sorry question uh
phone line's a little bad i'm sorry uh
why doesn't your friend just move to the
berkshires
uh there's smaller mountains i guess but
if she wasn't in a strong enough
position to
buy a house in aspen i just don't feel
as if i should need to pay for that
i mean you're laughing but it's a point
thank you bye-bye
like we should just ohio actually tell
you what she's been doing
nationalize aspen hell yeah call from
603 you know i agree with that call from
603 area code who's this where are you
calling from
hi it's john from houston i'm kidding
but
i had a comment about your dr box
interview
last week my doctor what
buck oh oh oh okay yeah dave roberts
okay yeah it's it's it's not dr vox yeah
yeah yeah
okay is it not no he's
dave roberts at vox
yeah right anyway anyways okay oh
i'm sorry i have to go ha ha
what
was that a uh prank phone call
call from a three one zero real tears to
things
real tears so as an example where
libertarians might have a point is chris
james maybe should get paid for that
you shouldn't hi
hi who's this uh this is lauren ventura
hi lauren what's on your mind can you
hear me yes i can
well i was okay good i was calling as a
follow-up to my
previous call i don't know a couple
months ago about
um oh gosh what i even called that um
like getting medical care like i'm a
chronic pain patient because of uh
serious health concerns and your uh
segment today about the opioid crisis
it's really it's a really difficult
um it's a really difficult topic i mean
for me it's really frustrating for me
and a number of other chronic pain
patients it's like
we've all been through the ringer of
every type i have tried
every type of pain management option and
like my only
the only thing that helps me a little
bit is opioids and for them to be so
stigmatized it really
it hampers our sorry i'm walking so i'm
a little out of breath
um it hampers our ability to get the
care we need
right and um so it's like it's it's
frustrating because it's like i do know
that there is a problem of over
prescription
in some instances but it's like
there's always there's two sides to
every coin because
because it's such like a national thing
that it's like
it's this epidemic proportion problem
then it's like people like me there are
lots of people in the chronic pain
uh community that um
that it's like we are not allowed to get
care like for example i it's been four
years that i've been in pain since
having a brain hemorrhage in 2015
and it took me three and a half years
for any doctor to be willing to
prescribe me anything that actually
helped with pain
which was opioids i tried every single
like
every single medication that's possible
i tried spinal cord stimulators i tried
like
chiropractic i tried like all these like
stupid things again that you know that
don't help at all
that doctors were telling me i had to
use and um
and and yet you know i still i'm still
in this position of where it's like
i i understand that it's like it's a
personal problem that i feel attacked by
it but it's frustrating because every
time i see my pain management doctor
um he's like i had been referred to him
from my previous pain management doctor
who tried every trick he had nothing
helped me
and like um it's like he always
laments how like every time i go to the
pharmacy the pharmacist
like interrogate me because i'm young
and they think i'm just like
drug seeking and it's like okay sorry
people who are like in their 20s and 30s
have pain too like you don't know what
happened to us you know
um so i don't know that's just sort of
like
my soapbox listen i i um
i i i feel badly for you i totally
understand the
the um the dynamic you're talking about
and in some respects it is frankly
it is you know part of what should be
considered in the uh you know
in in holding these companies to account
because not only did they create an
epidemic of epic proportions killing
tens of thousands of people
annually and they also
made it difficult for people who
genuinely
need to um who are appropriate
for this type of medication yeah exactly
you get it and if this is
this is part of i mean i don't know
i don't know what the solution is right
like i don't know like maybe
yeah no i i don't either that's the
first right well that's what it sounds
like it's like you realize like this is
a situation that ha
that is like one of those things that
are intractable and like this ends up
being
you know part of the suffering is not
just in those people
who shouldn't have been on that
medication or over-prescribed it but
part of the suffering is people who do
need that medication
and now have more trouble getting access
to it because
society has to overcompensate for the
problems that were created
by this company going around saying this
stuff is not addictive
and um yeah i i my heart goes out to you
and um i mean i i
i i don't i you know i hope that there
ends up being something that they find
um
that will you know it isn't as
scrutinized as much
as as opioids are at this point that
will give you some
you know some measure of relief my heart
goes out to you i'm sorry about this
yeah no it's um well you know the thing
that i'm on the waiting list for right
now that's like pretty pretty insane i
can't believe like you know five years
ago i would have never thought i'm doing
this but i'm gonna get ketamine
infusions which is this like
insane where i'll have to go for like
weeks on end to be infused with ketamine
but i would just like to say one other
little
factoid about my specific plight right
now that i just learned that there was
an article
um in uh what some some like normal
newspaper gosh what was it um an article
in
um gosh in the guardians uh just
a few days ago that that talked about
how women
weren't included in clinical trials for
drugs
until the 1990s so like during my
lifetime
and despite the fact that we make up 70
of chronic pain patients
80 of pain medication has only been
tested on men
so people like me are just like really
sort of up the creek without a paddle
um i don't you know i don't expect any
necessary you know any response
from you on this that could because it
can you know have any meaning but i just
wanted to draw people's attention to
this issue
because it's obviously something near
and dear to my heart since it is you
know my life
oh yeah yeah there's also a lot of bias
in how pain is treated
uh against women and people of color um
i
i saw some statistics once where like
women are more likely to be treated for
anxiety
and men are more likely to be believed
about their pain
and that sounds about right
yeah no that was that's been my
experience too even like decades ago
when i had
anxiety um i i was having chest pains
and i went in for my chest pains
and they were just like there's nothing
wrong with you like and it's like it was
clearly that i had anxiety but they
wouldn't even tell me
that i was just like i was just left
there thinking that i was like still
gonna die
and and i realized that a lot it's like
i'm so lucky that i'm white but even so
i realize that there are instances where
like because i'm a woman
i'm talked down to especially by my male
doctors like i'm lucky now i have some
doctors that are like
around my age which is also horrifying
that now i'm that old the doctors are my
age but it's like they are more
sympathetic but these old
old white guy doctors man they just uh
they are not very uh sympathetic to
those who are not also old white guys
appreciate the call hang in there um you
know check back with us i'm sorry you're
going through this
thank you all right bye-bye
call from a 702 area code who's this
where you calling from
hey sam it's bro from engle from las
vegas bro flamingo
from las vegas what's on your mind
hey sam how are you doing today i'm
doing well i'm doing well how are you
excellent i'm all right um
i i just want to give you my take on the
some kind of uh
what happened during the debate um
i kind of feel like joe biden had his
worst night yeah
out of out of the whole time and i think
like saying you know because i'm kind of
glad i called later because you know we
kind of first watched it they kind of
digest everything
on the on like the next day you know i'm
saying you kind of you kind of want to
wait until
you can get through everything but um i
kind of felt like too julian
castro actually had probably had the
they
also i think one thing that was kind of
lost in the that's kind of lost in the
um
kind of conversation was uh how pretty
much julian castro pretty much kneecaps
booty judge
the rest of the night i mean when we
just tried to do the hey you know this
is why
you know middle america nobody really
likes watching it because
you shut up stupid okay it's a debate
right but let's let's get to it
so you know i had no idea that castro
was this like
ornery i i mean i i like it i i there's
nothing in his previous appearances i've
seen that would indicate it
absolutely also also mike to your point
actually i kind of like
julian castro now because to me he kind
of fulfilled de blasio's role was kind
of like the attack
dog i mean he's out there getting to it
so i really like that i'm here
i'm all here for it also uh also this um
i would say clover shark diy let's get
her off the stage
it's bad it's embarrassing um
you know i i think i think uh also
another thing too is that
i really think that kind of obviously
civility
politics died last night but that's kind
of truly on casual kneecap and booty
jake
on like the nonsense of like you know
guys we gotta be polite whatever
i think the next debate gonna be much
much better um also i've
also you know the record player the
record player thing sam it's easy to
talk about that but there's another one
i want to talk about
was i mean well okay look trump can do
this all the time but it was just
stunning to watch biden do this
not only was he lying about the iraq war
answer it was incoherent
at the same time it was just crazy yeah
you know people people who are my age
remember
that joe biden was one of he was not
along for the ride
joe biden was out there basically
corralling the buses
and getting people on board and
you know he was a senate armed services
and i think he
i think he wanted to have
i think he was one of those guys who
wanted to have a
an independent kurdish state and so i
think he thought this was a root to that
on some level and i'm not sure what was
behind that well he was even worse he
wanted to i mean
by the way let me be clear i do support
a kurdish state but his whole big thing
was he wanted to
split iraq into three parts three parts
the arrogance
right the presupposition of that and um
there was some you know uh notion that
this would i i don't know what the
theory
it was behind that per se but um
he yeah he was pretty gung-ho for this
war and i think
um it certainly was one of those
situations where it's like and it's the
same thing you see it from chris coons
in this instance too it's like here's
what we're going to do
i'm going to set a condition upon i'm
going to make my support for this war
conditioned
upon a conclusion by people who i should
not
trust and but it sounds reasonable
i'm not going to say i'm for war i'm
going to set it on a condition that
sounds reasonable except for everybody
knows you should not trust those people
and that they have an agenda and that's
the way they do this
that's the way they sound reasonable
that's the way that we get
led into war and then everybody says you
got to talk to the generals and you got
to talk to
well what if the generals say uh this is
not so
but then we'll find different generals
you got to talk to the intelligence
people
well what if the intelligence people say
actually it's not so clear
we'll get different intelligence people
we know how this
works um and so for someone like chris
coons to go on and say something like
that joe biden was one of those guys but
really in many ways more so because he
was
i think a leader of the senate armed
services and was
um was very what
was very hawkish it seemed to me but
right
also also saying i'll say two quick
things don't jump because i also also
wanted jamie i want jamie to take on
something real quick but the second
thing was too sam
just you know it was weird because it
was almost like joe biden was in reverse
in a sense because like on the on the
record player answer they peed that
question up for him
and he could knock out the park and they
could have moved on yeah just completely
bombed and then
and the thing about the iraq war thing
was uh why'd you even bring that up
that was just weird to be like why even
bring that i mean it's kind of it's kind
of baked into the cake already you
should even mentioned it
and the last thing i'll say because i
kind of want jamie's opinion also your
guys depends on on this dude then i'll
jump it's just
the kavanaugh thing is coming back of
course we knew we'll come back okay you
know
the rapists the thieves the thugs
the trash but you know but the thing is
though there's a through line here
because i i just i just kind of kind of
put it all together
joe biden bill clinton kavanagh
donald trump and a lot of a lot of the
trash and the detritus
you guys all the same person when it
comes to women and massage means some of
these fascists can't
they can't apologize if they can't own
up to it
and i also and i was reading in the in
the new york times comment section uh it
was a charles blow
flamingo if you got if you got a
question you want us all to answer you
got to get to it man we gotta get we
gonna move oh sorry sorry
i don't know i just want you guys
opinion because i just feel like i just
feel like honestly at the end of the day
look there's this thing about women and
these guys going just going
nuts about you know raping women all the
time you know all these guys had
all the women problems stuff these guys
are all pretty much all the same guys
sam
that's the way i see it donald trump joe
biden bill clinton and all these guys
you know
all that i like james opinion john
thanks guys thanks for my call
okay thanks i appreciate the call good
jimmy yeah i mean there are certainly
matters of degree
but you can see a certain through line
between
all of these sexist men who are also
arguably misogynistic and in the
policies that they support
um i mean i knew i felt it in my bones
the kavanaugh was getting on there
and i couldn't totally explain why on a
logical level
other than the fact that i know that
this country
and this society absolutely does not
care about survivors of sexual assault
i haven't really talked about it on the
show before but i am a survivor of
sexual assault and
i just i knew i just knew like i know i
like to do the wide angle thing
and say i i can tell what social forces
are uh are arraying against us but
that is definitely one of them
um i i think the the point of like all
these guys being the same guy i mean i
think you have a certain attitude
towards the world
and um
part of that is obviously like your
superiority to
women right i mean i think you have that
attitude towards
a large segment of the population
but um but particularly
in uh john ronson's the psychopath test
he argues that that
is a trait that actually might help you
raise rise up the ranks in certain like
corporate america situations and there's
al
obviously other traits that are you know
less severe than psychopathy but like
just sort of
misogyny and basically just not caring
about other people exactly
if you have that perspective on women
there's 50
of the people on day one that you don't
have to give a about
as you trample through the broad forward
right like
and then you then you just you could
just keep layering sets of
people like i don't have to think about
that like that dude over there i gotta
contemplate like wait where is he going
am i is he possible straight
but the rest i could just go whoop well
but even the broader
uh implications for things there's
actually these really
vivid lines that christopher hitchens
did really ham up though of like
talking about bill clinton and dick
morris just like
indulging themselves in the most
grotesque ways while like
signing welfare reform legislation and
like terrorizing poor people with
work requirements and lectures on their
morality and this type of thing so
i i think bro flamingos onto something
yeah it's also evident in how they treat
people of color
right which is so condescending and like
they should be grateful for any
attention given to them by
joe biden like give me a break um
speaking of biden i don't want to play
the corn pop thing i don't care
honestly like he's got a story i
remember i was in worcester
and there was somebody named corn pop i
mean
i was at the swimming pool and i was an
assistant lifeguard i was the only
lifeguard because i had asthma but i was
there this is not that
he did this in 2017 right as it was when
he was there
because i don't think he could deliver
that story today
i'm not being i'm not i'm not i don't
mean to be a jerk
i'm not being cute when i saw that i was
like well at least he's got some energy
he seems maybe he gets more energized
when he's talking about the old days
but i don't think he could deliver that
same story today
and cornbread just play a little more
play a little don't give it to me
play a little bit about because i
honestly like the look
this corn pop story i i think it's true
um i think it's his way of showing like
i'm a tough guy
i'm tough but i'm fair and you know this
is it
you know and he was at the the pool and
so he's just recalling his days at the
pool like i'm regular joe
corn pop i had chains um
but yeah this is you know did you hear
the whole thing
and but but here's the thing i don't
think joe biden today could tell this
story like this go
i learned a lot and i learned that uh
it makes a difference this was the
diving board area
and i was one of the guards and they
weren't allowed it was a three meter
board
and you fell off sideways you landed on
the damn the darn cement
over there and corn pop was a bad
dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys
and i did yeah he and back in those days
things have changed
one of the things you had to use if you
use pomade in your hair you had to wear
a bathing cap
and so he was up on the board one
listening i said hey esther
you off the board i'll come up and drag
you off
so basically what what he's showing is
that like he was a tough guy
he was a tough guy what was it
brandon said like little richard up
there oh yeah this story also
highlights the fact that he's a million
years old yes that's my point like the
pomade comment you're like wait what and
he calls them they were greasers now i
think he's referring to esther
williamson or something like that who
was
a they used to do um
water ballet movies yeah i had a little
oh that was
awesome he was really telling corn
popped like yo
yeah hey esther oh that's awesome you
know what i'm going to vote
he says i shouldn't have called you
esther but i still need to follow the
rules
now i don't like i don't think the story
endorsement retract i just think the the
i just think that
the the real main problem with the story
aside from the fact that like
he's really hanging on to this this is
from two years ago
i honestly don't think that joe biden
could tell a story that is six minutes
long today
and have it be relatively coherent i
mean is there is there footage of him
talking
not on a speech on something it's
written in front of
them but retelling recounting something
and be able to sort of follow it through
with that narrative i mean i'm not being
facetious here i just haven't seen it
and in the context of the debate i've
seen this guy debate
plenty of times before you see him in
these debates and his answer about um
in terms of reparations was all over the
place
do you ever find out why they ended the
debate 15 minutes early
i think people just got bored or maybe
they just schedule it like it was
supposed to be that long and so that
they could
you know that they'd get more some ad
time afterwards because they probably
have a higher ad
density in the last half hour and they
probably want to keep it in prime time
that's my guess um
so that's uh what joe biden had for us
uh this week
corn pop and it turns out corn pop is
real by the way
i was just reading an article oh i
believe it i believe i'm sure it's real
um there's there's i don't think there's
any reason to doubt that it's real
um i think to me the most telling part
is that like
he's talking about how all you know like
how
his perspective has changed on things
and the only thing that he comes up with
what's
old about that story is the pomade
needing a um a bathing cap
i only wish corn pop were still alive
today to comment
maybe he is he's not oh
corn pops family um so bernie sanders
has come out and we'll we'll talk more
about the details on this
uh in a day or two but
uh bernie sanders has come out with a
affordable housing plan that involves
rent control
across the country also involves
significant funding to upgrade
existing public housing
um money to support housing across the
board
and what this is going to do is it's
going to shore up
neighborhoods neighborhoods that are in
decline neighborhoods that are
subject to gentrification
and allow people to actually live in
nice neighborhoods
without having to come in you know
without having it
you know stay in their neighborhoods be
able to live
in neighborhoods that are improving and
enjoy the fact
that they have like invested their lives
in these neighborhoods
uh here's bernie sanders to living that
speech on housing
it is not acceptable to me that wealthy
and powerful real estate developers
in nevada and throughout this country
and i've seen this all over america
are gentrifying neighborhoods and
forcing
working-class families out of their
homes
and apartments that they have lived in
for decades and forcing them out
and replacing that housing that
affordable housing
with fancy condos and luxurious homes
that only the very wealthy can afford
that is not acceptable
we're going to stand up to
gentrification
now there he is he had a lozenge uh that
he
ejected um the
um the issue that we have now
in the wake of the the housing crisis or
the financial crisis i should say that
was brought about
by by an inflated housing bubble
is that you have so many foreclosed
homes around the country that ended up
getting bought
by huge hedge funds
that were not in the business of being
landlords
and they bought up all these houses at a
huge discount obviously
fire sales literally almost in some
instances
and uh they're crappy landlords
uh or they're going in with specifics
and
uh specific places and getting the best
of the properties
and uh doing tear-downs and then
building up
um like bernie said much more expensive
housing
and it's a problem
it's it's causing people to
move further and further out it's
causing it's miserating people it's
keeping people from living in decent um
neighborhoods it's uh i would imagine
also adding to the segregation of
schools in many respects
um when was the last time we had a
presidential candidate talked about
housing
well honestly yeah sam stein also gives
a lot of good background
um in his book and on this very show and
on my show
about why the economy has developed
in this way at this particular time to
be so heavily reliant on real estate
um it's uh
it's a problem but uh here's bernie you
know
again expanding the terrain in which
the the candidates have to address
policy failures
but there's two sides to every coin
bernie sanders of course was hoarse
during the um
the last debate and
um some people watch that
i'm talking about clip number ten
and some people you know some
some pundits some voters they don't want
somebody who
is in any way aggressive or any way
fighting
uh they want someone who is like
visually appealing
and you know good-looking soft-spoken
reasonable guy and some people
particularly like i guess when bernie's
voice was a little raspy
maybe they could look at bernie and
think like oh his voice is raspy he's
he's elevating his volume he seems
angry now i don't think most people that
but if you're sensitive
if you're one of those people who thinks
that like you know i want my politician
to be good looking and
and and just sort of um and and not
confrontational bernie's a snack
yeah well some people disagree like for
instance
this excuse for a human being
who um was relentlessly
mocking teachers who were his
constituents
of course flamed out after his um
his attempt to punish uh people
politically by
causing traffic jams going on to the
george washington bridge
i'm of course talking about the ace abc
pundit
chris christie quite frankly sanders to
me
looked unglued well he was also having
some trouble with this road that night
he was but
but it's not just his throat george i
mean his eyes were bulging out of his
head
visually i can tell you because i i was
watching it on tv
he looked disturbing to me that he
really looked angry
and i don't think that democratic
primary voters
want angry i think they want effective
they want somebody with fire in the
belly
he's a passionate politician who brings
his emotions to the table i thought he
did an effective job and
yeah wow what they want is a morbidly
obese corrupt
who terrorizes teachers in between
stuffing his face and literally
chased a teacher down the boardwalk with
a melting ice cream cone in his hand
that's the kind of integrity and
stability that they want
and it's cool because then you still get
rewarded with a tv kick even though
you're a national embarrassment
and left with record on high on approval
ratings and we're an early endorser of
donald trump which is
also speaking of stability and emotional
health
i you know what i would like to see like
as someone like a host like a george
stephanopoulos at that time or maybe one
of the other panelists like
what makes you like what gives you this
insight into what democratic voters want
i mean i mean non-shout out all the
polling
we know there's three top candidates in
the democratic primary right now
is there one who has not expressed anger
of one sort or another
i mean honestly you know biden's been
a little bit more sort of focused on
trump
but it and warren and bernie's like i
mean to what extent
who in the democratic party represents
the non-angry like
is not trying to express some measure
rank leads is it klobuchar
oh that's pete but a judge that's who it
is it's people to judge
who is pulling it around what like three
percent
is it three percent i mean i'd just be
curious if a pundit is gonna say this
stuff you gotta let people like
respond to it not just on the question
of like
chris christie's perspective that bernie
sanders is out of control
i mean the basic premise of what he's
trying to argue is to like
maybe that's what people want never mind
does he know who won the last time
around exactly
and and who didn't win um
here is a pete buddha judge
and he is coming out he's basically
like trying to i don't know
i don't i'm trying to think like maybe
he's thinking like vp
of one of these people like i just don't
know what his what what he thinks he's
he's doing here where he's positioning
himself for
um maybe it's to run for governor maybe
he's decided like
i don't know um but
people to judge um he
thinks that what we can do is return to
a time that really basically never was
as the youngest candidate in the field i
am obviously a believer in the power of
generational change
i also believe that a candidate at any
age depending who they
are can be a great president what we've
got to talk about right now
is vision my concern about the vision
from the sanders warren approach
is that it can polarize americans when
we have other ways to deliver bold
solutions without dividing the american
people further
my difference with the vice president is
that i also don't think
promising pause it for one second i want
you to talk about this idea of
polarization
like it's almost as if people don't
understand what the word means
like we're polarized this country is as
polarized
as it could be the idea that in some
fashion
the democrats have the ability to walk
like i guess the only thing he's saying
is that like look here's the center
right and here uh here are the
conservatives
and they're way out here and democrats
have been here
and if we get uh warren or sanders we're
gonna be here and that's going to
increase the polarization i get news for
you
there's nothing pete buddha judge is
going to do
that is going to in any way diminish the
because we have seen
for the past 25 years that if the
democrats move
this way the republicans move that way
they go further their the spectrum in
america is pretty
is pretty standard the the the outer
margins
maybe who fills them isn't she you know
but the the uh the parameters
of what we have in this country are
pretty well set even our left
is not that left and the right side
doesn't even fit in the screen
and well that's right and and so the
bottom line is
he is basically just saying we need to
return
to the time that got us to where we are
today
so that we can do this again
but let's hear his critique of joe biden
who is also making that same pitch
though but apparently he's doing it with
maybe his teeth falling on his eyes
bleeding
letting the american people further my
difference with the vice president is
that
i also don't think promising that we're
going back to normal is going to be a
message that will hit
people well certainly where i come from
in the industrial midwest there are
a lot of people who voted for this
current president not because they think
he's a good guy
but because normal wasn't working for
them and they were ready to
more or less vote to burn the house down
if all we have to offer
is hey let's let's dial it back and go
back to what we were doing if it feels
like we're
looking to the past i think that message
is going to come up short
when we get to election day so he's
basically saying
i've got a third secret way alfred
e newman i mean which is just
mwah but i think that you know yeah but
literally it is a third secret way he's
doing
the third way for 2019 and he's just
saying joe biden's third way is 1980s
third way
my third way is 2019 third way i think
it's also
it's really interesting too because
bernie actually
is attempting on some level to say and i
think this argument even if it can't
reach a lot of people
can reach some and it needs to be made
or else we're not going to survive right
he's saying like look
we need to get back there does need to
be a polarization right between the 99
the 1 between workers and capital or
whatever
so he is attempting to at least make a
grounded version of that argument an
argument that has some
semblance of of reality if you read
pete's book he's doing a lot of and
again it's
pure clintonism he's doing you know i
what's the famous line what's the uh
discriminatory fast food chain he has
this famous line where he's
chick-fil-a yeah i don't like their
politics but i'm quite partial to their
chicken
of course that's his whole shtick is
not acknowledging the reality of the
polarization and thinking a bunch of
like
cheap cultural signifiers or do
something not actually building people
together in an actual coalition to do
something in the real world which is why
of course he hasn't said anything about
the uaw walkouts or anything
he's trash um we will get to uh
these um uh uaw walkouts um
tomorrow but just to give you a little
bit more information
as of i guess it was 11 50 59 p.m last
night as opposed to 12 a.m this morning
50 000 uaw workers uh
in facilities from michigan to texas
um are participating um
it's a contract negotiation wages health
care benefits temporary workers job
scare
security profit sharing um
and um you have 200 local union leaders
voted unanimously to support the strike
back in 2007 which the last time we had
a uh
strike of of this uh type
uh uaw called for work stoppage costs
general moore's more than 600 million
dollars
uh so
we'll see see how long it takes for um
for general motors uh to uh give him but
it's nice to see more
more labor action hell yeah
and so far bernie is only feeding back
into the movement which is
super important uh let's go to the
phones
call them from a six zero
seven six zero area code who's this
where you calling from
hey sam this is amy from san diego amy
from san diego what's on your mind
um so i called into david paxman show
last week and i asked him about um
if bernie would commute or pardon edward
snowden and at the beginning of the show
i know you talked about edward so
i just kind of wanted to get your
thoughts on that i don't know
i i mean i have no ideas on that i mean
i
i imagine um my my guess would be
i mean if snowden's just simply saying
like i want to i want to be assured a
free
a fair trial which i think is not um
it's not i don't think it's something
you can take for granted frankly
um but i it's conceivable to me that um
the sanders would um if anything it may
be
under those in that context have him
back i mean do
something to create some type of
scenario where the trial would be
um uh where he would have
you know more of an opportunity to sort
of say like you know here's what i
revealed
uh here's the cost at which it was done
and
here is the benefit in terms of you know
it being a genuine
whistleblower action i mean um
it uncovered
criminal wrongdoing in my estimation uh
of what the nsa and and what different
spying
um uh services we're doing you know
contrary to statute
in this country and uh that to me is
what a whistleblower does
and no one's been able to establish you
know the destruction of any uh
spy networks we kept hearing that this
supposedly put people's lives in danger
uh but we never heard any even
second-hand evidence of that and i
imagine that's because there wasn't
but um i i don't have a sense of what uh
sanders would do
about that to be honest with you i would
support him pardoning snowden
i'll say that i'd be in favor
i think we'd all support that right yeah
i certainly would support that
without a doubt my guess would be i have
no clue but my guess would be is that
this is something that could
maybe be put in play i wouldn't bank on
it but
you know that's the type of thing where
maybe it could be put and play with them
all the rest of them
no way appreciate the call
calling from a 510 area code who's this
where you calling from
510 510 510
bye bye
column from a9 0
area code 91901
hello hello yes
oh my god bro i can't believe i got all

memphis i've moved to texas in 2017. i
love you guys
just found y'all in uh january this year
and man
i love y'all's show like y'all
are so intelligent i love
watching y'all but
mainly i want to call about uh uh pretty
much like
it's really sad what we're seeing with
iran it's
like i love foreign policy is basically
i study political science in college i'm
21
and uh i love history it's my uh area of
interest and
this year we're doing with iran is
ridiculous like i had a conversation
with a friend on instagram uh
not long ago like with the drone strikes
that the drone strike that happened and
i put uh no war with iran immediately he
respond he's a right-winger
and he uh voted for trump and he
immediately responds uh they
shoot down a drone and we shouldn't do
anything i'm like bro do you not know
the history of like what we've done
1953 overthrowing the like uh supporting
the coup and all this stuff like
they just completely ignore history just
completely like it's ridiculous i love
the calls you have
with libertarians and stuff it's so like
you know just basically pointing out the
fantasies and stuff
and uh last thing i want to say uh matt
you're a brewers fan aren't you
uh no i'd probably say i'm a twins fan
but i basically hop around
okay okay i thought you were a brewers
fan man that's sad about uh
my boy yellings man i love uh i love
baseball i love
y'all cody's man that's all i
wanted to say well radel thank you so
much i appreciate the phone call
yeah the um well and it's it's also look
we had a deal with iran that uh i
appreciate the call we had a deal with
iran
that took nukes off the table
so that you could sit down with them
with the knowledge frankly like look
that gives us a certain amount of
leverage doesn't give us total leverage
but it gives a certain amount of
leverage
the idea that like we've already agreed
no nukes you're getting this money and
then the question is
you know how do we uh leverage use that
leverage
to bring them further into the
international community so
that these regional fights they have but
part of that also
deals with basically um
not giving saudi arabia every single
thing it wants
but they and i mean they are in the
international community i mean that's
the thing about iran
like and and this has nothing to do with
just you know set aside if you're
talking about any of these countries
including the united states there's
plenty of human rights violations and so
on but
they have deep relationships with russia
with china they have good relationships
with the europeans increasingly they
were building partnerships in latin
america
it it just looks absurd
you know on every single level like they
have been pretty broadly integrated into
the international system and that right
now you have like a situation where
you know libya wasn't a deal but gaddafi
dismantled his program
and then we destroyed him
you know celebrated people sodomizing
and murdering him on the streets
rubio just tweeted that out as a threat
to maduro and then we
scrapped this deal which there's not a
single person that questions whether or
not they were following it
no there was no doubt whatsoever and you
know
best case scenario at this point is that
we get another deal that is
like the last deal except for we just
call it trump's deal
and a war with iran would be so much
worse than the war in iraq
yes without a doubt come from a 518 area
code who's this where you calling from
hello hello
hey uh this is arthur calling from
vietnam
arthur from vietnam what's on your mind
arthur
uh well i'm just you know being here in
vietnam i had some
observations i wanted to share uh
specifically about
socialism um
so i just think it's
it's funny how how much america
fears socialism uh especially when it
comes to health care
and yet like i i've come to realize in
asking um
vietnamese friends here that if you
don't have money or
health insurance here you will die if
you go to the hospital
like you know it's just you're free to
die as uh
as you are in america um
yeah and that was mostly that was mostly
just a little tidbit that i had the
other thing
uh just a small rant about how much
centrism
pisses me off sure um
yeah since i've been thinking about it
and i just i don't understand
what what centrism really can mean
like in the context of racism or
abortion like how can you be
centrist on an issue like that like it's
it just doesn't make any sense and
whether whether you like when a centrist
is in power
they you know for example like obama
you end up with republicans
kind of fearing things their way and
then
even worse is after obama you end up
with somebody like trump so i
i just it's just a it's a very
detrimental position to take i think
well it's i mean you know at the very
least and it's sort of like what we were
talking about with buddha judge's
argument i mean the bottom line is uh
you're negotiating against yourself
you know there is um this idea
and and it's also you know the question
is to what constitutes um
centrism i guess i mean if they want to
call it centrism but the the fact of the
matter is is that if you measure it
based upon
issue sets as to what the american
public expresses that they want
they're not really centrists tend to be
to the right of the american public and
so
um you know just in i don't know how
else you could determine it and just in
terms of sheer numbers but it there's
it really is what we should use instead
of centrism is really more just like
establishment
and and sort of status quo corporate
apologists
yeah exactly well listen right
economically and center left on
social issues when they don't compromise
them away
appreciate the call right thanks yep
all right folks that's it for today see
you
[Music]
all the tomorrow i got to get to
where i want but i know
somehow i'm gonna get there
i wasn't looking
[Music]
