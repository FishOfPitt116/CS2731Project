Donald Trump was out in um in Michigan
last night uh very excited that
um he's not going to be indicted uh for
for uh coordinating with the Russians
um who
were involved in
the campaign at least according to the
bar memo
um and
um
here he is talking about
um what is this clip here this is the uh
the supporters outside being very
excited for the Q Anon uh oh well let's
first I want to see uh Donald Trump uh
feeling very excited uh so what does he
do he translates this excitement into
um a an attack on people who are
escaping intense violence
in their country uh and the people who
represent them in their right to seek
Asylum under U.S law Witnesses of
amnesty amnesty
you have people coming up you know
they're all met by the lawyers the
lawyers of
and they come out they're all met by the
lawyers and they say say the following
phrase I am very afraid for my life I am
afraid for my life okay and then I look
at the guy he looks like he just got out
of the ring he's the heavyweight
champion of the world he's a French
president
it's a big fat con job folks it's a big
fat con job
well how Despicable of a human being do
you have to be we just talked about the
other day uh reports from El Salvador
that policemen were fleeing the country
because they were afraid of the violence
and they cut the domestic violence
exceptionally they cut the domestic
violence exception they cut the
um uh there was one more exception it
escapes me at the moment but they've cut
these not exceptions but rather factors
uh for which someone could uh apply for
Asylum I mean this is how
despicable how low can you go here
um
the number of Asylum Seekers who
actually get Asylum I think is somewhere
around like 20 or 30 percent maybe not
even that High and
um people travel they put themselves at
enormous risk uh
to come up to the Border because they
are terrified
well this is his light Motif though and
he's always going to return to that no
matter what and he's probably feeling a
little bit happy right now he's back on
his
