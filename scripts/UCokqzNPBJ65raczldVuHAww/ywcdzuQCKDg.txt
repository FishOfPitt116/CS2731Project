hello friends it's your midweek
chapo coming a little bit later in the
week than usual but
i hope you can forgive us so uh better
[ __ ] forgive us
get over it
[Laughter]
you are disgusting [ __ ] hogs if you
look at it proportionally
about two percent of you showed up in
chicago for our two shows
[ __ ] you that you would even try to make
demands die
guys guys this week is all about
solidarity okay
we've got solidarity against our
listeners
let's uh do the roll call it's me will
meneker joining me this week
felix speederman hello everyone matt
chrisman
hi virgil texas hello how are you and
sitting in as our guest
our friend shuja hader shuja that's me
i'm glad to be back
well this week's episode uh you know i
feel like
we got a lot to talk about uh what's
been happening
and uh there's some there's some fire
that needs to be spit
and of course i'm talking about uh the
events that happened in charlottesville
over the weekend
uh we didn't get a chance to address
them and i think that's
probably good that we allowed for some
time for things to sort of cool down and
have people reflect but there is
obviously still
well we needed to wait to get uh the
president's reaction
just so that we could take our cues for
how to understand we're committed to
hearing from both sides before we make a
decision there's many sides yeah
yeah we don't want to put our chips down
right away exactly i was waiting for
scott adams's comments he's got a whole
side to him
i was i was i was getting ready we're
gonna spend the whole episode
just blasting donald trump for like
basically his open support of white
supremacy
but um he condemned all that so that's
true like he
clearly condemned uh the nazis and the
kkk
but also stood up for many of the fine
statue enthusiasts who were marching
along with them
and were attacked for no reason uh we're
joking but i mean what happened in
charlottesville was obviously uh
awful and unspeakable but
i guess like in looking back on it i i
want to talk about
you we're having you on because you
wrote an article that came out in
jacobin this week
um that happened like right right after
that this happened i remember was
talking to you about it uh over the
weekend
and you said uh you just like couldn't
sleep that night was it saturday night
it was saturday i was spending the whole
day just being [ __ ] online
in the worst way that i was tracking
every terrible thing that was going on
there's no good way to be online
but this you know there's no good way
but there's worse ways and this is one
of the worst
uh and just by the end of the day
couldn't sleep
thought about it all night woke up and i
wrote this piece
um that wasn't you know it wasn't just
about what had happened but it was about
the way
that people talked about what was
happening and the way that people were
talking about
uh the activists who showed up to face
the nazis
even before it had happened um and
some of the [ __ ] i recounted in this
article like started like
a couple of days beforehand uh when
people were already doing some many
sides [ __ ]
that donald trump picked right up on and
what was great about this article
is that you wrote it before donald
trump's
bizarre press conference at trump tower
where among other things
he used the phrase alt left
to describe uh you know the instigators
in his mind of violence in
charlottesville
which is brilliant on a number of levels
uh because like now
alt left has now become a term exactly
like fake news
in that i described it as passing
through the same human centipede
and the end of that human centipede is
just [ __ ] into
all of our mouths but like the people
who created the term alt left are
exactly the same people
who created the term fake news yeah is
that the resistance
yeah donald donald trump is like both in
shape and ability
like the nintendo character kirby
anything that the libs throw at him he
inhales
in his wide mouth while gesticulating
wildly
anything that anyone throws at him if he
goes to saudi arabia he becomes a
wahhabist if he talks to
hujin tao he's uh he believes in the
chinese method and it only just
inflates him yeah just like kirby and
when the liberals say
fake news alternative facts khafifi
alt he can deploy it with his tactical
mastery
of screaming uh through holes in his
brain at a press conference
and turn everything back around on them
okay i mean like we we should be clear
about like you know
what what happened though right which is
that okay
there is this huge you unite the right
rally which is this very
you know uh well-planned and
well-organized event
for them for yeah for them that was you
know put on by
neo-nazis white supremacists the
alt-right whatever the [ __ ]
you want to call proud boys i think a
few uh
three percenters those militia types
whatever i mean
this was like i said this was
unambiguously an open
organized display of fascism on the
streets of america
and there were counter protesters brave
people who wanted to stand up
against that and didn't you know wanted
to have some kind of
you know push back against this and
here's the thing
it turned violent and a woman was killed
when uh i'm sure as you all know one of
these [ __ ]
just drove a car into a crowd full of
people heather
a [ __ ] central casting fail son
yeah a guy who hits every [ __ ] check
mark
on who these [ __ ] are [ __ ]
washed out of the army couldn't hack
boot camp which now
in the 21st century is basically like
family double dare
they went back home to live with his mom
who he beat up because she tried to stop
him from
gaming all the time like these guys
always the response when you make these
jokes is wow very original it's like
it's impossible to not
talk about this because that's what you
[ __ ] are
you are people whose brains have been
broken by living in your parents [ __ ]
basement and not getting laid
and feeling like you should be in charge
of the world
and uh you know never getting blown by
uh
uh [ __ ] uh what the hell tomb raider
yeah there was a story somewhere that
said uh that that guy was widely known
as the nazi of his high school
it's like how long does it take people
to like figure this [ __ ] out they should
they should get rid of that position on
jv football teams
honestly yeah it's been long enough but
no yeah he was like if you were gonna
write a
moi dib character for like just
uh worthless lumps of nazi [ __ ] who
embody every characteristic
of their movement it would be this guy
he's chosen one and everyone's
likely to turn up at a nazi rally and
murder someone and here's the thing like
you know if you if you saw these images
of their like you know torchlit
parade or any of these [ __ ] in the
streets when any of like the fighting
was happening which included among other
things you know
like a gang of people just beating
someone with pipes in a parking garage
you know like it's easy to like you know
take notice or the guy who killed this
woman it's easy to take notice of how
sort of buffoonish and dorky and just
like dumb looking all these people
are but like i don't think that
necessarily precludes
how [ __ ] dangerous and scary it is
stupid
like it is ugly and idiotic in every way
and it sort of like relies on that
and it's like one necessarily doesn't
have to preclude the other
and the thing that like i think when we
talk about like the violence that
occurred here
and we're going to talk about like this
idea about like what both sides mean or
violence on both sides
i think we need to be very clear that
organized
demonstrations of fascism are
people announcing their intention to do
violence
it is violence these people are saying
they were chanting in the streets
the jew will not replace us and blood
and soil
these people are announcing their
intention to perform a genocide
in their community in america that is
their goal
that is what they believe in and that is
what they will tell to anyone who will
listen
and the more they do this [ __ ] and the
more organized and the more comfortable
they feel
marching in the streets the closer they
are to achieving that goal
so they're in my opinion there is no
such thing about violence on both sides
this rally was violence and any violence
that's done
in retaliation or against these people
is in my opinion completely justified
yeah and
the thing that we would sort of see
before this and i think like
everyone was kind of guilty about most
people were of
comparing these these people to like the
third reich and going well
you know they're these guys aren't
anything like the ndsap
before they came to power they're stupid
and lazy and slovenly and they failed at
everything and it's like
what do you think those guys were yeah
like they were they were all like
failed something or other who had to
drop out of cavalry school because they
got addicted to morphine and they
believed in magic
like that's not a preclusion to them
doing some incredibly [ __ ] up [ __ ]
himmler was a failed uh chicken farmer
which was the 1920s version of gaming
now now finally one of these [ __ ]
has just straight up murdered someone
and the person he uh killed uh
among injuring many other uh heather
hare
uh was there marching with the iww
and dsa and this is where we get into
how
[ __ ] unbearable it is and you know
almost perfect that trump used the
phrase alt left
to blame you know these people for
instigating violence or
participating in violence that is
morally equal to that of those carried
out by
neo-nazi fascists and what's so funny
about that and like we said it's that
it's
because it followed exact same pattern
of fake news
is that the same people not on the right
but on
like centrist liberals who have deployed
the phrase alt
left for about a year now to
slander and really obfuscate any
difference between themselves
and anyone further to their left is
both disgusting and hilarious because
all these people
look like absolute [ __ ] right now and
they are all
and all of them i'm not even going to
name their names at this point you guys
can say
if you want to you probably know who i'm
talking about
they are scrubbing their twitter
accounts fast right now for they're just
searching the term
alt left and deleting tweets because
they rightly understand how [ __ ] bad
they look
well you know it's the same [ __ ] that we
were talking about the last time i was
on
that the right has always been good at
looking at what like people in the
center and on the left are saying that
they can pick up
like identity politics for example and
then it was fake news
and now it's all left i mean uh it just
presents an opportunity
to you know strengthen their side and
these guys never
punch right whereas you know the kind of
mainstream
uh liberal democratic centrist people
are always punching to their left
and weakening our own side and like the
whole point of
the phrase alt left as it was invoked by
these people
it really in my opinion really goes back
to the never-ending
2016 primary between bernie sanders and
hillary clinton were these people
what the thing that one thing that they
could not allow to happen or not allow
themselves even to believe
is that the dispute between bernie
sanders supporters and hillary clinton
supporters broke down on basically a
normal
left-to-right spectrum in that bernie
sanders was clearly a candidate running
to the left of hillary clinton and his
supporters were to the left of hillary
clinton
and her policies they couldn't allow
that to be the case because then they
would have to
agree that they are fairly more
conservative than a broad swath of young
people
and the democratic party base so they
made the primary
into this [ __ ] thing about bernie
bros and racism and sexism supposedly on
the left
to create an equivalence between their
left-wing critics
represented by bernie sanders and his
supporters
and the alt-right and like and this idea
that they are
in subtle and obvious ways
equally racist and sexist because they
are attacking a woman and they are
misogynist or racist in the same way
or at least along the same in the same
avenue
as the alt-right yeah i mean sarah jones
and ryan cooper both wrote kind of
histories of this
that you saw at first like sean hannity
started saying all left all the time
uh and then it just got kind of picked
up
among you know uh joy reid and joan
walsh
and tom watson the usual suspects
um but then there was that article by
james walcott that i don't know if we
have up that we can look at
yeah you quote it in your article yeah
but but that
like the real thing that it did was that
it took that bernie bro
concept and just like linked it directly
like you know it used to be horseshoe
theory right
that right the left and the right end up
in the same general area it just brought
the ends together
and said actually they're exactly the
same uh
and and he says some wild [ __ ] in that
article i don't know if you have
no walcott uh says in the vanity fair
article he he uses the alt left
uh he's and bernie bro but he says he
says there is a kinship uh between the
far left and the white supremacists al
alt-right
and i'm you're paraphrasing him here but
you say they are united by
disillusionment with obama's presidency
loathing of hillary clinton and disgust
with identity politics
as well as a craving for a climatic
reckoning that will clear the stage for
a bold tomorrow
you know the way he ends that article is
with he says some i think literally the
sentence that it ends with
is go deep state go yes it's it's
i remember
[Laughter]
yeah i'm with him until the point about
the racketing what's the reckoning that
we want
revolution i guess i think yeah like we
liked it yeah it's it's it's insane
uh it's insane extremism to want to ever
change anything
right yes we live in the panglossian
best of all possible worlds
i mean that's the unstated assumption of
all of this is that
is that we live in this wig trajectory
towards
perfection that can't be disrupted with
any kind of
aggressive or uh intemperate action
is that that slow measure change will
always bring us to a better place
and that it's uh in any attempt to
change that trajectory through mass
action is inherently
uh extremist and illogical
and hateful somehow regardless of what
the goals are
by the way with james walcott i don't
know if you guys
saw this that a while back he wrote this
article that was something like
the best twitter feeds to follow to keep
up with the russia
uh connection or whatever and one of his
uh
like people who he cited as the best
sources was louise mensch
genius and he said i i the the exact
phrase he used was
was he said louise mensch is sherlock
holmes in
jet boots
i don't know what the [ __ ] that means
but it's like you're talking about
someone who said theodore herzl was an
anti-zionist yeah
you're talking about someone who thought
charlie hebdo was a guy yeah
that that is what sherlock holmes would
do if he was in rocket boots and didn't
know what time in history he was in he
was flying around
confused and terrified but uh watson
who's this guy charlie hebdo but
going back a little bit like this form
of liberalism
it's i mean it's the same thing we've
seen in liberalism in the contemporary
period but
it's more explicit in these past few
years that it seeks to completely
to completely change history to cut out
parts insert other parts
so that they are always on the left
they're always to the left of whatever
the crime bill now is now throughout
history
was supported by all black voters black
voters are now a monolith
russia did not fight the nazis uh
it's we're actually to the left of
sanders voters because of some
undefined policy goal we have to defeat
racism
our secret plan to defeat racism and
for a while like in that 2016 primary it
was funny
and it was like it was maddening at
times but it was
kind of like well this isn't an
immediate danger right now
that there are this group of people who
completely skew the world around them
but now it's become very apparent that
with so many threats
in front of us with the collapse of so
many of their institutions
that these people cannot be trusted to
do a [ __ ] thing
and a lot of them like a lot of the
people we were talking about who were
not naming
who did that alt left [ __ ] you know they
still fell back on it they said some
disgusting [ __ ]
you know don't [ __ ] don't even
[ __ ] screen cap them don't [ __ ]
think of them
don't talk about them let their [ __ ]
kids not even know who their name was
like captain vidal
[ __ ] them but the ones in power it is
more essential than ever that they are
[ __ ] out of there and
again like and part of this slander was
the idea that the
the alt left quote you know or bernie
the alt left to whatever to
whoever is criticizing them or making
fun of them on twitter there was always
this this this
absolute slander that like after the
election
it was we were the ones who wanted to
like have a separate peace with the
fascists or that we secretly would like
oh i'll have a deal with you all right
how about universal health care for
white people only
you know and this this outrageous
slander that like that they are the ones
who are the the the even they're [ __ ]
self-proclaimed the resistance
and here's what brings the [ __ ] lie
to it uh it wasn't
share blue people or [ __ ]
dnc people or people waving hillary
clinton signs
that was in the streets actually
fighting these [ __ ] nazis and by the
way
standing up against racism and for the
[ __ ] rights that we do have and
should have in this [ __ ] country
against people whose explicit stated
goal is to eradicate them
those are the people who were standing
up and the people who that [ __ ] drove
his [ __ ] car into
was the iww uh i think there were psl
people the www yeah they were they were
they're blm
black lives matter yeah all the like the
whole span of the left like
left of us you know yeah yeah but who is
posting
that's true that's the real question who
was roasting the
the shoes that looked like a fan that
those nazis were wearing
on twitter it was the resistance yeah
the resistance was taking all those
pictures and
saying who looked like a fam and why
and that's what got people out there but
this was the other thing that that
uh came up in the article was um that
there were these articles that came out
from liberal pundits like peter beinart
who wrote this thing about antifa uh
about
uh you know leftist activists who uh
they make it
a strategy to kind of confront fascists
protect their community
make sure that you know people don't get
hurt by nazis
and he said i think the phrase was that
they are actually unlikely allies
to the nazis and it's like
i mean were you there like was peter
beinart there like
saving the lives of people who are under
threat from nazis
no it was actually the same people he
was talking about
rendering equivalent to them and it's
like what what's the equivalent like you
got one side that's
that's saying uh we want to destroy jews
and blacks and muslims and the other
side that's like we want to destroy
windows
yeah like is that the [ __ ]
equivalents here well
but they do think that they're
equivalent in the sense that they
both sides by coming out into the street
and engaging in that kind of uh direct
action
are not doing politics right and by
doing that
are are uh basically reducing
our uh civility and the
norms and processes that we use to
determine
political outcomes right there's a
there's our appropriate channels for
doing that and it's
and it's you know op-eds and voting
basically
uh and to do anything other than that is
to disrupt
uh like the order of democratic
debate that we have in this country i
think that's the way that they would
think of it
as is you're out in the streets and
certainly if you're doing any kind of
property damage or physical altercations
with an opponent regardless of what your
point of view is
by doing that you are disrupting
normal democratic uh actions and
normal democratic processes right doing
politics right is basically making
excuses for the iraq war
yeah yeah as far as peter beinart goes
uh is it rich of him to talk about
[ __ ] advocating violence or
supporting violence in the street
he did it the right way by writing op-ed
after op-ed and supporting the iraq war
and
binary fine art is such a perfect
perfect guy for that [ __ ] viewpoint
because it isn't about violence
it's about like you said the method of
doing politics and
what binary his sort of neocon light
and liberal zionism just too
too very actually if you look at them
very extreme points of view
but because they're in they're in that
overton window of what's acceptable
there any violence necessary with
maintaining an ethno state
as long as it's along some vaguely
liberal principles
is okay the liberal etiquette that comes
up is always don't politicize someone's
death
and it's like the only excusable way to
politicize someone's death is to start a
war
you know like if people die and then we
go bomb
a country you know that's legit
but to say that like someone's death
means that we need
uh you know to fight for ideals of
justice then
we get attacked for politicizing
someone's death what's particularly
repugnant about this cottage industry
on the liberal centrist side of punching
left and attacking antifa
is that it it always comes from
a place of bad faith
and ultimately it's it's not a realistic
debate
because you're just debating made-up
[ __ ]
that shows up on fox news that is used
to
gin up the anger of scared old white
people
uh and as well it is quite rich
that people like being hard or chad or
the other
unnamables mark lillo was the other one
that came up
sure uh they can sit back and criticize
people like uh members of antifa or the
black lives matter movement which are
both
amorphous you know protean movements
with no real leadership structure
criticize people who go out in the
streets and face off against nazis
uh and criticize their tactics in terms
of this is bad optics
this is not a good communication
strategy uh if i were in charge of black
lives matter here's what i would do
and it's like you're not you don't do
[ __ ] you don't do anything who the [ __ ]
are you
to sit around that's the fundamental
flaw in all of their analysis
of how to deal with these emerging
public displays of
fascism is because i think that if you
ask them and you got
sort of a universe okay what would you
say what would you do if you could
like order everyone to do something i
think they would say uh
ignore them sir you should just let them
have their parade and just say
just give them none of the attention and
oxygen that they crave
and you know what i i can't even tell
them that that wouldn't work
in some vacuum i don't know but the
thing is that's literally impossible and
will never happen because these are
people
going out in the street intentionally
being provocative intentionally telling
[ __ ] saying with the all of the
[ __ ] air in their lungs that
a huge segment of their fellow americans
don't deserve to live
that is gonna bring people out in
response it is going to
so you cannot you your your smug
[ __ ] suggestion that everyone ignore
them okay
fine that's nice congratulations that
you have that idea it's not going to
happen
you have to start from the assumption
that people are going to want to engage
with that kind of public
uh as you as we said violence
and they're not willing to do that
because yeah as virgil is saying they
they imagine themselves uh as like as
able to dictate from their [ __ ] op-ed
pages and their twitter accounts on what
people are gonna do in a real world
where people have actual skin in the
game and are not doing everything
from the position of a totally removed a
totally secure white dude in their
goddamn pet at
tear uh making decisions for everybody
else right like you had mark lilla was
in the wall street
the wall street journal like the day
before this [ __ ] went down
the main paper the resistance yeah i
mean he was saying that uh uh i don't
understand what it's like to be
a black guy driving a car so you got to
explain it to me
you know it's on you it's on you to
convince me what that's like
and that it matters and that i need to
care about but they're already trying to
claim her the people who criticized
everything right about the the entire
spectrum
[ __ ] years to actually protest yeah
the people yeah who criticized the
entire spectrum that she belonged to
anna [ __ ] navarro oh who has a rag
who has [ __ ] bragged about her dad's
time with the contras
said heather's favorite color was purple
and she stood against racism
yeah and your dad would have [ __ ]
killed her if she was nicaraguan go
[ __ ] yourself yeah any of them felix at
that point like
about about these like these people and
like
what's what's worse is like when
confronted with like
the the reality of like organized
fascist violence in the streets
they always talk about claiming
something for themselves they just make
it about them and to protect themselves
again again from criticism from their
left to go
okay now it's really serious the
president is openly supporting white
supremacy
time to get on board and fight the real
enemy guys and it's just like you're not
doing [ __ ]
you're not fighting anyone why would
anyone join with you or like
or give you the benefit of the doubt or
hold hold
fire on you or just like reserve our
criticism
of you and your rotten politics because
[ __ ] oh shit's got real now
it's time to just you know uh you know
what i
before i was critical of the center for
american progress but you know now
uh i think we really have to join up
with them
because i mean they it's not like they
were the people whose
incompetent campaign and awful policies
and [ __ ] view of the world
are why this [ __ ] maniac is the
president
yeah that's exactly it and i you know i
want to clarify like
dude i was we weren't there like these
were are way better people than us for
[ __ ] being there like [ __ ] god
bless them
but to say now is really the time to
fall together
after you [ __ ] on all these people
before it became apparent they were
standing directly against the thing you
claim
you know and everything you did when you
were in power eight [ __ ] years we
ended up here we can't talk about that
you know who is politicizing her death
was her friend who was there with her
who had to watch her die
yeah and her mom who has to mourn her
they you know they've both been saying
that her death means that we just have
to make sure this [ __ ] doesn't
keep happening and that we have to fight
for a world where
uh it's not a possibility and i think
felix brings up a good point that i
really want to underscore i mean we're
talking
as we normally do about a lot of these
[ __ ] who we hate and we're just
like you know this is kind of like
we got to get it off our chest because
these [ __ ] people are so
infuriating but i don't think we should
let the show pass
without bringing up the people who are
mostly nameless
who were on that campus in the middle of
that torchlight parade
standing in the sea of those [ __ ]
chud
pieces of [ __ ] nazi [ __ ] and their
under armour polos and [ __ ]
citronella t-shirts
chat you know chanting standing in the
middle of all of that
saying you know with a banner that says
you know like we're just saying
we're against this [ __ ] you and the
people in the street who also
[ __ ] stood up bravely against these
[ __ ]
again most of them we don't know their
names but
i i don't think like we can talk about
all the [ __ ] who are annoying us
without really understating again the
bravery
of the people who stood up against this
can we shout someone out
yeah you guys do you guys see that
picture of the guy
uh using a spray paint
against the nazis i mean how [ __ ]
cool was that also and he was an
eldercare worker
he's an eldercare worker and i don't
know if you saw in this he was
protecting
he's protecting this hunched over old
white guy who looks like he runs the
general store
in like a 1940s western yeah yeah and
and
a guy you give one gold coin to and
gives you three horses this was the
yeah right exactly like this is what
people were doing out there was
protecting each other
i remember uh seeing uh the [ __ ]
all-right piece of [ __ ] uh
saying this man had a flame thrower
that is a chemical weapon he didn't even
have a flamethrower he like
it rigged a [ __ ] uh new weapon out of
a spray paint
and a lighter that [ __ ] is awesome yeah
by the way uh yeah
flamethrower that's hilarious and mace
what the [ __ ] is with these people they
they always they talk about
they're using mace against us these
[ __ ] came armed to the teeth with
real [ __ ] guns i love these people
like
they have some like conception where
every every conceivable weapon other
than a gun
is some sort of horrible thing this is
this
is the furthest reactionaries use the
norms of liberalism
that to break them they fall back on
them to defend themselves by yeah
well that's not that's not right you're
not supposed to bring flamethrowers
civilians
yeah we were non-violent we were being
non-violent yeah we talk a lot of [ __ ]
but we're non-violent
and matt this is something you've you've
uh you've
spoken on before i think that's
absolutely important the way these
people
always fall back on this idea of free
speech that's that's their little totem
because they can't
they don't quite yet have the confidence
to say ethnostate
genocide is what we actually believe in
so they say we're standing up for free
speech
yeah well the uh trillburn uh pointed
out that
that matthew heimbach [ __ ] was
standing in front of uh
the courthouse in virginia the other day
protesting
some horrible treatment of his [ __ ]
friends or something
and he was talking about how it was so
unfair that they didn't get any help
from the police they had their permits
while wearing a shirt featuring the
leader of the
romanian iron guard in 1941
perpetrated a [ __ ] pogrom uh against
the jewish population of budapest that
involved
hanging them on hooks in a [ __ ]
slaughterhouse
i mean the thing is that's that doesn't
give a [ __ ] about [ __ ] free speech
the concept of free speech the way we
talk about it is so abstract like yeah
you have free speech if you're a dead
corpse that a nazi just killed
so what you know like that abstraction
doesn't mean [ __ ] if you are actually
under threat and this is where like yeah
you run up against like the limits of
the liberal world view in that you have
a group of people
that like i said must be stated again
are dedicated to
morally and philosophically to the the
idea and practice of genocide against
races they regard as biologically
inferior to them
will use every pillar of liberal
culture and society to protect
themselves until they have enough power
to take it away from everyone else
they don't believe in free speech they
don't believe in [ __ ] human rights
they don't believe in non-violence
and the way [ __ ] people fall for this
over and over
again is stunning i'm uh kind of worried
that uh
autozone has uh fired nazi jeff
yeah yeah i'm not sure private companies
should have this much power
people who don't give a [ __ ] when people
get fired for participating in bds
marches or any [ __ ] like that union
drives yep
i do want to say one thing about the uh
sort of
broad reactionary movement that we kind
of talked about like before
we even recorded our episode yesterday
and that is
i think that this is gonna be a turning
point because it's a turning point that
you see in all
reactionary groups be they you know
[ __ ] japan al-nusra or the taliban or
this
and that is you know people start out
they get attracted to the big
the big names you know the jack prilos x
it's the
the moderate rebels and it's very
exciting and transgressive
for them the alt light people the media
stars
the periscopers the streamers right
before all the major infighting started
then the infighting started and you see
there's someone more extreme and it's
you know
the npi people or the [ __ ] you know
anything to the
right of those guys and hey [ __ ] you
know what if you're a
male from a dominant group who feels
like time has passed him up
and if you lived 500 years ago you
wouldn't you wouldn't be
sad and dislocated and a [ __ ] loser
like anyone who joined
you would have been issued a girlfriend
don't forget that look you're not gonna
drift towards the moderate you're gonna
go even farther
if you feel like you're in a war all the
time because you hate your life
yeah moderates don't last in war so
these people drifted further to the
right
but now that it's real i think this is
going to be
the part where some people get off the
train because
they didn't really imagine they would
have to answer this much a big thing
about like being transgressive in that
reactionary sense
is the very middle class and this is the
middle classness of this movement that
informs it
the very middle class sentiment that you
can snap back
to safety anytime you want yeah and it's
yeah
nothing this [ __ ] has consequences that
it's just lows
yeah oh for the lulls it's just you know
bands doing the bands
well you know it's also it's also a good
counter point when you brought up that
you know this is a middle-class move in
and also an upper-class movement
that a lot of um a lot of opportunists
uh say that on the center say that uh
you know oh well this is the fault of
bernie sanders
who said uh before the election uh we
should uh
think about you know the material
conditions of these people economic
anxiety
right right it's like well no it's all
racist but uh yeah the people who have
the means wherewithal to drive
from ohio or oregon
or maine to virginia uh
in order to go to a weekend nazi rally
are not
out of work uh coal miners yeah i mean
frank rich
said no more hillbilly allergies after
this which yeah hey [ __ ] that book but
like
you think those were [ __ ] hillbillies
you dumb piece of [ __ ] dude
all those people grew up in subdivisions
richard spencer has a master's degree
we're not talking about hillbillies here
you know what hillbillies were there
redneck revolts
was there yeah [ __ ] up some nazis
yeah
now okay so i think we should this is a
good segue i think we should also talk
about um
we talked about sort of the annoying
[ __ ] of the sort of centrist
liberals and their just supreme
misapprehension of the situation and
their
own rather nauseating ass covering in
the light of
uh the fact that they've now basically
helped sign
helped co-sign another major right-wing
talking point that i'm sure
you know be a new brain worm that i'm
sure will be infesting us all
for the next five to ten years at least
um
we should you know we should take the
centrist advice and talk about
the right and their reaction to this uh
beginning with
uh the president which was again let's
not mistake
ourselves at all he made a tepid
statement
calling decrying bigotry he read off a
teleprompter
and then less than 24 hours later gave a
press conference where don't kid
yourself he went out of his way to
uh apologize for and promote uh
just white supremacy of violence and uh
the the same people who did this [ __ ]
and like pretending like they weren't
all nazis or something ridiculous like
that
they love statues they love they love
statues
[ __ ] statues man and you know in his
own you know
well i'm sure there was at least one one
guys
you know what this is a type of copper
that we don't make anymore
let me tell you that's funny on two
fronts one most confederate statues are
mass-produced [ __ ]
garbage people that are aesthetically
garbage
and two the hilarity of aesthetic
lectures and historical lectures coming
from one of the biggest
philistine [ __ ] you know i can't
believe they wanted to take down the
statue of zeus
so listen i'm from state college
pennsylvania where penn state university
is and we had the joe paterno statue
which stood for months after
everybody knew he basically was enabling
a pedophile to run a charity that he
poached little boys from
and people rallied to defend that [ __ ]
you know
this kind of like uh mentality about uh
hero worship
bleeds into all over american society
i'm glad you brought that up because a
friend of mine proposed a compromise
now that now that uh confederate statues
are under attack
uh nancy pelosi came out with a
statement demanding that the governor
statues in the u.s capital
are the statues of confederates be taken
down
uh this is a compromise we take down
every confederate statue and replace
them with the statue of joe paterno
this will appease a hundred percent of
the cup oh yeah it's win-win
all the confederate defenders will be
like that's fine and then
the real solution will come when america
is part of the glorious caliphate
and all representatives
did you see a clip of the protest of
there's a statue of lenin in seattle
yeah
and there were like five people
protesting it yeah yeah jack [ __ ] uh
prostate
posted a video of like five people uh
with signs that were like
not even grammatically uh correct hitler
lenin equals hitler and marxist bigotry
marxist bigotry got him by the way also
that statue
is privately owned and on private
property so
you're lucky they didn't shoot you so
that's the [ __ ] that you're supposed to
be defending right private property hold
on a sec
matt brought up i think an interesting
point uh just a second ago matt you
talked about how
most of these confederate statues are
cheaply made chintzy [ __ ]
and i think it's important to point out
why which is that almost all of them
were not erected centuries ago but in
the 60s
as a deliberate affair basically
whenever the clans
spiked uh there was a huge explosion in
signs going in uh confederate statues
and monuments going up
yeah yeah yeah i mean i love the
argument around it like people aren't
gonna know their history if we don't
know the statues like most people learn
by taking walks and seeing statues and
going like
oh i didn't know we had a civil war well
how would you know about animals if zeus
didn't exist
yeah this idea that it's erasing history
it's a racing history to put them up
in the [ __ ] first place it can't be
said enough i thought this was common
knowledge
that the statues came up for that reason
and for the same reason that the
confederate flag
was put on multiple state flags in in uh
service of the great lie that the
southern cause was
good or decent or these were decent
[ __ ] people who died
uh fighting for slavery or uh in
opposition to
desegregation like the other element to
this is like again there's
the sort of alt-right and alt-light
people the alt-lite people are already
heading for the exits because these
people as we've discussed before
basically only just want to be media
celebrities
they want the next book deal they want
the next fox news appearance or their
whatever their rebel media network
[ __ ]
they can see their writing on the wall
[ __ ] what is it cernovich is now
being like i'm no longer
trump i'm just about journalism and
[ __ ] uh
baked alaska was like yo we gotta come
together we gotta stop calling each
other sj dubs and nazis
you know so like the old light people
and their fellow travelers i see i think
they see the writings on the wall and
they're heading for the exits
the other more hardcore people it's yet
to be seen how they're going to react
they're sort of debating
whether they should you know be a little
bit more quiet about some of their more
explicit goals
but then of course there is the broader
conservative movement in republican
party in general
and i want to talk a little bit about
how now
the appearance of this idea that they're
the
the silent majority of republicans that
are actually shocked and horrified by
trump
yeah i mean [ __ ] these people seriously
i can't wait till 2019 where
uh trump christens the next battleship
like the ss
jerry sandusky adolf hitler and we're
gonna hear about all the republicans in
private who are
fed up and then you know none of them
actually do anything and here's the idea
like like i said trump gave a press
conference where he all
but openly praised white supremacy
and and now like there are there are
murmurings of oh this is
simply too much he's he's unfit for
office here's the deal
as long as he passes tax reform they'll
let him sit and do whatever the [ __ ] he
wants
first of all he isn't going to pass tax
reform that's also going to blow up in
his face but second of all
i saw the other day yet another one of
those articles this might be
the hundredth one i've seen that is time
for republicans to say where you stand
this is enough politico
and you can guess what it is this
article pops up
every [ __ ] week that something
repugnant happens
it's uh you know uh republicans you're
better than this
we're better than this and the mirror
image of that
is the uh liberals who are the centrists
who are like
actually trump is uniquely dangerous
this week's events show that
and we keep [ __ ] seeing it and i'm
sorry if you didn't realize this guy was
a [ __ ] nazi from the second he went
down that [ __ ] elevator in his
[ __ ] building then you're an
imbecile you should never ever be
listened to
he talked about putting muslims on a
[ __ ] list
he talked about torturing family members
children
of uh alleged terrorists
it's been a white nationalist movement
from the start and [ __ ] you for
pretending otherwise
how many people uh who've had tutting of
him to do this week for his awful racism
have in the past voted for mandatory
minimum sentences
for drugs or [ __ ] a voter
disenfranchised
give me a [ __ ] i mean you had both like
uh like mitt romney
and uh chris christie both said some
stuff but actually you know
the sides weren't uh equivalent uh you
know we have to be against white
supremacy it's like you guys are
you're gonna go clean trump's toilet
with toothbrushes tomorrow morning you
know
yeah they didn't [ __ ] say this yeah
yeah they didn't actually call them out
they just uh you know
uh the estate of george wallace has come
up with a statement we are better than
this
uh doctor dr mangala's head in a jar in
argentina
has said sir so yeah like i mean this is
all completely disingenuous uh i said
save
save it uh to all these [ __ ]
seriously
like for me what's the most galling
of all of it is that
now there are many people
uh who you know prior to this would have
decried the alt left
or the bernie bros or whatever and now
saying uh
i'm alt left the pre that's a bad thing
oh yeah
oh yeah says is bad well i'm all left
all left means
uh gay people it means uh
supporters of charter school apps it's
uh the whole
resistance is all i mean the whole
concept of it was to say that like this
is the part of the left that hates poc
at the end of the day it comes back to
something that like you and i have
spoken about will
uh that ultimately the people who are
putting themselves
on the line here are members of radical
leftist political organizations they're
rabble rousers
they are members of uh the dsa and the
blm
the iww and
if the institutional establishment
center left whatever you want to call it
wants to take credit for that
if they want to rely on these radicals
as a barrier between them and fascism
if radicals are going to bleed and die
in that fight then radicals should lead
that coalition absolutely
and and what's more it's you know
i i mentioned this earlier this week
if uh those as you said centrists would
like
now to say we are the alt left um
i just only wish there was some sort of
uh ritual
act of submission or contrition they
could do
to the people who they've slandered
relentlessly
for years now some type of uh
physical action physical act
a display or maybe sort of like a pithy
phrase using a popular television show i
don't know
oh yeah no i i know i know uh bosh
you've gone too far they have to say
that to all of us
doctor who i love you uh bazinga
yeah but i mean yeah like exactly
like it it is hilarious to watch these
people like
as the alt light is also back pedaling
it is hilarious to watch these people
back
oh yeah it is hilarious again like uh
you know what like and like i said let's
welcome them with open arms if i
i agree you know the shared blue army
wants to you know get out there in the
streets and you know fight fascism i say
let's do it i have one share blue guy in
mind who may be good at that
i think you guys know who i'm talking
about i mean i know like a lot of these
individuals act in bad faith and are
still acting in bad faith and can just
be you know disregarded as cranks
but a number of them actually do see the
writing in the wall
in increasing numbers since the election
that
oh even if we do support policy
positions that
closer to the center and the status quo
we know that's totally not
tenable and it's not tenable for us to
be hostile to the left
a good example of that is uh iglesias
right
right after the election said ah [ __ ] we
were wrong no
bernie would have won but like you know
another thing that i've been thinking
about this week or
at least has been sort of crystallized
in my mind we talked about a lot of
these
really annoying people that'll mostly go
unnamed i'm sure you know who i'm
talking about
like it's been a running joke that i've
certainly been a part of for a long time
which is you know making fun of these
[ __ ] on twitter and the ridiculous
idiotic things they say
but like i feel like i've got to the
point now where like obviously making
fun of them is fun
and i think like there is an effect that
like people who are otherwise
not radical can sometimes if you through
humor can can see
or like you can pierce like the the sort
of pompacity and
uh ignorance of these people and i think
there's there's something
useful in that but like now as far as
i'm concerned especially
in the wake of what's happened in
charlottesville i just think there's no
point in even engage like ain't even
engaging and making fun of these people
anymore because the vast majority of
them
are [ __ ] nobodies who would have no
attention they don't
represent larger than the electorate i
mean i always thought there was never
really a point
except to the except to the extent that
some of them
actually do have the ear of powerful
people who are epistemically close
like for instance what obama what read
david brooks
every [ __ ] week yeah isn't that right
that's one of the most frightening
things
i mean how did we think that obama was
so smart if he's like reading david
brooks's column
yeah but like but to like people by the
point i mean like this to echo what uh t
said on our show a few weeks ago like to
sort of resp
like if you see like to respond to the
charge that like
the alt left quote unquote is the one
who
you know wants to make common cause with
racists
or you know make a separate piece with
uh you know fascism or whatever
or like doesn't stand for like against
racism
don't even respond to it like i know
it's it's calling
but like you have to understand like
what these these what these people are
doing which is they have nothing
they have nothing so just keep talking i
mean they have nothing in terms of an
argument or a coherent worldview or a
useful praxis but what they do have
is they are speaking on behalf of
a hegemonic liberalism
that is going to get us all [ __ ]
killed they've got a lot of money
i agree don't talk to them but because
they're distraction from the real
[ __ ] problem which is that fascism
arises
because of the collapse of uh
institutional legitimacy of liberal
institutions
and that's how it that's how we got
[ __ ] trump it's how we're gonna get
what's coming next
after him that's gonna be even worse
because
if you think there's not going to be
more ecological and economic
catastrophes in the future
that liberalism is wholly unsuited to
[ __ ] deal with
and that that failure is not going to
lead to
fascism filling that [ __ ] hole you
got another thing coming and
that's what these guys are these guys
who marched in charlottesville
these are the people who are aware of
the
unspoken premise of this sort of zombie
neoliberalism we're living in
which is that we're coming at a point
where there's going to be ecological
catastrophe
and it's going to either require mass
redistribution of the ill-gotten gains
of the first world or genocide
and these are the first people who have
basically said well if that's the choice
i choose genocide and they're getting
everybody else
ready intellectually and emotionally for
why that's gonna be okay when it happens
why they're not really people when we're
when we're putting all this money into
more [ __ ] walls and drones
and bombs and guns to keep them away and
so that we can watch them die with
clear consciences it's going to be
because we've been loaded with
the ideology that these guys are now
starting to express publicly
on the other side of them you have
people who are saying in
full [ __ ] voice no we have the
resources to save
everybody to give everybody a [ __ ]
decent
and and uh worthwhile existence and
that is what we want and that is the
[ __ ] real
difference between these two so you can
tell that to the next [ __ ] who tells
you
that there are actually two sides of the
same coin yeah you know what's gonna
happen yes
yeah you know what's gonna happen is
that the majority of people the majority
of americans who don't vote
who don't participate in the political
process uh when they start to look at
this
they're gonna see uh the nazis the
apocalyptic
destroyers of the world on one side
and on the other they're going to see
the dsa
black lives matter they're going to see
antifa
and what they're not going to see is
they're not going to see hillary clinton
out there they're not going to see
a center for american progress or share
blue or whatever the [ __ ]
those organizations are brookings
think tanks that are dedicated to
preserving stability and order
uh in in the liberal tradition they're
not out there fighting that fight
it's the left that's fighting that fight
and the apolitical masses
uh they're starting to see that now uh
and i may not be
the two by two tetris piece but i'm
black block
uh i i mentioned them before we i mean
you know i i know this will come as a
shock to them but
let's also shout out some of the uh the
marxist leninist groups as well some of
the more
uh or maoist or yeah let's also shout
out [ __ ] you
again ben c jacobs we said [ __ ] you on
the chelsea manning episode
when when she was freed uh then you got
body slam by that
italian man who was running for office
which i frankly
i hope you had a big breakfast that day
and then really [ __ ] smart
because then right after i hope he gets
uh he gets
uh off the top rope splashed from blake
fair than thor
he goes out he goes out yesterday and
says to people uh raising money which by
the way we retweeted this too to to get
some of the people who tore down that uh
stats that that confederate statue right
um to bail them out in durham to bail
them out he goes uh
i'm not sure if you're aware but the
person who was arrested is a maoist so
defends north korea and so i'm not sure
if i want them out of jail it's just
[ __ ] you you're useless not sure i want
that out of jail can we get that
republican to
to like uh have a fight with him again
yeah that was by the way i gotta say i
mean
we may we have we've made fun of tankies
on this show but how awesome would it
have been if in charlottesville the
tankies that had actual tanks
yeah yeah good point something beautiful
i saw this morning when uh in durham
uh uh hundreds of people went to the
police station and turned themselves in
in solidarity with a woman who was
arrested for tearing down the statue
and saying i was also there i also tore
down the statue and that's something
that we've seen for the past
week just small and large acts
of generosity and solidarity and moral
clarity
that has made me prouder than ever to
consider myself someone who stands with
the left
yeah and i just want to say conclusively
100
we're going to fix all the problems
[Laughter]
and that's it i had a buddy who was
there in charlottesville and he just uh
published his report on it
at the viewpoint and he said that you
know at the uh
on the right you saw this really strict
hierarchy
that had the like the celebrity uh
pewdiepies
and baked alaskas at the top who are
kind of being protected
yelling i'm a vip i'm on vip exactly
exactly it's like that's that's the
polar opposite of what you were seeing
on the left
and you know it's almost like hierarchy
versus uh egalitarianism is the defining
[ __ ] difference between the two
and you'd have to be a complete
blinkered [ __ ] to be confused about
that point
yeah i never bring that to my bodyguard
the other day yeah we
you know once and for all we're going to
say everyone on the left is equal
underneath us well
i mean you know it was it was the
refrain during the uh the the uk
election
like the corbyn labor party they're the
slogan we are many they are few
that was true then it's abs so [ __ ]
lutely true
about us and these alt-right [ __ ]
shuds
they're they're like i said it's it's
it's deadly [ __ ] serious what's going
on right now
but there are more of us than them by a
[ __ ] long shot
and like i said through solidarity and
like like i said like the acts of
bravery that we've seen coming out
of charlottesville i think these these
[ __ ]
are not long for this world and i don't
mean that in a violent sense i mean it's
like they're going
away wink they're going back to the yeah
they're they're going they're going back
they're going back to gaming they're
going back to [ __ ] hiding like the
[ __ ] snakes that they are
they're getting kicked out of gaming
yeah no no there's no refuge in it no
more gaming you're going to majeang
[Music]
[Laughter]
yeah all right i mean i think that's as
as good a place as i need to to wrap it
up
shuja thanks for joining us hey thanks
for having me guys
and uh like i said and i think in the
description to this article i think we
will have
i think have some links for to donate
for the like legal fees for either the
people who tore down that statue
or medical fees for any of the people
who were injured uh in charlottesville
um there'll be plenty there'll be plenty
more stuff like that so just uh keep
keep an eye out open in the uh the show
description if you want to help out
so uh until next time guys we'll see you
later
