on today's program
ladies and gentlemen uh welcome i now
am in uh i think this is
the oh you know the other day we had our
2000th
episode we totally forgot about it yeah
friday i didn't even notice
until i was a number in the show
apathetically steamrolled right through
we apathetically steamrolled through
that
in a uh we were in a grotesque fashion
um so happy 2000th
episode to us um
i i can't even imagine now let's see
that's been
uh eight years
so two thousand over eight years um
and i think uh prior to that i got to be
pushing somewhere around three thousand
three thousand thirty two hundred
episodes just period
um so
good luck uh to my kids combing through
all those
um uh also i should say um celebrating
now
uh almost uh i think this is the fifth
day which i have not said 2018
at the beginning of the announcements of
the show so i'm pretty excited about
that
uh folks the uh 2020 presidential
campaign
has started at least well i mean pretty
much in earnest
and we have pictures that a
um listener sent in
um from two nights ago i guess it was
was it two or three nights ago
when elizabeth warren was in iowa
and um apparently
uh these are from listener irma in des
moines
um people were excited to see elizabeth
warren i don't know if you can see that
but that is a
like at least two blocks worth of
well now make that three four blocks
of people lined up in iowa to
see elizabeth warren and um
you know there's a lot of excitement on
the
the ground for elizabeth warren these
narratives get built there was
you know people forget but uh in 2014
maybe it was 2012 elizabeth warren was
brought in to i think it was 2012
brought into a campaign for people like
claire mccaskill
and others um
she was an asset around the country to a
lot of people
and uh she's obviously uh
creating a certain amount of
consternation amongst um
folks in the uh center right
and ostensibly in the uh i guess the
right side
of the and by right i mean in terms of
uh their politics
of the democratic party um
here is stephen ratner on
uh morning joe uh stephen ratner you may
recall
was in charge of the um i think the gm
uh a bailout and of course also um
was charged by the sec with a
pay-to-play scheme
involving the new york state pension
fund um
back in his days as a
private equity guy and um
you know who amongst us
has not had to settle with the sec to
pay a 6.2 million dollar
fine for overstepping
um you know some of the fudging around
the edges
of things what is a kickback really
really honestly
an opportunity but uh here is um here's
steven ratner
on morning joe talking about some of the
hesitation
they may have you know um
i think uh sometimes you show your hands
a little bit too
early like you're supposed to hold your
cards a little bit closer to your vest
but i think um some people are
are so so deep
into the bubble that they really really
don't even realize what they're exposing
about themselves
so steve ratner i know that we don't
usually mika and i don't usually go
to political fundraisers oh pause it for
one second
um i just need to um i just need to
laugh
[Laughter]
i knew that that was a well-warranted
and
certain posit coming right yeah there we
go let's just
all right i'm sorry i don't usually go
to political fundraisers
uh uh for a lot of different reasons um
but i'm just curious when you uh
hold your political fundraiser for
elizabeth warren
steve can we just be uh sort of some
flies
because we really would love to be there
and just
see the embrace of of elizabeth's uh
the the respected senators populism well
you won't be a fly on the wall because
if i hold a fundraiser for elizabeth
warren and i go to my friends to ask
them to attend it will be a very sparse
crowd and so there will be room for you
to sit
right up at the head of the table next
to her and
enjoy the full no look in all
seriousness i think
i think everything that that you've
talked about and karen wrote about
elizabeth warren and her appeal and her
passion and
her populism is all true and i think it
will resonate to some degree
in the democratic party i would note she
doesn't poll as well
as some other bernie sanders in
particular candidates who are espoused
the same point of view and she's trying
to fix certain image issues and go
through all that
but the real question is when you get to
the general election
will a candidate who is so in effect
anti-capitalism anti-business anti-wall
street
anti-anti-rich
lot of things will that prevail even
against donald trump
is that it let's hear my waffle on a
little bit more i'm curious
will that prevail even against donald
trump in a general election and i think
there are those of us in the democratic
party
and this is not personal about elizabeth
who i think has a lot of a lot of great
personal qualities and is certainly
a very devoted public servant but is
that really
the type of candidate we want to put
into a general election
even up against donald trump yeah i mean
of course it is uh the proposals that
she
espouses are are wildly popular you want
to put up a candidate
who says we need to protect wall street
we need to protect the big banks
we need to protect the very wealthy in
this country because they're not getting
their share
good luck to you i mean what's amazing
about this
is that he is so divorced from
reality so unaware
of of what uh
the average american feels
uh towards um what's happened in our
society
that he doesn't even realize that what
he should be saying is that i'm not sure
that elizabeth warren has the charisma
or that he's got it completely backwards
he's already
showing his cards um in
a a way that i think is just a
fascinating
revelation about how how completely
divorced from reality
guys like this are they don't even have
the savvy
to hide the fact that they're sitting
there and shilling
for essentially
i mean not enough people to even fill
out a
a neighborhood in new york city
well maybe maybe in manhattan maybe just
the island half of
manhattan a few towers but i was going
to say but not even really because the
upper east side is actually bigger than
people
it's absolutely stunning i mean there
are
um you know the the i just don't
understand how someone can go on
and i'm not saying any candidate is
above critique but i don't
understand how anyone can go on
television
and say those things and think that
they're actually making an argument that
helps themselves
i mean because all the people who watch
morning joe
um or not all but a significant amount
they may already feel those things but
they
should be hiding the ball that's what
the republican party did for
decades well serious point and frivolous
point
and serious point is i do think there is
something specific about morning joe
in that it's like a feedback
loop elite to elite conversation so
there's something maybe about just
policing the boundaries of what's
acceptable inside that specific
conversation that happens on that show
uh maybe but that's the thing it's like
i i understand no i get a little more
wink wink i understand
i get it i agree but i'm but i do think
sometimes when you watch that show it
the only part of that show that has any
kind of public value is
it's probably the closest to being in
like steve ratner's townhouse talking
right
and it's like yes this is how they think
this is what the mentality is
frivolous point that was a much more
boring version
of the anna navarro uh get my love
juices flowing clip
from the other day can we get uh can we
get a can can we play that
drop can we get a candidate that um
myself and bill crystal will appreciate
you know me and bill crystal don't like
evert racism
uh and we liked your war and so maybe if
the democrats could do that
with a certain degree of class the
crystal night will be excited
unbelievable and i do well
i do think he certainly he was
ridiculous in the end but i do think he
had a serious point towards the
beginning
which is that she does have similar
politics to bernie sanders but is not as
compelling a candidate
in the general election i i mean that's
possible um i mean we got you know uh
we bernie sanders is you know if you had
talked about
bernie sanders six months before he ever
ran for office
um he would be polling nowhere uh on
on on a public level of course he was a
senator and
people were aware of him but um
i think we will get a better sense of
elizabeth warren's national appeal
when she's on a national stage and it's
not because mitch mcconnell's saying
hey you can't say you can't read coretta
scott's king's
words on the senate floor when she gets
out and she has the ability to
control the narrative that's i think
when you judge
bernie sanders you know what he pulled
before he entered the race
six months before he entered the race
was zero i mean maybe it was three
i don't know but uh diddy with a certain
degree
of class is one james i am
begging democrats to please give me
somebody that i can
vote for yeah fair enough i'm just a
little worried that she's gonna get all
of the bad
parts of being like bernie and none of
the good parts
you know like these folks like this guy
are
always going to say she's an
anti-capitalist no matter how many times
she says
there is no doubt in my mind that steve
ratner will vote against um
elizabeth warren but i suspect that
if you were to take a poll of of
women particularly the women who drove
this last
midterm election that it's quite
possible elizabeth warren would be
at the very least competitive uh with
bernie sanders we're atner
if uh sanders or warren and potentially
sherry brown
is the nominee steve ratner will write
in erskine
bowles there you go that's my prediction
folks one of today's sponsors

in the podcast description check it out
quick break when we come back
ian millhiser on the gerrymandering
cases heading to the supreme court and
uh
perhaps the legality of what we
anticipate donald trump will be doing
tonight on television
be right back
cedar on the majority report on the
phone it is a pleasure to welcome
back to the program the editor
of uh the justice editor for
thinkprogress.org
ian millhiser in uh welcome back to the
program
it's good to be here thanks so much all
right let's start
with um the uh the gerrymandering
cases that are heading to the supreme
court because
there is a um a fairly significant
backstory
to these um to these uh gerrymandering
uh cases
and the gerrymandering cases that have
been in front of the supreme court and
there's a fairly troubling
um what do you call it future story uh
that could be uh
happening here um tell us just give us a
little bit sense of the history of
gerrymandering
cases that have gone to the supreme
court
yeah this is gonna end really badly so
the relevant history here probably
begins with 2004.
um in a case called the
jubilee um justice scalia wrote an
opinion on behalf of four members of the
court
saying that not only are we not going to
strike down the gerrymander that's being
challenged in this case
but we but our view of the view of these
four justices
is that partisan gerrymandering is just
not a matter for federal courts at all
federal courts can never consider a
partisan gerrymandering case
um justice kennedy gave people a little
bit of hope in that case though because
he wrote a separate opinion where he
said you know i'm not going to strike
down this
gerrymander but in a future case you
might be able to convince me there's a
standard i could use
to sort out which which gerrymander is
not allowed
and so that was the hope that people
brought into the last supreme court term
where they thought there's this terrible
wisconsin gerrymander there's this very
aggressive
democratic gerrymander in maryland
surely we can get justice kennedy to say
that these crossed the line and people
had some really
you know promising legal theories well
justice kennedy decided to punt the
issue
and he decided to punt the issue and
then a few days later he left the court
and go ahead go ahead well the
the the hopes for uh kennedy were that
he had specifically asked
for basically it asked to a social
scientist
i guess broadly speaking come up with a
way in which we can measure
when something has been overly
gerrymandered and
in fact social scientists did that with
a concept of wasted votes right
that's right yeah i mean that so kennedy
had said look i need
it's hard to determine which maps are
partisan gerrymanders and which ones
aren't i need
something objective something clear-cut
that lets me sort bad maps and good maps
and there were a bunch of theories that
people came with they were basically
just mathematical formulas where you
could
take the the records from the last
election plug into this formula
and that would tell you if this map was
likely to be a gerrymander or not
um and so people were really really
hopeful i mean i remember attending the
oral argument
in the wisconsin case and thinking oh
yeah we've got five votes
like they're going to strike this map
down things are going to get better soon
and that is just not what happened
kennedy decided
not to decide the case and then he
decided to give the middle finger to
everyone that was hoping that
he would stick around and retain some
semblance of the rule of law
in this country and trump replaced him
with brett kavanaugh who of course
threatened senate democrats in his
confirmation hearing said that what goes
around
comes around because democrats dared to
probe allegations that kavanaugh
tried to rape someone um and
we should say in terms of wisconsin um
the
the theories uh i guess the uh the
algorithms that would determine wasted
votes
um it seemed to be borne out when you
look at the
results of the last election where
democrats won what was it 54
of the vote and republicans took
63 percent of the seats in the state
house
that's right that's nice i mean that's
just like
i want everybody just to sort of like
marinate in that
we uh you know this is not the sentence
the senate being appointed by
land owners you know this is not the the
senate
set up as a way of not being
particularly democratic in terms of the
number of people representing
this is on a fairly localized level
where you have the va the you know a 54
54
to 46 split that's like what we would
call a landslide
right i mean yeah yeah i mean wisconsin
for all intents and purposes is not
is no longer a democratic state like i
mean they have a democratically elected
governor who
as of i think yesterday is a democrat
um but their legislature it is
impossible i mean absence like you know
i mean maybe if democrats managed to get
60 or 70 percent of the vote it would
happen
but that's not happening in wisconsin it
is impossible
um for democrats to wish to win the
state assembly
when you have a map where you can get 54
percent of the vote
and the other car you still get 63
percent of the seat so that's how
aggressive
this gerrymander is that justice can be
looked at and said you know instead of
doing something about this i'm just
going to leave it to brett kavanaugh
um you know so that's that's the
position we're in right now
and what i think is likely to happen now
that these cases are back this time it's
a north carolina gerrymander which is
almost as aggressive as the wisconsin
one plus the maryland case again
um and what's likely to happen is i
think you've got five votes right now to
just say you know what
gerrymandering's not the business of the
federal courts federal courts will never
do anything about gerrymandering and if
you're an entrenched political party who
that wants to ensure that you never lose
control of your state legislature again
go to
town that's a pretty convenient timing
for a republican uh supreme court to be
making that proclamation
um and we should say there's a there's a
case in maryland right
that is also that is that is being
brought against democrats
um as a way of basically trying to
just get the gerrymandering under some
measure of control
right yeah i mean the maryland case it's
one of the few states so
part of the history here is that
republicans had a great electoral year
in 2010
and a big problem with our system is
that
um new maps must be drawn every 10 years
every time there's a new census and so
if you happen to win
if your party happens to win the year
that end in zero
that means you don't just get control
for two years or until the next election
it means you also get to draw the state
legislative and the congressional maps
and so since republicans swept through
basically all the swing states
in 2010 they were then able to draw
these maps that entrenched their power
and now you know going into the 2020
census
and then going into the next um
the next round of redistricting
in states where republicans still
control the legislature and can't be
dislodged
you know in some states maybe they'll
they'll be able to they'll be able to
democrats will be able to capture the
governor's mansion um
and so they'll be able to at least veto
the worst gerrymanders
but republicans have a huge advantage in
these states because they're guaranteed
to control the legislature
and there's even some states in north
carolina i believe
the governor doesn't have the power to
veto or redistricting that
and that republicans and that was we
should say
that was from a uh
lame duck session in north carolina like
the one that was done in wisconsin
although evers doesn't seem to be
basically
basically saying like you can sue me in
terms of uh of
of of abiding by those laws but if i
remember correctly
the reason why the democratic
governor in north carolina can't veto it
is because of laws that were passed in
the lame
duck basically stripping him uh or
you know her in the future uh of of
their ability to do that
well yeah yeah i'm not sure about the
origins there but like you know the
point is
that you know they have managed
not just to entrench their rule for 10
years but potentially manage to entrench
their rule
permanently because the only way
to dislodge republicans from their
control of the state legislature
is to win a state legislature for
democrats to win a state legislative
race
that cannot be won because republicans
drew the maps
now there is a there there seems to me
to be a very sensible and rational way
to deal with this
if the um the state
uh the the the citizens of the state
vote
to create like an independent commission
these things are never perfect
right but at least an independent
commission would have some semblance of
of in neutrality to some extent
right so that seems like the most
rational um
um decision that can be made but
dot yeah right so
a lot of states you know arizona has won
california has one you know quite a few
states i think
you know michigan and wisconsin just
passed ballot initiatives whose purpose
is to make it
harder to gerrymander or at least
michigan did um
but the problem is that um
a few years ago there was a case
challenging the arizona
redistricting commission and the good
news is that the supreme court
voted five to four to say yes you can
have this redistricting commission
the bad news is that the fifth vote was
guess who anthony kennedy
and anthony kennedy's been replaced by
barto kavanaugh
who said that he's going to uh take
revenge
on democrats so there is a very high
likelihood
that these independent commissions are
going to come before the supreme court
again
that there will now be five votes to
strike them down and that means that the
supreme court will make gerrymandering
even worse than it already is what is
the possible
justification for striking down
these uh independent commissions
sure so the constitution says
that um as a general rule legislative
map shall be drawn
by these by being led by the state
legislatures i think it says by the
legislator
thereof which thereof referring back to
the state
and so the argument is that the word
legislature in that context
means the elected body of lawmakers who
typically make laws
the problem with that argument is that
there's at least a century of precedent
saying that in this context that's not
what the word legislature means
the word legislature means anybody in a
state
that is empowered to make laws so that
can be for example
a ballot initiative but what the
dissenters
argued in the arizona case is that they
argued
that only the state legislature and not
a ballot initiative
is permitted to um to reign in
gerrymandering
but isn't there i mean and i guess maybe
you've just answered that by saying that
there's a century of precedent but
we see this all the time where the
legislature can
farm out um uh their authority right
and either affirmatively or by the
nature of
the um the the i guess the the
constitution of the state
right yeah and actually i mean under the
theory of the dissenters
things would get really really troubling
i mean if you take their argument
seriously and does that mean that a
governor
cannot veto a um a a redistricting bill
because the governor is not the
legislature he is the executive
and therefore in states like say
wisconsin where
democrats are counting on the democratic
governor to veto
the next republican gerrymander that the
governor can't do that
does that mean that it takes like
pennsylvania where
the state supreme court struck down the
gerrymander
that well the the judiciary is the
judiciary not the legislature so maybe
the judiciary isn't allowed to weigh
in um and so this could take us to a
world
if you know the dissenting view in the
arizona case ultimately prevails
where the only people who are allowed to
draw maps
are legislatures which are controlled by
republicans because republicans entrench
themselves in the 2010 election as it
turns out the 2010 election is the only
election that'll ever
matter again because you know once you
gain control
of the state legislature it's impossible
to dislodge
dislodge the party that controls it
is there um is there any
way that now these cases in north
carolina and
and maryland don't necessarily
implicate a um a referendum
for creating an independent commission
is there any way
that the court i mean i know there's
probably a way but is there what's the
likelihood
of the court saying hey and incidentally
even though this is not
um uh at issue in this case
since we're here we might as well also
say independent commissions
not kosher i mean i i don't think that
they'd strike down into
independent conditions in either the
north carolina
or in the maryland case because neither
one of those states has been it has an
independent coalition
or independent commission but all it
takes i mean arizona could do it again
you know all it takes is for republicans
to file the exact same lawsuit
they filed in arizona a few years ago
they can even
dust off the same brief that they filed
and just refiled them
and you know now it goes up to the
supreme court again
and the supreme court says ah there were
four of us last time but there's five of
us now
you lose uh that would seem
like a uh you know pretty naked uh
nakedly partisan uh
um ruling wouldn't it but i do do you
think they care
i mean maybe they care i mean that
that's the
you know that is the question on which
the rule of law in this country hinges
is and not specifically who if they care
but if chief justice john roberts cares
i i i mean
there are you know the angel and the
devil sitting on
roberts's shoulder if he has a devil
that says
oh you just want conservatives to win
everything you should do that
and he has an angel who says you know if
you push
too hard then you're the supreme court's
going to be
delegitimized people will stop listening
to your decisions
and that's going to undermine your
ability to enact conservative policies
in the long run
and the question is whether he listens
to the angel or he listens to the devil
and i i mean no one but john roberts
knows who's who's he's gonna who's gonna
listen to in any given case
i like how uh john roberts is uh angel
is just a
sort of uh pragmatically evil um
uh right devil i mean he's just yeah
like there's there's nothing good
there's the devil
and then there's just the more pragmatic
devil that sits on his shoulder yeah i
mean
there's the lawful evil john roberts and
there's the chaotic evil john roberts
and you know you never know which one's
going to prevail um
all right so uh with that said we will
keep an eye on that we are probably
a year at least a year away i guess from
the potential of the independent
commissions being struck down
um and you know because of the nature of
like
if you can get a if you can get a
democratically elected governor you can
get a
a referendum like we've seen in michigan
to uh have an independent commission
which could be
you know the sort of the last saving
grace so i guess we're a year away from
from finding out whether at the very
least a year away
are there or is it possible they could
take another case this late
i mean they could potentially take the
case but i don't think that there's one
i don't think there's one in the works
okay i mean what happened you know
the saving grace is that someone has to
follow the case that's to go to the
district court
the district court has to like say hey
this is the exact same case that the
supreme court decided
three years ago go away and then and
then that goes up to the
the supreme court so that will take time
there is however plenty of time
for the supreme court to decide
something like that before the 2020
um redistricting cycle great um
all right well let's uh turn to uh
something else that's
uh probably gonna be as equally as
disturbing um
tonight uh donald trump is gonna go on
television
and um he is going to tell us that
um our our lake houses in minnesota
are subject to uh being
rampaged by another caravan or something
to that effect
and he's going to have to declare a
national emergency
what and i guess ostensibly to build to
build
um a i don't know a mile and a half
stretch
of a wall or a slats or whatever
steel uh cladding uh what
does he have give me your sense from a
legal perspective like
how does this go down so
well i guess there's two questions here
like the one question is
so what trump is apparently
contemplating is he's gonna declare a
national
emergency and then say because there is
emergence an emergency
i can now order the u.s military to go
build the wall
even in the absence of congressional
authorization
or an appropriation allowing me to do so
and you know the answer to the question
like if if you asked me to like read the
statutes myself if i were the judge i
would look them and say no no he can't
do that
but that's not the the important
question whether this is legal or not
the important question is
whether this supreme court will pretend
it's legal because they're republicans
and so is donald trump
and i think it's likely they're going to
say it is i mean i mean i've been
looking at
the statutes and staring at them all day
and it's not as clear-cut as i hoped it
would be i
i mean i basically what it turns on
is that there's a federal law saying
that
trump can declare an emergency and then
he can you he can authorize construction
projects provided that the emergency
is for you requires the use of the
of the military and so i don't think
this requires the use of the military
there's no reason like
the reason why trump can't build his
wall isn't that there's some
emergency and the only way to address it
is to send troops
the reason why trump can't can't build
his wall is because he's unable to
convince
congress to pass the to pass a law
letting him build the wall so in my mind
that's not an emergency that
requires the use of the military i mean
among other things building isn't
something that you need troops to do you
know civilians can build things
just fine but you go to war with the
supreme court you have not the supreme
court you want
and there is a long line of precedence
saying that as a general rule
um courts should defer to the president
in matters of national security um i
think
that if there are five people in the
supreme court who
want to side with donald trump and there
will there probably will be
like it'll be possible to write a
judicial opinion
that passes the last test arguing that
he can do this and that's all they need
who would have standing to bring this
case i mean who would sue
i mean i guess ostensibly probably
congress right because the
he's a he would somehow get money that
has not been appropriated by congress
yeah so the the the best plane it would
be i mean a lot of the land that this
you know wall would be built on is owned
by
private citizens and so if one or more
of those private citizens
refuses to sell it to the government
then the government would have to use
the eminent domain power to force a sale
and so that person i mean it's you know
it's
you clearly have standing if the
government comes up to you and says hey
that land you own
we're gonna we're gonna buy it from you
you can't say no
so like there's no question that that
person has standing
i also think that that's the best
plaintiff because like
you know in political cases like this
they aren't about the law they're about
competing
values and you have to appeal to the
values of one of the judges whose vote
you're trying to get
in order to convince that judge to be on
your side and so
i think there's an off chance that
if like a property owner comes into
court and says look
i am a property owner guys like you love
iran
like i'm the person you're supposed to
be looking out for
so protect me i think that there is an
off chance that someone like thomas or
gorsuch might be
you know by job i do love iran i'm not
here to protect muslims but
property owners those are important
people so there's an
off chance that i think you know one of
the republicans on the court could rebel
but realistically speaking like this
this is the court that upheld the muslim
ban i i think they're going to be very
deferential
to a republican president and
and and that scenario we're talking
about
is months away right i mean so the idea
is that donald trump says
we're building the wall i can do it i'm
getting the money from here or there
and he starts to build the wall or he
doesn't it doesn't you know
from a political standpoint um
it it it may very well be irrelevant or
i guess
you know whether there's a legal
recourse
because he's just he just wants to say
he's going to build it anyways
and that's basically that's basically
it i mean i guess the um the question is
legally speaking if he is allowed to do
this it seems like it might open up a
set of can of worms
or no for future presidents
oh there's no let's be clear about what
what donald trump at least like
according to news reports is
contemplating
donald trump is saying that he can use
the united states
military to take people's land
i mean think about that for a second i i
i mean like
you don't have to be a a crazy
libertarian
to you know to listen to that he wants
to use the military
to take people's land to be
uncomfortable with that i i and like
isn't that like posse comitatus i mean
isn't there
i mean a whole raft of i mean aside from
just sort of like
uh the you know sort of uh takings and
uh
eminent domain like isn't there aren't
there restrictions i mean i guess
we saw that play out at the border when
the military was sent down there
and um i guess it was kelly and maybe
mata said like you can't really do that
legally and they just did it right
right yeah the posse comatitis statute
says that you can't use the army or the
air force to
enforce domestic laws so you know you
could argue that this violates
that statute there's a lot of really
good arguments that you can raise but
again in these politically charged cases
they don't operate at the level of laws
they operate at the level of values
and so what i'm hoping happens is that
there's at least one republican on the
supreme court
who who thinks about this again we're
talking about the president
ordering the military to take people's
land
you know and and that that should shock
you i mean
it should shock them and like these are
people are supposed to care about
property rights
so i i think that's the best shot of
stopping trump here is to get someone
like a thomas or gorsuch
to understand that again he wants to
order the military to take
people's way you know maybe that'll be
enough
but i'm not optimistic yeah uh
i will not hold my breath um ian
millhiser
um thanks for i mean well so let me just
ask you this and this might be outside
your
your uh your portfolio but from a um
a political standpoint he gets up there
tonight
he announces that uh there's a national
emergency
um despite the fact that we found out
the administration had to walk back
uh the four thousand terrorists uh
crossing the border uh it turns out
there were six people
over the past two years who were on the
terrorist watch list
which of course you know at one point i
think senator kennedy was on that list
too
so uh that list is of of dubious um
uh nature but nevertheless so
do you have a sense and like i say maybe
this is outside your portfolio but
uh he announces hey i'm building the
wall i
i'm gonna get the money from the dhs
and uh taking it you know because it's
national emergency powers from the
you know uh this surplus budget and
we're gonna build the wall
and so uh i don't care if you put it in
the uh budget or not
i'll sign the budget is it and then just
we're done the the government shutdown
is more or less over tomorrow
yeah i mean that's there's the
possibilities that trump uses this is
out so he can end the shutdown before
people start getting really mad because
they aren't getting they aren't getting
their
uh their tax refunds i mean maybe this
is just his big leaf that he's using but
the problem with this fig leaf
is that like i don't know that
that this supreme court is going to get
the joke i don't know that they're going
to realize that like
the point of this is you know it is to
strike it down
um you know maybe they will and like
maybe they will understand i mean again
if the president can order
the military to take people's land then
i don't know why president elizabeth
warren can't say okay i'm going to order
you know i think it's a national
security threat that too much banking
power is concentrated in two huge few
individuals
so i'm going to order the military to
seize the banks you know i
i don't know why president ocasio-cortez
can't say you know i think it's a
national security emergency
that poor people don't have adequate
access to health care so i'm going to
order the military to seize a bunch of
people's land so we can build public
hospitals there
i i mean if if if the roberts court
really wants to go
there then like you know they can cut in
ways that they're not gonna like
that doesn't necessarily sound too bad
to me
but um i guess we'll have to wait and
see emil heiser
um justice editor thinkprogress.org
thanks so much for your time today i
really appreciate it
all right thank you all right well there
you have it folks um
get ready uh we now have the opportunity
for uh
president uh warren and vice president
uh
casio cortez to um to use the military
to start to um
ex-appropriate uh land i guess there you
go
hell yeah now of course it's gonna be
done with the military but um
now what do they do they redesign the
military uniforms
they make them a little like everybody
gets a red beret or something like that
what happens in that situation they
should dress like yankee doodle is that
it
um so uh 9 p.m
uh eastern tonight to um
for the uh
for the uh uh speech by uh donald trump
i may uh i may hop on
on youtube live streaming at the house
if the kids are asleep
uh by that point maybe get some uh
feedback from myla
on this uh tonight but um we're gonna do
a
unlocked post-game mystery science
theater of it as well oh is that right
oh yeah okay you got it i mean this is
like the full deployment of clown
fascism
you can't ignore it yeah we're going to
continue ignoring it
i you know i have a feeling it's not
going to be terribly dramatic it's
going to get bad we are going to be so
bored this is going to be written
i'm going to be sniffing so much
adderall i'm
just going to be able to get through
this thing in about 30 seconds i wanted
to have a tony montana moment
but they hummed me in totally
unfair oh this was a pretty good moment
i i have to concede that i
i missed the golden globes um this year
which is something i always do um
i always make it a point of missing the
golden globes
and then what i like to do is follow
that up with uh missing
the emmys and the grammys and the oscars
i like to miss all of those
every year but i catch the tonys but
uh the the one i do like to watch
is the espys now i'm joking is that
still around
sps gets emotional they do montages very
well
isn't they ask me like they give awards
to uh sports teams hell yeah
okay that to me seems a little bit
a little bit redundant because the one
of the ways that sports teams get
awarded is they win
and then they get they they win the
championship there's a lot of random
chance in sports
that's true this is this is for the
deserving sports teams who happen to
have lost
to the less deserving we want a
democracy and not a meritocracy
but uh nevertheless um there was a good
uh moment in the um uh oscars which i i
thought were not oscars the
golden globes which um i feel like was
um was missed right because uh fox and
friends yesterday talked about
how um uh what's-his-face uh from uh
veep
um was that actor's name again uh
julie louise rifas no not uh vice i'm
sorry
the actor from chris christian bale uh
had had said something political and
they were very upset about it because it
was an otherwise non-political night oh
that was great they were like oh this is
just
i like what they're they're like you
know this is just great just great shady
works
so hard in this country and you know
you're just
up there doing your movies you just
gotta be so rude
so rude anyway the golden girls turns 40
this year
uh andy sandberg um uh
this is going to upset them too yeah
this is going to upset them but i don't
think they picked up on it but
it's a little late on the uptake on this
one uh but he was
talking about um uh the black panthers i
guess they uh won some awards
uh the um not the the group the the
movie
and uh he had this to say which i
thought was uh
was pretty good not uh not necessarily
something i would
expect from him but maybe that's my own
my own bias you know
if you told me as a kid growing up in
the bay there'd be a movie called black
panther that starts off in oakland this
is not what i would have imagined
ryan were there like a bunch of old
members of the actual black panther
party
saying i can't even get an audition just
kidding they were all framed and
murdered for wanting justice and
equality the world is and always has
been a nightmare it just seems worse now
because of our phones what else happened
this year
there you go
oh that one really slipped under the
radar yeah look at the way yahoo
entertainment wrote up this bit so
if that sounds a bit awkward what it was
but not as awkward as sam berg's
attempts to poke fun at black panther
director ryan coogler by asking if
members of the actual black panther
party tried to audition for that
blockbuster marvel movie
coogler's confused reaction spoke for
all of us at home i don't think he was
confused that was definitely no i take
away
that bit absolutely it was an awkward
moment who wrote that on yahoo it wasn't
chris rosen was it uh could please
let's oh no no i'm joking um
yeah i have a feeling hi this is ethan
although i who went to david i have a
feeling ethan just sort of like
uh you know quickly scribbled that off
as he was uh
he's writing he's writing up something
let's be more generous maybe
maybe ethan went to go take his fits
during
midway through that joke and he didn't
get the punch line
because you know what if he didn't turn
it into that joke i guess it would have
been kind of
awkward like if he didn't follow it up
with a joke about call and tell pro and
it was just about like eldridge cleaver
trying to audition or something sure i
guess that would be awkward it would be
yeah yeah so maybe ethan missed it maybe
he's just
lazy versus that's right absolutely
that's what i'm saying he just he just
like
uh no i've just i've been like in the
room though
well that's what i'm saying yeah yeah i
mean i mean i think that flies over a
lot
people don't understand like who fred
hampton is right like people have no
idea of this history really a lot of
white people i'm saying
right yeah i was gonna say a lot of work
could the camera person not have found
one person who was having a big reaction
to it
i feel like there's gotta be there had
to be one you mentioned ryan coogler
specifically so that's why the camera
he said ryan he said he literally spoke
to ryan
um but uh there he is uh so uh good for
uh andy sandberg
um all right let's take a quick break um
a reminder this program relies on its
support from its members
to function every day you can become a
member by going to
jointhemajorityreport.com and when you
join the majority majorityreport.com
what happens is we give you extra
content every day and then
you know uh some extra extra content
sometimes too
um not all the time because we like we
like to cap it at
six hours or seven hours a week but uh
sometimes we give
i wish we could hypothetically steamroll
more of that content frankly
i don't know what that means
explain to me how to use it properly we
wouldn't have
you would apothecally bulldoze that
comment because if you steamrolled it it
would simply flatten it
if you bulldoze it you'd be pushing it
out of the way i choose my words
very carefully sam and the
democratic performance was impotent and
pathetic you're
scared your favorite communist claire
mccaskill
lost her seat and it's because of people
like you
who demonize those of us who support the
president the
the the conservative pushback is
starting in north dakota
um also justcoffee.com fair trade coffee
tea or chocolate use the coupon code
majority get 10
off uh from your just coffee
which is delish uh today is tuesday
that means it is the night that the
michael brooks show happens
michael tell us more no mickey const is
talking about her
great campaign for public advocate we
will also have a little announcement
about something we're doing with regards
to that
la teachers strikes a little elicit
minor uh mini illicit history on strikes
and then we are going to you know dave
ruben turkey there's a bunch of stuff
going on but we're going to do mystery
science theater
reuben turkey dave rubin and well um
erdogan just wrote an op-ed in the new
york times about his plans
after trump pulls out dave rubin's plans
well i was if erdogan wasn't muslim i
think like a
a sort of fascist essentially like
choreographing his plans for ethnic
cleansing in the new york times would be
sort of
peak idw so that's how i connected in my
mind at least
then we're doing mystery science theater
coverage of uh
the announcement tonight uh and
around 7 10 or so we're starting uh
michael brook show youtube channel
patreon.com tnbs for everything jamie
the antifata the government
we all hate it but what happens if it
just decides to go away
recently i joked on the majority report
that that would be cool
others like the anarchist collective
crime think have argued this point
in earnest uh in this very special
patrons only bonus we read their article
to that effect
and point out some flaws in their
reasoning because while we all agree
with their vision of a self-organized
stateless society
we have a long way to go before that's
possible folks
long way to go matt
uh yeah literary hangover there's gonna
be a members only hangover uh in the

into the majority report sam will be
with you shortly
uh yes folks uh the number is six four
six
two five seven six four six two five
seven thirty nine
twenty is the number sometimes like you
know you you
you say the number so often and then uh
when you actually think about it uh
you forget about it let's i this story i
um i've been following with some
interest for
a couple years you know one of the
things that the obama administration
and the name of the official
in the education department slips my
mind and i think he's now on the federal
trade commission he
one of the things that the obama
administration did that i thought
was um
was an unmitigated success and good
thing
was their crackdown on for-profit
universities
very recently in fact i think we talked
about this last week
there was a holding in the dc circuit
court
that the education department
could not reverse um
the uh the the payments that were owed
um students who had been ripped off by
for-profit uh universities here's the
scam with the
for-profit colleges a huge percentage
now look they're not all horrific
personally i think none of them should
exist
um at the very least
the question is should they be eligible
for federal
funds in terms of loans and
what the obama administration did was
basically start to actually scrutinize
the accrediting firms of these uh
colleges so these colleges would get
accredited
by accrediting outfits and that would
mean that they were eligible to get
student loans and what they do
it's sort of like the radio business in
the radio business the key was always
holding people over that first break at
15 minutes
that's all that anybody cared about you
just got to hold people over that break
over the quarter hour and that's how you
get your ratings at these for-profit
universities when it comes to loans
anyways um
they get their second they're always
looking for this the next installment of
the loan because the loan gets dished
out per semester or so
and uh they want to hold the students
over
uh to the next semester and many of
these students tend to be people who did
not have the opportunity to go to
college
uh when they were younger they've
entered the workforce they want to
they are looking specifically less so
for
you know sort of broaden their liberal
arts understanding let's say
but want to enhance their careers
so there would be a very simple metric
and to measure
the success of these schools um
that is what is the rate what is the
rate of return
on this investment you borrow thirty
thousand
forty thousand dollars fifty thousand
dollars to go to this for-profit
university
how much money are you making more than
you would on the trajectory you were
making
three years out two years out five years
out this is a fairly easy metric but
it's very hard to find that metric at
these schools oddly enough
and so the obama administration began to
crack down on him in fact two
major universities if i remember
correctly we had to go down itt
and um i can't remember the name of the
the second one but it was it was a very
large
enterprise and so these for-profit
universities which are big
business big business publicly owned
uh businesses in fact um in many
instances you can buy stock
you can buy their stocks their stocks
started to decline because there was
more and more scrutiny
and the vast amount
80 90 percent of their revenue
comes from the u.s government in the
form of these loans
so here's an interesting thing um i
haven't been able to find one that that
that takes us to the present day but
this this one captures
the first four months
following the election starting in
november uh of 16
you can see the day of the election
that's where the
uh the stocks are basically and if you
had gone a month or two earlier if we
could have found that
you would have seen a slow decline
actually uh
if you'd gone 16 months earlier you
would have seen a slow decline and then
look at that they jump within
literally a week of the election
the stocks jump
by 10
they go from zero to 15 now 15
before november 16 it be before december
1st
of that of of 2016.
and um and then they continue to
skyrocket
uh some go uh you know by february
they're up 25
30 40 almost in their value
and if you look at the um the s p
500 it's about 10 you know by that time
so like three times and
and i think these stocks have continued
to skyrocket
why is that well because uh betsy devos
was the um is the secretary of education
and um these universities
knew that essentially the cops had been
told
no longer scrutinized
you don't have to worry about this in
fact the trump administration now
plans to release a draft of proposals to
further deregulate
higher education on monday that would be
i think it was as of was that yesterday
i don't know if they've released them
yet
it's going to make it very easy for
non-accredited
unvetted institutional providers to
access federal student aid money
it's going to allow these entities to to
further outsource
the things like you know quasi-burlitz
uh outfits to provide
education for its students um
it's also going to get rid of the
prohibition
outsourcing more than 50 percent of
their programs to non-accredited
providers
so you basically
[Music]
create a very small university that can
meet accrediting standards
but then 70 percent of your revenue
comes from people at
non-accredited institutions
it also limits things like credit hour
definition
it would let colleges and accreditors
decide on how to evaluate a student's
progress
right they can inflate credit hours they
can charge students significantly more
money
and look a lot of the uh people who sign
up for these colleges
they are not terribly savvy they know
that they're looking around in the job
force and they're seeing people who have
college degrees do better than they're
doing
and they want to um help themselves and
their family
and they don't have the time to go to a
you know a typical um uh college
and so uh you know that's the situation
you have you basically
desperation is great well it's basically
a great market you have the education
uh department basically um just
just uh enabling
con artists here's another one a little
disappointed you'd think that trump
would have cracked down on them just out
of pure spite
because his was sued out of existence in
2010.
he can appreciate it he can appreciate
it listen i can appreciate a good
comment solidarity forever
here you can see the uh um uh prison
stocks
also uh followed a similar trajectory
um where uh trump's win
uh helped the prison stocks private
prisons skyrocket
so yeah well private prisons of course
um
so that's always fun that's another
added bonus
we're gonna see um thousands
of people get saddled with uh student
debt
that in no way is going to help them um
neither as a citizen or
as a uh in terms of return on investment
uh so all right meanwhile let's remember
how
at the end of trump you if i recall the
finance correctly
you get to meet him was one of the
things that you were promised
and you would get a photo next to a
cardboard cutout
right donald trump it's like you could
just pay an appearance fee but
you also have to go through like months
of schooling before you actually get to
but then you don't know but you didn't
meet him
it was literally a cardboard interview
david k johnston no no there was a guy
who worked for trump university oh yeah
that was a ring of fire
i don't know i think we did that at like
at some vacation show
it was sort of uh protected on to
something yeah it wasn't um
my favorite interview but i was curious
to see and i thought maybe people would
find it somewhat worthwhile but this guy
earnestly thought like i was in there to
do good
yeah and then he ended up teaching one
of like the didn't he know more about
real estate than like the teachers
it's some weird some weird i don't know
um
put it on your credit card so let's uh
preview tonight uh shall we
ladies and gentlemen um here is uh chris
wallace
now as you know tonight is premised on
the idea that
there's a national emergency and i think
what's happening in the white house
right now is they're trying to figure
out
what are we going to say is the national
emergency
right it could be that um
well we have a national emergency
because we have 14 000 beds
filled with uh children and we need to
stop the flow of children
unaccompanied uh miners across the
border so we need to
build the wall or it could be we are
afraid that there's another caravan
that is assembling uh 3 000 miles away
and they're starting to jog
and by the time they get here they'll be
running so fast we won't be able to stop
them
or should we just talk about what we've
been talking about for months
which of course is this notion of 4
000 terrorists
would-be terrorists stopped at the
border let's see if that one will float
um send sarah to uh fox news sunday
and see if we can uh if we can do this
because if we can't do it on fox news
we're gonna have some real problems
let's talk let's talk
a look at it across the board let's talk
about the wall because there is no
question
that there has been a big spike in the
number of family units coming across the
border
the president talks about terrorists
potentially coming across the border and
here is secretary of homeland security
nielsen take a look
cbp has stopped over 3 000 what we call
special interest
aliens trying to come into the country
on the southern border
those are aliens who the intel community
has identified
are of concern but special interest
aliens
are just who come from countries that
have ever
produced terrorists they're not
terrorists themselves and the state
department
says that there is quote their words no
credible
evidence of any terrorists coming across
the border from mexico
we know that roughly nearly 4 000
known or suspected terrorists come into
our country illegally
and we know that our most vulnerable
point of entry is at our supreme court i
know the statistic i didn't know if
you're going to use it but i studied up
on this
do you know where those 4 000 people
come or where they're captured
airports not always certainly the state
department says there hasn't been any
terrorists that they found coming across
by land and it's by sea it's all of the
above but one thing that you're
forgetting is that the most vulnerable
point of entry that we have into this
country
is our southern border and we have to
protect it and the more and more
they're not coming across the southern
border they're coming and they're being
stopped
in a number of ways they're certainly
i'm not disagreeing with you that
they're coming through airports i'm
saying that they come by air by land and
by sea
and the more and more that our border
becomes vulnerable and the less and less
that we spend time and money protecting
it
the more that we're going to have an
influx not just of terrorists but of
human traffickers
drug inflow and people that are coming
you know what the most poorest border is
of course
that is the northern border um
that is actually um i think about
three times the length of the southern
border
and then of course um the oceans
when we're talking about by sea yeah we
got to secure our coasts
from all that where's the wall terrorist
pirates
but even on fox news
sarah sanders uh sarah huckabee sanders
gets um
a pie faced and then um we have
nbc news reporting that only six
immigrants
in the terrorism database were stopped
by the
um the cbp that is the
customs and border patrol at the
southern border
in uh 2018. now these are just people
whose names
were on a federal government list
of suspected terrorists and like i say
ted kennedy
was once on that list he was not it
turns out to be a suspected terrorist
um and the you know what constitutes a
suspected terrorist
uh can range from like this person uh
protested against chevron
uh destroying a um you know uh
uh a a forest so um
this is uh an absurd statistic and it's
already been blown
out of the water um
but let's uh let's look into
as we we peruse the uh various
um possible justifications for a
national emergency to be announced
tonight let's look to
fox and friends to see what they're
suggesting
is the national emergency
that we must declare to build
a wall the question is not only of the
drugs that are coming through
not only the potential gang members that
are making their way through
uh there is danger there's also families
and humanitarian aid that's needed at
the border
and then the with the catch and release
in court saying we got to release these
people
and these kids within 20 days they go
into our school system
in our school system last time there was
unaccompanied minors they flooded into
long island
and i want to tell you i can't tell you
how many teachers said their classroom
size doubled
and a lot of them don't speak any
english and suddenly they're trying to
teach kids with other kids who are
paying taxes whose parents are paying
taxes
the same subjects and the other kids
don't speak english so incomes more
teachers
incomes more tax dollars to find those
more teachers the more classrooms
temporary classrooms
and they had no say in what was
happening these people
are now being stacked up at the border
in
makeshift shelters there you go
i don't believe that what don't you
believe
actually literally anything of what you
just well i will tell you this
look there are um 50
million students in public schools um
as of uh the fall of 2018. um
that is i think you know across
both elementary and
high school and every year
every year ladies and gentlemen almost
um
65 000
uh students graduated
um graduate from high school
who are undocumented immigrants and
they're all on long island
uh apparently every single one of them
all sixty five thousand just dollars
just like they're all just like they
cross the border and then all of a
sudden they're just like i wanna go to
the mall
um and of course i wanna go to
huntington
tomorrow the answer on fox and friends
to this problem will be to privatize the
schools and drain money of them and give
it to private schools
so i color me a little bit skeptical
yeah about their concern kill me
complain that they actually got more
funding in teachers
right and but they just couldn't say no
we don't want the more funding
teachers if it means we have to take in
refugees that was precisely the
and can i just just looping back i mean
they were incompetent
and the lies are so extravagant and
ridiculous that she got called out on
fox news but i mean
we should do some fascism minding here
because those are definitely like of the
big lie
varieties like those are not hey let's
massage a statistic and do some spin and
do all this crap that everybody does
of course those are like well
said kristen nielsen that's what i'm
saying statement well no no that's
actually primarily what i'm pointing to
because that sets the whole thing in
motion
but she and huckabee sanders those are
just
those that's fascism it it's incompetent
you know it's fascism so incompetent
that it's not even succeeding in a fox
news segment but
a lot of people laughed at the original
nazis right and they didn't uh
exactly and as ken clippenstein pointed
out hitler you know the reason hitler
rise
rose was because he wasn't fact-checked
in munich enough didn't get enough
whopping
why yeah he didn't get enough but the
truth is like you know that
we got a note that's fascism those are
those are big lies
but it's starting with a grain of truth
right because people know it's in the
air that these are real problems in
schools right class
sizes are too big and they're under
resourced
and then they do a little fascist
misdirection and blame it on the
immigrants
instead of you know the ruling class
indeed right
now here we have uh when we speak of of
fascistic uh lies that are being like
almost a b
tested on fox and friends it seems to me
uh this is um a clip number four they
bring on
brandon judd he is the national border
patrol uh council
i don't know is that the uh is it the
union he's the union right
the union president of the border patrol
and that this union actually is one that
is in favor
of donald trump they all can't be gems
folks
uh sometimes when you have the most uh
backward ass
of uh groups of people they get excited
because they get to knock some heads at
the border
um unions are not good
but uh they brought on fox and friends
this guy
brandon judd and they
brought him on again to a b test
what lie is going to float tonight they
tried the thing about the schools
and you almost heard everybody in the
studio laughing like oh
kill me is worried about public schools
now this is hilarious
uh but here is uh brandon judd
a couple of things that have come out of
homeland security and maybe
the white house communications that
maybe need to be further defined
nbc news heads says this only six
immigrants in terrorism
database stopped by cpb at southern
border
in the first half of 2018. they followed
up on
bigger statistics that were put out by
homeland what's the truth
okay that's absolutely ridiculous to say
that we've only detained six people that
were on the terrorist watch list
we're not going to make that information
known we have to keep that close to our
to to the chest um when you look at
911 all of those people wait a second
i'm confused haven't we heard for weeks
that it was 4 000
but is that part of like a false flag we
put out the four thousand
but it's somewhere between six and four
thousand but we gotta keep this is the
same thing they did with the snowden
revelations we could never
possibly talk about anything to validate
our mass surveillance of americans
because that would jeopardize the whole
thing but they've already put
out all these friends we just heard uh
bridgette miss direction
yeah we're whatever say christian
exactly those those numbers those
numbers are wrong
exactly the lies are for national
security lies are for national security
which is totally not fascist right
do you understand that the numbers
between
six and four thousand because if
the terrorists knew the number was 3387
they would have all our secrets god
we've only detained
six people that were on the terrorist
watch list we're not going to make that
information known we have to keep that
close to our
to to the chest when you look at 911
all of those people that took down the
towers right here in new york city
none of them were on the terrorist watch
list we don't know
um guess what there wasn't
before 9 11.
ice terrace watch list
yeah that's why it was so hard for them
to be on it
we didn't have a time machine right new
york city
none of them were on the terrorist watch
list we don't know who's coming in this
country illegally this again
is illegal immigration it's not legal
immigration
if it was legal they would be presenting
themselves at the porch of entry and we
would know exactly
this is absurd he said that we can't
tell
uh we cannot tell
how many people have been there and
we um because
we'd be revealing secrets but we also
don't know
not to mention there is essentially no
legal
immigration for working class people
i i mean the the bottom line is um
half of supposed uh undocumented
uh immigrants in this country came in
legally and overstayed their visa
uh so he's just
they're just lying uh he's just lying
but we'll see if that one floats
lastly in anticipation of tonight's um
broadcast and we should say about uh
tonight's
um announcement by uh president trump
that president obama wanted to address
the nation
about immigration uh what was this five
years ago for
well i don't even know what the date is
today um and
all the networks said no we're not
interested it's too political
somehow um they have found it within
themselves to
reverse themselves my fellow americans
i'm announcing a complete ban on white
migration to the united states
for too long these male-brained monsters
have emerged from caves and wreaked
havoc
across the globe we can't stop all of
them
but we can make a first step here is
uh lastly the um
nbc national security and justice
reporter julie ainsley
who uh fact-checked mike pence's
interview where he was claiming that
that the the border wall was a national
emergency
and necessity uh on stephanie rule the
caravan that would have arrived
after the election i didn't hear much of
it
showing that this is not about a crisis
it's a political ploy i want you to walk
us through your reporting
because it is so desperately important
as i mentioned conservative americans
like my mom and dad
who watch conservative media outlets are
being lied to
by journalists by the white house when
they're told things like
4 000 terrorists are pouring in
and i want to share a bit of what what
mike pence said when hallie asked him
about it
with regard to terrorists we've seen
more than than
4 000 known or suspected terrorists
attempt to come into our country through
various means but on the southern border
but let me stop you on that number
because it is a misleading claim that's
been fact-checked as i believe you're
aware
because that number is for all ports of
entry including airports well and that's
what i was saying it is from all ports
of entry
but on the southern border last year
alone 3 000
special interest aliens were apprehended
trying to come into our country
okay great so we're having some champion
wordsmithing here julia
walk us through this for those americans
who do want to live in a safe positive
environment and the fear-mongering
that's going on out of our white house
so hallie what we have is a theory that
is being pushed by the administration
that has been fact checked and as we
fact check it they change their talking
points so
you're right leading up to the midterms
is the caravan as we put more fact
checks about who these people
were how they were mainly asylum seekers
and families
they've changed the message now to focus
on terrorism
we heard the message over the weekend
and from sarah huckabee sanders last
week that there were 4
000 we fact checked that and found that
only six
in the first half of 2018 came through
the southern border
more than that came through the northern
border those are people on databases or
what's known as known or suspected
terrorists it doesn't mean that they
are going to be arrested or charged with
a terrorism-related
crime that's a higher bar but these are
people who have names on a database that
are known to the united states and to
our law enforcement officials
now they're changing it again they're
going to an even lower category which
known as special interest
aliens and saying that 3 000 of those
cross the southern border in a year
that may be true that's not data that i
have i'm folk
the data on the six is from the
databases the known and suspected
terrorists but what i will say about
special interest aliens
is they are even further from what we
would categorize as a terrorist
or anyone who would we be able to arrest
or charge
in the united states on
terrorism-related charges these are
simply people who raise a red flag
usually because of their travel patterns
i followed special interest aliens for a
long time
it could be someone who is simply from
india who shows up at the southern
border and they're not sure how they got
there
it's more rare for someone outside of
the western hemisphere to be crossing on
foot that just makes sense if you look
at the map of a world
it is much harder to get in that way
you've already taken a flight so why
wouldn't you just take a flight to the
united states
so they raise a red flag and people do
more and uh
digging on them that doesn't mean that
they raise to the level
of a national security threat all right
now
what's also hilarious about this if you
can click through that link
um this is the homeland security page
that says myth versus fact known and
suspected terrorists
versus special interest aliens
and this is from no this is from
yesterday
they posted this in recent days the term
special interest aliens
and known and suspected terrorists have
become more frequently used as part of
the discussions about the federal budget
and border security
these terms are not synonymous nor
interchangeable
but are two separate terms that are
commonly used in national security
community
to describe different types of potential
threats
there are people in the department of
homeland security who are clearly upset
that not only are they pissed that the
white house is
um conflating these things i think
they're pissed that their own boss is
conflating things
clearly a a different person than the
one who wrote the uh
secret nazi code post yeah exactly
um this is um this is
you know uh we're watching
the entire sort of apparatus of our
government say like
this um announcement tonight is total bs
and and here's the thing that's scary
about it
the media is saying it's total bs the
government broadly speaking is saying
it's total bs
and it's still going to happen and
there's no way to stop it
and that's what's the scary part right
where you start getting into this whole
thing where it's like
you know everybody's going around doing
this or they're like you know
they're like wink wink you know we all
know we pretend to work they pretend to
pay us type of situation
well maybe they're not getting paid
right now and that's why they're
slacking on their white supremacy that
could be it
uh you're gonna want some fake stats to
drum up a fake
crisis to racially scapegoat a group of
minorities to
leverage your authoritarian government
you gotta pay us it's gonna continue
the deep state finally bucks trump
because he's skimping on payments
indeed actually how the deep state would
finally take trump down is when he
finally just gives them like the you did
some renovations in my hotel treatment
exactly my brown uh bearded friend
said the tsa agents didn't even remember
to uh racially profile him on his way
back from uh
they look like they give like a very
like poignant face like
welcome to the country ahmed no i won't
be looking at your bags
you look perfectly fine to me it's a
true story by the way
column from a 602 area code who's this
where you call them from
hey sam it's armand from vietnam or in
vietnam
armand in vietnam what's going on armand
hey guys i sent y'all a pretty
pessimistic email earlier today
um but it had one point that i kind of
want to talk about on the cast
basically i want to talk about uh what
kind of
progress because i'm kind of young and i
don't fully understand what kind of
progress we can expect
in the future assuming everything goes
well um
and also i wanted to really thank you
guys for all your dedicated work in 2018
today i became a majority reporter oh
well thank you kind of
kind of happy and and a point that i
also want to make
is the irony that i feel like we're
going to go through
to correct all of the decisions that the
current administration is making
while at the same time they're just
pretty much correcting
all the decisions that the obama
administration
made
but basically i want to focus on
what can we expect to try and repair
relationships with their allies
and as far as addressing populism in the
u.s
um kind of
let's just do one at a time as far as
repairing our relationships with our
allies what can dems try and do
in the beginning of the next
administration assuming things go well
well i i think i mean
it would be irrational and maybe you
have a better sense of this too being
outside the country
but i think living in the country
we have this perspective of trump is an
anomaly
there was a lot of things uh that went
wrong in this election
that the majority of americans don't
subscribe
to this guy's level of incompetence and
in insanity in in many respects i mean
uh i think um you know
his to the extent that any of it's uh
genuine i don't know but uh obviously
there are people who want less
sort of uh involvement in uh in other
parts of the world
but in terms of just specifically that
narrow question
into how will our allies and and even
those people who are not necessarily our
allies
perceive the united states it would be
irrational for them
to assume everything's
fine with this country even after trump
is gone
you know it's like it is i mean it would
be
just we are not reliable like even and
i listen as far as i'm concerned if i
had a rocket ship
and i could put john bolton and donald
trump into that rocket ship
and send it up into the sky and have it
never return
um or frankly just a paper bag that i
could uh
light on fire i i i i i i there was a
max romeo song called send the devils
like chase the devil to outer space
but bolton is in um
you know syria and turkey and no one's
listening to him
because it doesn't matter what he says
because nobody thinks that
that that our government is operating um
uh properly and you can develop maybe
just like a little bit of confidence
with some measure of
of competence in the future but
the fact is is that the idea that this
country could go from obama
to trump indicates that this country is
unstable
so even if the next president is um
well i mean if it's bernie sanders then
it be you know even looks even more
unstable on some level i guess
you know i mean i guess if you know if
you were to put mike pence in
maybe there would be some notion at
least there's a we we can tell where
these people are going but
we are as a country
politically very unstable and i think
it's going to take generations before we
lose that reputation
i have a slightly even if things change
and
there's no reason why other countries
would um would
would view us consistently enough to
draw any plans
up and around i have a sl i don't know
if it's different but i would just add i
i think that the frame of the question
is a little bit problematic because i
think because of the things sam's
outlining
but also just big picture
it's not going to go back to the way it
was for
reasons also that don't have to do with
trump necessarily
like china occupies a it's kind of a
cliche but it's really true that they
occupy a different place
in the world than they did even during
the last parts of the obama
administration right
so the notion that you'll
have right that's where you would know
this well where you are so it's like
i think that i don't know you know it's
still getting articulated but janis
verafakas when he wrote this piece with
david adler announcing the progressive
international
they basically were like look you have
this global far-right rise
and it is a trend it's united states
brazil
india russia it's brexit france
it's strong in yeah philippines hungary
we know this
and and then there's this craving to
return to this like
previous liberal order and you know
people with a more left perspective
would oppose the liberal order
on a variety of grounds anyways in terms
of you know the substantive merits of
u.s
imperial imperialism frankly but it's
also like it's simply it's not coming
back it's
not how things are designed right now
it's not where the trend lines are going
so we've got to actually really be
thinking collaboratively of
like what the next model is and people
like daniel bessner
arguing that the left model is going to
come from much more sort of peer-to-peer
civil society bottom driven up networks
and i think that that's true and a
better way to think of it than because
the united states but that's
but this is a different question no no
but i'm no no it isn't a different
question because the united states is
not
even with a more credible president and
a more
coherent foreign policy is not going to
occupy
the same place in the infrastructure
that's so
the notion of even just like in the
united states having the credibility to
direct global affairs that way
is not happening it's not coming but
there is but there's even there's a
difference between
not occupying the same relatives and
being such a completely unpredictable
character
that you have to actually like distance
yourself
in a way that you can't even work with
them even in a lesser capacity
right like so that's true you could be
the u.s true that's true in some ways
but also just think of like i mean the
reality is is like
europe still even under trump has to
work with us that's what the
infrastructure is africa
who you know african countries that made
a pivot to
china from the united states or france
that was already happening like
there's just i think very specifically
what you're talking about is really
relevant for something like
the iran deal and the lack of
credibility we have by destroying that
and lying about it
but as an example the fact that trump is
still able to basically terrorize the
europeans and to
by default pulling out of that deal as
well because of sanction
threatening secondary sanctions that
power is diminishing and going away so
china's going to prop that deal up
india is going to prop that deal right
and it's going to just mean a different
way
so i just i'm saying i agree with you i
totally of course the credibility's
the whole playing field is changing and
a president is going to need to
understand that more structurally
yeah but what's nuts to me is that this
is all happening
at the same time that china is doing
projects like the belt and road
initiative
and strategically militarily i mean did
you know
that most of our military communications
to china go through a fax
machine
yes i mean that's just that's and i mean
i'm sourcing this from the economist a
couple weeks ago but that's just
it's nuts to me at a time when we should
be
communicating with china and rather than
that we're
we're starting these these nonsensical
uh
attacks and just well i mean it's fax
machines and that's what it's dairy to
me
that send the jokes all right the fax
machine is the best way to send the
jokes
is my understanding you can do the
pictures
um but i don't want to take up too much
time just uh one more final point i
wanted to make um
is uh as someone who struggles to
describe things that i feel like super
emotional about
i've never heard someone put my feelings
into words uh the way dee did yesterday
i don't know if i'm saying her name
right d and i just like to throw an
extra vote in for her to definitely have
a podcast or at least a blog we can
subscribe to
um but yeah that's all i got guys thanks
so much for the call appreciate the call
thanks sharma i have a question do you
ever think about comparisons to
uh the british empire and the collapse
of it like america is basically the
british empire with a lot more natural
resources
population to china it's like weird
because
yeah and the difference is as far as i
understand that i think the baton from
the
british to american empire is like the
only time that hasn't happened violently
right
so people need to think a lot more
carefully about how this transition is
happening
wide angle like i always take the wide
angle view on things generally but
uh if you think about neo-liberalism
not just as an ideology but as a period
within capitalism
it's very clear that this particular
phase
is just about over it is reaching a
crisis point
um and we're going to transition to a
new phase
maybe of capitalism maybe of
post-capitalism
but until that happens you're gonna see
a lot more chaos
as don't know what's going to come well
i think what's really
and and crisis and trump is the result
of crisis as is the wave of right-wing
populism around the world
well it's kind of scary though i mean
all of that is scary but i think like
like china has an authoritarian
capitalist model that has a
huge amount of roadway ahead of it so i
think these contradictions are reaching
a
point faster in places that are already
developed china has a lot of room
to develop essentially fascism if you
really think about what they're
doing i could see a world that's a
hybrid of amazon and the people's
republic of china oh yeah everyone
thinks that china is communist
no what china shows us is that
capitalism
and democracy do not need to come in the
same package exactly
right right call them from a 647 area
code who's this where you come from
hey this is ashland calling from canada
uh who is it
ashton sebastian sebastian hey
so are you actually uh going to run on a
libertarian ticket
um i i don't know i mean i you know the
idea came up a couple of days ago so i
haven't really had um
a full time to talk to my family about
it
is it safe to say that you're sort of in
the exploratory committee phase
uh i think i'm in the whole show has
just kind of been leading up to that
well that's possible uh i'm i like to
think of myself in the pre-exploratory
i'm exploring the exploratory face
all right well i wanted to offer you uh
just a little bit of advice
uh on how you should do this and tell me
if you think it
makes any sense i think
that you should describe yourself on
twitter
as the last libertarian and you should
go about this from a kind of like
left-wing libertarian
you know perspective and go like i don't
know if you know anything about
uh political terminology in europe right
where the
the word democrat means right wing and
then libertarian is like a sort of
socialist anarchist
yes yes we've had that has come up on
again
don't tell me about it
but anyway yeah you should try to you
should try to do like the reverse date
reuben
yes i think that's like i i think we
would have to
if i was going to uh run and uh i will
um you know like i say i have to consult
with my family
uh but then it would be we would
probably have to sort of reverse
engineer
a slight um uh change in perspective
but i also sort of am am
um intrigued by the notion of
just saying i'm a libertarian without
having to do any of that other work
that you're talking about and just go up
and maintain my exact same politics
uh and uh my exact same branding
as it were and um
you know maybe i could say i'm the new
libertarian
uh or the or the last neo libertarian
neo-libertarian i'm just interested in
ideas
things happen at the idea exactly but i
mean that's
that's the thing with these guys right
is like there's like they always claim
no i'm not
that kind of libertarian i'm just that's
right yes that's true
remember greg that's true remember that
i i don't want to conjure his name right
but do you remember like i am with this
no i think that's consequential
post-textual period can you play the
military i do
talk for four robbers please i do like
the idea sebastian of
of saying um that i am just interested
in exploring
libertarian ideas uh and so that
in the event that i am kept out of the
debates i can
um wait for my friends in the idw
to uh protect my my rights to
examine the ideas uh gregory i
i appreciate the call greg would be like
i may um uh
consequence libertarian and uh uh
i agree with you that the uh ukrainian
plane that was shot out of the sky was
probably not the false flag it was
probably done by militias and you'd be
like oh okay greg
but my problem with you is there is a
technology in singapore that could bring
all of those people back to life
through nanotechnology and i'm wondering
why you opposed that because you oppose
libertarian
ideas okay he would always call it the
best like
the solution to jordan and lebanon this
you could put
palestine in yeah wait what was it just
palestine in jordan if we
we made driverless cars
and you had them go back and forth on
the border of the west bank
so there's real security concerns for
israel but here is my solution
what if you gave palestinian children
ipad
and they could take khan economy classes
this is a solution why can't no please
please can i have another
45 minutes
by the way you're welcome i think i
bullied greg off the show
jonathan armstead jonathan armstead sam
i think you're on to something with your
take the
right-wing media looks to constantly
attack young progressive women
the aoc article about her going by sandy
was beyond the pale but there's a
history to this whether it's ruby
bridges
maya lynn being attacked for creating
the vietnam war memorial your friend
janine
sandy flake or teen vodka lauren laura
duka
old white dudes seem to get their
jollies off on attacking these women
it's like that scene of the hunger games
where donald sutherland says to
says of jennifer lawrence's character
that she became a beacon of hope for the
rebellion and she has to be eliminated
like i always say
life imitates sci-fi there is no doubt
in my mind
that for right-wing media beating up on
young
women is a ratings winner
and here is rush limbaugh
um basically saying hey sam
i see your point and i'm going to raise
it uh
one unit speaking of that it has become
apparent to me
that pelosi and schumer do not like
alexandria ocasio-cortez if you noticed
cnn chris saliza our old buddy chris
formerly of the washington post the
problem with this is like
somehow rush did not get the memo like
he's like
look that might be good for you you
youngins
to say that she doesn't have uh the
credibility and she's sandy
but my peeps my peeps still
get just disgusted at the idea
that they would actually have to press
number two for english
on their phones so i'm going to remind
you that
cortez
cnn chris salisa our old buddy chris
formerly of the washington post now
overseas and has just
written a devastating piece
about alexandria ocasio-cortez
saying she doesn't know what she's
talking about saying she's
she's dead wrong about everything she
has no facts
she poses a great there's no question
that that piece
is the product of pelosi and schumer
working the media
because i'm telling i predicted this
that the democrat leadership
is not hip to this young bunch of
millennials pouring in here
and some of these other radicals they're
not hip to it i mean they run that party
and they run the american left and i
gotta let some young uppity come in here
and upset the apple cart it's like
anybody else that holds power
they're not just gonna seed it c-e-d-e
for those even real living not gonna
seed it to a bunch of newcomers who
don't know what they're doing
he's not wrong uh i mean he may
think he's actually correct about some
of those dynamics well
i would imagine most people don't like
to give up their power
most people don't like the idea of you
know a
junior backbencher essentially
becoming the probably the single most
um popular political figure
in the country i mean not just their
power like their political alignment
because she is trying to realign the
party yeah i
i suspect that
um they have
less invested in the
ideology than they do in the idea that
they're going to lose power
well not just the ideology but like you
know the people who pay the money
all the right it's just your niche it's
just papers like if she'd come in
and she was a rock star and just i don't
know what the ideology would be but
she was the the you know attracting the
same
amount of of
interest and somehow was a
i don't know well there's a bit of a
wrinkle in this right like i'm somewhere
in between
both of you on this because i think
obama shows
[Music]
both of what you're saying so on one
hand where i think you're right sam's
like obviously
obama came in and the establishment was
mostly
totally enthusiastic and excited and
very thrilled that this promising
charismatic young person was
changing the party right and then
obviously the clinton people hated him
because he threatened their power and it
wasn't in any way an ideological battle
there wasn't much daylight at all
um but conversely i would say that you
know you wouldn't have gotten
like the tom daschles of the world
wouldn't have broke
for obama and harry reid wouldn't have
been so gung-ho about him running for
president
if he also had say a significantly more
leftward agenda it was because of that
lack of ideological daylight definitely
that they felt
comfortable realigning it because it
didn't jeopardize
the campaign contributions and the
ideology didn't realign
at all like it's not like obama came in
and severed their connections to wall
street well no it did real
well it realigned the dynamics of the
leadership of the party and patronage
networks which is what you guys were
talking about to some extent right so
that's why i'm somewhere in the middle
of it of this conversation i think she
rep my point is
she's got the obama thing in terms of
she's charismatic she's great
blah blah blah but she also represents
like
just even a complete repudiation of
clinton and to a significant extent the
obama administration
that does implicate the ideology of it
potential patronage
uh network uh you know for lack of a
better term
just simply does not align with anybody
who's in power now
so it's very hard to sort of and that is
um
probably a function of ideology uh but
it's conceivable to
imagine a you know like uh
like a you know nato like or well no but
i'm saying like a trump in the
republican world where it's like
he wasn't going to come in and do
anything politically that was really
going to be just
he was completely outside in terms of
the patriot network
which is why he represented a threat to
them even though i
you know ideologically it's funny the
closest analog to the democratic party
maybe would be bloomberg like he would
bring in his own people
maybe because he's got his i doubt it i
don't think that there's an
an analog to trump in the democratic
party i don't think that exists no
despite some op-eds i may have seen
today
saying exactly that what's that calling
aoc the trump of the left
well of course well those yeah those are
just the typical idiots who
write those op-eds they're just
brain-dead secret identity politics two
things
isn't there a possibility that the
supreme court does a bush v gore and
says trump can have
the wall but don't use this as a
precedent in the future unless it
benefits republicans
yeah of course but i don't think these
cases are going to come up i mean
frankly this is what i think is going to
happen
he's going to announce that he's going
to make the wall
and they're just going to slow walk it
they're just going to slow walk it
because they don't care about making the
wall
they just want to say that they're
making the wall
um as for gerrymandering all the
republicans i know really like the
system where their votes count more than
everybody else's they're a-holes who
argue in bad faith i live in ohio i
don't see a way to beat them
these republicans trying to talk about
terrorists coming over the border sound
like me when i'm trying to confuse my
boss
very legal and very cool um
this is good uh bill de blasio
just announced that health care will be
guaranteed
for all residents in new york city i
don't know how he plans
undocumented including uh 300 000
undocumented immigrants
so that was a that was a i
feeling feeling good about voting for de
blasio moment
this is the music for the feelings
what's trump going to call him when he
runs for president
dumb beanstalk guy jack in the dumpster
thank you
jack and the dumb stock uh frankenstein
frankenstein frankenstein de blasio
actually
is apparently going to new york in
mid-january
for a nomikee fundraiser maybe invite
him to guest on the show i'd love him
to soak up a little socialist world view
while he's visiting i will
of course uh
what sell up what's aleppo uh could you
please give your argument for why
taxation is not theft
thanks love show um property is theft
boom i mean said your mom
it's um it's not theft
because um it is
taxes i mean like i don't know how else
to tell you that like
you could define you know it is um
the the government giveth
and the government taketh away it's not
like
uh what you have is not a function
of the society as it exists um
when you were born into it you know
their property is
simply a um
a a construction of
the state we know this because there are
property-less societies or there have
been
and so um the state
basically says we're going to enforce
your property rights
but the get i mean that's the give
and the get is you're also going to
support
the um the state and in its um
uh it's it's monopoly of force
yeah it's a protection racket so they
should probably take the deal that
they're offered
because the other deal is not as
favorable for them
right like the bourgeois state was
founded to
uphold property rights and capitalism
and in exchange you know they have to
give
at least some small amount back in taxes
that the government then redistributes
well
the the the other issue is that without
the taxes
the money you have would be worthless do
you want to is it
would you do your life it's less
sophisticated but i mean as you describe
it it's like
do you think there's some way in which
it's if you
if we exist because of all of these
things that the government provides the
whole context
that you always say like what about the
roads that we get to uh
you know our free exchange of ideas on
or whatever
i mean in some ways it's almost
analogous to saying like is it theft to
have to like pay for the coffee that you
just got
in a way like it's just like it's you're
just paying for a service that's been
provided for you
all out of sight right i don't i mean
kind of that's kind of how i
and and you do have a choice you can
leave
the country yeah i mean you could live
totally off
well the slightly different wrinkle i
was going to say is is it's to the
extent that it is theft it's because the
government isn't democratically
legitimate right right that's true
that that is right that's a good point
is it theft when you uh
create a surplus that your boss then
takes away
and uses for their own uh profit
accumulation anybody asking this
question wouldn't agree with that but
you know
but uh that is true well this is why i
kind of like the i am that framed it in
the sense of taxes because that's
something that uh
right wingers might understand a little
better the uh i remember a uh
hardcore libertarian upstate to me i was
buying a peach tree from him uh which of
course was not a non-hybrid
peach tree uh and um he uh looked at my
car
uh which was a uh i think a 2002
subaru and uh he said uh is that your
car
and i said yeah he said do you own it
i'm like yeah and he goes no you don't
you just lease it from the state i'm
like what
he goes yeah you uh you lease it from
the state it's registered uh the state
that just registered to you i'm like
okay
really that says something i was like no
because obviously you'd be the
the one in one million oh really no no
how about we spend the rest
of the day hashing that out i was like
i'll leave my daughter at no
problem i'd like uh i'd like my peach
tree and to go
now please well that's the healthy point
that
like look theft involves stealing
something without or taking something
without someone's permission
and the the point is is that um the
the money is not yours
it the the money is not yours
the government makes it and says you can
use this
to uh exchange things and we give it
value
you don't want you don't listen if you
have
no american dollars
guess what you don't have to pay a tax
on it
if you don't use american dollars
you do not have to pay tax to the us
government
you can you won't be able to buy
anything here
but you won't have to pay tax it's just
that you're getting to use
american dollars and
there there's a there's a uh you know
there's a what do you call that when you
go on a website right like uh
you're agreeing to our terms that's
basically it you've given your consent
well to be fair you really can't opt out
of the system
but that's the same thing that i would
say to libertarians
when they tell me that i can just opt
out of capitalism like
okay i guess i could starve to death but
that's not a very good
option you you could opt out um
at least of the american system
is there a place in the world i could go
to where i don't have to sell my labor
in order to survive
no i'm talking about if you don't want
to pay taxes to the us government
well yeah i don't know that there's a
place where you couldn't do where you
could get away with
depends what lifestyle you want um
i mean i stipulate that this is a peach
tree
sam when it comes to terrorists uh the
important question is which is greater
six or zero
usa in the uk
sam i've changed my tyt subscription to
a majority report subscription loving
you all well we're going to give you one
of these
i'm an american in the uk trump is hated
here and worried about the state of
america
uh don't blame you adam kochhed is there
a way that trump can build the wall
do you think ann coulter and rush see
the writing on the wall and are trying
to find a way to explain their audiences
that they are ditching trump it's an
unreasonable demand no
they're not going to do trump letter
carrier
sam there's an elephant in the room uh
vis-a-vis sunday coming from new england
and you cho
i know i wasn't gonna bring this up
coming up from new england and chose
halfway through
a uh tfb uh playoff game to have your
event will you be giving patriot scoring
updates throughout the show well
you've given up the ghost but yes i will
be i will be actually flashing the
patriots on the screen
um we have a special gosh i hope they
lose so much
oh my god i hope that we get like we
have to announce that tom brady's acl is
missing
[Music]
tom brady got significant brain damage
it
um well i guess in the yeah logitech he
definitely got brain damage and is
getting it yes
it's a problem with the with a potential
guest
we're not gonna really have uh not gonna
be guest heavy on this show but i'm not
gonna be there
gronk was supposed to be there yeah
gronk was supposed to be there
[Laughter]
bill belichick was going to come and
apologize for supporting donald trump
but uh he had a backup
jj i didn't like what he said about
lebron
um jj cool i love jamie and don't want
to get you off track but i have one
question
in an anarchical society who
mediates disputes and upholds the rules
community councils
also i i'm not a full-on anarchist i
just want to make that clear i'm a
communist with anarchist characteristics
so i'm not against some kind of like
federation
of these you know various local
government communities there's some
things that need to be done on a global
level like you know climate standards
etc
i think most uh people who hang out on
my end of the spectrum
would be cool with something like that
so how is that
terribly different from what we have now
uh you don't have capitalism no okay all
right but in terms of the system of
government
oh i mean could you take over the u.n
with communists
make that really powerful somehow hmm
i'm going to take some notes on that
that's what they were i'm not talking
about the economic system i'm talking
about the
the political system the governing the
political system i i would like to see
it um
less centralized but but sure there are
definitely some similarities
rep i'm not against representative
government i just i would go with the
noom chomsky line
of anyone claiming a right to some kind
of power
or state power needs to justify that
claim
and remain accountable to the people who
put them there
that guy's such a poser john
john cleveland the segment with
millhiser was very depressing
uh speaking of someone living in a crazy
gerrymandered state how
do you and the team personally deal with
feelings of hopelessness in these trying
times
uh feels like the slight optimism of
winning the house is uh
petering you out a bit um what i try to
do
is get two hours of sleep a night that's
the way i deal with it uh
and then i come in and i take a nap for
20 minutes in the morning
i get like six and game a lot there you
go i
i do really think it's important to do
other things that are outside of
politics the extent you can
friends family books whatever sports
whatever
i exercise helps a lot legitimately
well i find not sleeping is uh really
the uh
for me bravo matic any drinking game
phrases for tonight's 30 minutes of hate
other than wall perhaps
slats or invasion ms-13 the
the thing is tonight is not going to be
fun because it's all going to be written
and you know stephen miller is going to
write something uh horrific
and that's basically it it's not going
to be fun
let's go to the phones call them from a
702 area code who's this where are you
calling from
hey sam can you hear me i can hear you
who is this
hey it's bro flamingo from las vegas how
you doing uh bro flamingo pretty good
how you doing
i'm all right happy new year by the way
you too
um i just got a couple of things to say
uh the first one is
this is kind of neither here nor there
but i'm sure you guys saw after the
weekly standard got closed down and you
know
what i really found interesting about
this was you know when i was founding
out something closed down you know bill
crystal was whining and stuff
and you had a kind of the quote unquote
liberal establishment media type talking
about oh
well you know the moderate voices of
republicanism is closing their mouth
yeah exactly and you know
thank you thank you by the way but um
you know and
unfortunately i'd have my air sickness
bag on standby but what a lot of people
don't realize
is that well people in the know do but
you know the weekly standard was
basically what was it coke money that
basically funded this or
you know basically like just you know
the neocon types literally just propping
this paper up
you know and and the weekly standard was
basically i guess
like one of the worst welfare to work
schemes i've ever read in on the planet
so you know it's just like it was very
very sickening just to see all this
stuff and it's just you know this is why
i listen to you guys because
it's like man are you kidding me and
i think a lot of people you know and
what's really interesting about this is
that
trump is so bad i mean let's be clear
he's horrible but
you know i i look at the media and you
always see these types like oh well you
know
at least in george w bush's days you
know it wasn't like this whatever i mean
george w bush was awful oh he was just
so
awful but he had a certain degree of
class
okay michelle obama the butterfinger
and you're telling me that doesn't make
your heart move it was an american
and um but basically you know i i really
saw that
and you know i just really feel like you
know
people from like the new york times
stuff like that i would really really
really respect these guys more even the
cable news outlets
you know instead just putting on the
negative net never trumpers because you
know they have no constituency
these guys have no constitution
whatsoever also
also what the ad i mean with the avid of
paul ryan finally stepping down whatever
sam i think it's kind of clear don't get
me wrong the background players are
still there
but the lip service to you know balanced
budgets and you know conservatism and
this type of third that's finally gone
out the window
because to truth be told ryanism had no
constitutional constituency either
none but but i i am not convinced
that every single part of
what we knew as the republican party
three years ago can't come back
literally overnight literally overnight
i i mean i i you know like i just i i it
it won't be the same you know things
won't be the same just simply because
there was a because i think of
the younger generation and um
the at least a portion of the left was
moving more left
anyways but you know in july
or june of of 2016
i was saying you know if donald trump
wins we're all going to have to like
jonathan chait
again and i i was wrong about that
in so far as um
those people did not main you know get
the prominence it ended up being the
never trumpers
right like we have to like john kasich
is a really serious guy
you know like i'm sorry john kasich is a
right-wing right-winging
lunatic and it's just that he happens to
be not trump
bill crystal is you know was
cheerleading war crimes
literally cheerleading war crimes um
and uh those people you know
the the mainstream has a certain amount
of respectability the difference
that exists now as opposed to let's say
the bush era
is just that the the left was growing
since really 08 and um and there is
just simply another sort of slice
of the media culture i think in part
because of technology too
frankly um right so that
but to your point though sam i think
when you guys mentioned this before
you know what i'm saying and it bears
mentioning again where
the media is desperately
desperately looking for some
quote-unquote normal republicans just
you know to get back to the status quo
absolutely without a doubt i appreciate
the comment
yes sir right um and and this is what i
mean by
technology the left is helped by
the technology that we have had the the
far right is too
on some level but the left is helped
much more
because um there was never going to be
a um
a uh an ability for the left to get
on broadcast media or bigger
media platforms you just there just
wasn't
uh not because of the audience but
because of
the the economics of it
um we see examples all the time
and this is the the fundamental people
mistake that people make about
ratings and whatnot people think if it
gets ratings it necessarily
airs and that is not the case
that is not the case um
you can look at what happened in msnbc
and ratings were
um was sort of like a um
were inhibiting what i think um
they wanted to do high ratings were
inhibiting what they wanted to do
um so the
the the technology i mean just imagine
this the the trump world
i mean it really is just what happened
during bush but imagine this
world now where there is no twitter
there is no youtube there is no
um there is no mechanism
to uh you know for people to hear
shows like this or the anti-fatah or the
michael brooks show or these other
there's no mechanism
that's what it was like during the bush
administration youtube was
you know it was started in 2004.
there were some really good scenes
though that you could get if you went to
these
very specific places and there were
blogs but but that was basically it i
mean
it's it's almost impossible to imagine
but now there's like an
entire culture that you could
consume media every day 24 hours a day
and not have to come across anybody
who is crediting bill crystal
as b but that was literally impossible
uh 15 years ago yeah they say
podcasts are the new left-wing talk
radio
yeah i mean i think that's true i think
youtube has the opportunity for that as
well
um but there was you know until
air america there was really no
opportunity for it and it was
also i think you know too late in a
contracting industry
with people who are too stupid to
understand what the where where the
the value proposition was um
this is the literally this is what you
would have seen now i don't know that
you would have had
frankly aoc without the the new
technology
that we have now frankly you the
you know the desire for such type of
politics was there
but you wouldn't have had uh aoc but if
you did
by some fluke of the imagination
who would the left voices be on
television
it would be whoopi goldberg
it would be whoopi goldberg and that
would be it that would be the one that
the left got
that voice and here is what the left
i mean air quotes would be saying just
imagine there was
no other place to respond to this
warren for the democratic to be the
people
let me let me just say this about
ocasio-cortez
she just got in on thursday she was
sworn
in yes and she's very opinionated which
we like we like opinionated women
but it is very very difficult
when people make accusations where you
say you know the
democrats have have done nothing that
they've the
establishment of the democrats have done
nothing and i just want to throw this
out to you
um john lewis oh yeah
wasn't sitting still right um
dianne feinstein wasn't sitting still
there are a whole bunch of people in the
democratic party
who have been busting their asses to
make sure
that women get what they need
people get with any children get what
they need so and
you just got in there and i know you got
lots of good ideas
but i would encourage you to
sit still for a minute and learn the job
and you know and just
you know because there are people in
that party who have been working their
tails off
for they know they know a lot and they
know a lot could
and you could learn some stuff from them
and
i just feel like you know you don't have
to be
born into it you don't have to know it
when you step out but
before you start pooping on people and
what they've done
you got to do something too well she
hasn't done that that's well
very well said very well said it's funny
that she brings up john lewis because i
imagine
when john lewis before he was a
congressman had some critique
of what was going on in government and
had some critique
of what the democratic party was doing
uh in fact
i would imagine there is a whole host
of activists and community leaders
and um uh protesters who have critiques
of of of what democrats
uh and republicans or any uh parties uh
any members of any party where our
government is doing
and i have a strong suspicion that
whoopi goldberg
well i don't know but um
i'd be curious as to what whoopi
goldberg would have said
50 years ago when john lewis uh
part of the civil rights movement is
critiquing what's going on with the
government
i mean you know like the um
this is this is the old this is the olds
just
protecting their turf and
uh the idea that anybody would be like
you're hurting the feelings of dianne
feinstein
are you serious really
but again 15 years ago that's
that's what you would hear from the
nominal left
well it's also the rich defending their
turf right
i i think that's part of it i don't
think whoopi goldberg is afraid of her
uh money being ex-appropriated i think
in her mind
it really is more just
feeling um it's
i think it's generational i mean she or
to the extent that it is
cultural and maybe informed by having
money in that respect
it um accelerates the process
of being old and not just her having
money but like
what are major networks willing to pay
you to say you know there's certainly a
range there that doesn't go that far to
the left there's nothing that whippy
goldberg couldn't say on that show about
aoc i mean she couldn't maybe swear but
there's she couldn't say
there's no i have there's not a moment
where i would think that if whoopi
goldberg
said aoc is great the democrats need to
get on the ball
i agree with everything she says times
three
that she would not hear from anybody at
the network about that no way it just
doesn't happen
like on a show like that they're not
there's nobody at abc going like
whoopi you're getting a little bit out
of control it's more just like
she's just you know swims in that ocean
and sort of self-selecting too yes
you'd select yourself out of it if you
if she was in the habit of making
but i don't think that there's anything
that's going to be said on the view
that is going to in some way raise the
um uh
you know the concerns of you know i
don't know that you could get somebody
you know
jamie i don't think that you would get
offered a job on the view god damn it
but that was my plan but but if you uh
if whoopi goldberg called you up and
said jamie tell me what to say tomorrow
and you said it and she said it all
uh i don't think she would feel in the
slightest bit uh
her job be threatened that'd be pretty
cool
whoopee my lines are open there you go
um i wonder if
uh uh whoopi goldberg would have a
problem with
um reverend barber um
criticizing what's going on in the uh
the senate in the house well we also
have to look back in time right because
this kind of
culture has an end and it clearly is
ending in its hegemony it also had
it had a beginning i i'm still i am
fully on board with my theory about the
generational uh that that that is one of
the big
movers here i'm i'm quite i mean every
day that passes i get more yeah
but you want to look back before the
neoliberal era i mean
eugene debs ran for president and people
reported on that
seriously the overton window has moved
so far to the right
um we got a lot of work to do but i
think the left now
like this especially the generation of
millennial leftists or whatever have
much more in common
with the old left like the labor left of
the 30s than the new left of the 60s
here is um
i guess he's a bishop now william barber
uh critiquing mitt romney's
uh op-ed wherein mitt romney says that
donald trump is rude but i love his
policies
the problem with what romney is saying
is basically saying i disagree
with the moral way trump is saying
things
and if you look at the scriptures look
at jesus the prophets
uh they weren't they didn't criticize
people based on what they
said they criticized them based on what
they did you know jesus talked about
uh the spirit of the lord's upon me to
preach good news to the poor he said woe
unto those religious and political
leaders who leave undone the weightier
matters of the law
which are justice and mercy and
faithfulness and love
isaiah said war unto those who legislate
evil and rob the poor of their rights
so romney in essence is saying if he was
just nicer with his words
i'm still in agreement with his policies
and that's dangerous because
there were nice slave holders with their
word they were nice segregationists
there were
nice people that held women back during
the days that women didn't have the
right to vote
there were dr king got a nice letter
when he was in the birmingham jail
and people said you know if you would
just be nice and wait
and but dr king said i'm not talking
about that i'm talking about policies
and so it's concerning trump is engaged
in
mother child killing policy immigration
policies
romney said isn't against that he's
engaged in mother child family
killing uh health care denial
that's policies and so you can be nice
all you want
we don't just need a kind of gentler
meanness
we need the policies to stop so for one
hand for you to say
i disagree with this word but on the
other hand i agree with this
immoral wall and immoral immigration
policy
it's anemic it's void of any power and
it actually in some ways
more dangerous because i actually would
rather trump be honest about where he is
on policy
than for somebody to smile and say
be nice but still agree with the
negative policies
all right we got time for uh
[Music]
one more call call them from a 2-1-0

all right folks uh apologies people are
hanging on uh
gonna do a couple ims and then uh
skidats
um
let's see a little gleason aoc was
second in a global science fair in high
school just like palin what
aoc was talking about a more
conservative version of the tax system
between fdr and reagan
is the same as uh not being able to name
a newspaper oh this is
uh a max boot god will you pull up this
dumbass thing
look i told you like you know look
these people are worthless
there is no value to them and and the
problem is
is that those people who have platformed
these never trumpers
i'm not saying that they should be uh
you know taken out and flogged i'm just
saying
let them find their own constituency
let them actually bring something to the
table
all they're doing is they are
using your platforms
your praise your retweets
whatever it is to
launder republican talking points
into your networks
aoc shouldn't approach her facts the way
trump does that's just absurd
that's just absurd max mood
ocasio-cortez reminds me of sarah palin
i wonder why that might be
oh they're both women of course
another talented young communicator who
made a big splash in national politics
before before having her lack of
knowledge painfully exposed
the this is stunning
this is stunning
washington post i mean the the way it
gets by an editor is by everybody who
clicked on max boot when he said like i
just found out the republicans are
racist
i in 10 years max boot is going to be
like i look back on those times that i
thought aoc was the same as sarah palin
and i realized like
i was hoodwinked
give me a break i mean
just this is so disingenuous there's no
possible way there's no possible way
someone who would be able to work a word
processing program could
say that there is anything even remotely
similar
between sarah palin and
aoc other than the fact that
[Music]
they're both women they're involved in
politics
sarah palin her national uh
prominence was because john mccain
plucked her out of literally nowhere
as a way of placating a
uh a base that did not like john mccain
that's why sarah palin got prominent
aoc did not have a crane
she did not she represents
a portion of the base of the democratic
party
but um they do both represent a kind of
populism though right
i mean i guess like right is right-wing
populism populism some people say that
it's not it's all phony but i feel like
we need to take it seriously
on its terms well i guess if right-wing
populism leads you to become
a tv star and go around and exploit
people for talking fees
uh but that's the only sort of populist
vision that sarah palin uh
represented as far as i can tell i mean
what you know like to the extent that
she had
any populist fervor it lasted for three
months
and then she quit her job yeah the
reason right-wing populism is scary is
mainly a function of
right-wing elitism willing to use
right-wing populism
yeah but i mean let's be clear on on
sarah palin's moment
like when she was actually doing
something
she was she quit her job
five months after the losing the
election she quit her job midway through
her term
because she claimed that she could do
more
for the republicans by not being in
office
this is a con man or con woman
to be fair that is a grift that is
there's nothing else involved in that
that is a
grift
and the idea with that type of hindsight
with that knowledge that you have of her
trajectory in her career
you would have to think that aoc is
completely disingenuous
and that there's some huge market for
her
in the future riding the wave of
no maybe there is maybe she will quit
her job
maybe in six months she will announce i
can do more
for the left by not being a
congresswoman
and go out on a speaking tour and do a
reality show
and then slowly fade from the public eye
and if that happens
then maybe max boot could re-um
re-up his story i do think we are gonna
keep seeing more of this though from
both the center left
and the center right equating the
quota far left with the far right
absolutely and saying we need to beat
down populism at all costs to continue
this dying neoliberal world order i mean
we just saw i don't think they'll say
the
last part that gives up the game a
little bit too much well we'll see
we just saw nira tandon give like tons
of money to
a think tank run by charles murray right
to uh specifically figure out ways to
know
but he was they they funded charles
murray
right wing and bitter clean and proud
clingers
there's that effective communicator spay
f
uh it's not only scarborough yesterday
whoopi goldberg oh yeah there we go
gregory from oklahoma sam you need to
run for president as a libertarian in
2020 it would be funny to have you on
that debate stage
and then later have people call into the
show saying they were libertarians
before they saw you debate the feel of
candidates in 2022 you need to run for
senate against schumer because he's
trash and i know you'd beat him
well well you had me uh communist dog
hey juboy
today's my 65th birthday happy medicare
for me enjoying the american socialism
i'll give you one of these uh in the
sticks
i'm a montana resident there are places
in northern montana you have to be
careful if hunting because you know very
easily shoot an animal in canada and not
know my
ex's family own a farm that abuts the
border it's literal barbed wire fence
not ten
uh feet talk uh but a normal cow fence
lead me the trump administration thinks
americans don't understand how airports
work
politics drawn poorly post 911 my
co-worker scott smith
was regularly pulled aside at an airport
security for additional screening
apparently his name was considered so
generic that had been added to the watch
list as a possible alias for terrorists
trying to sneak into the country uh
louis
77 it shocked me to find out that sarah
huckabee is the same age as my wife my
wife looks young enough to have a racist
aunt who looks like sarah
dankelicious speaking about long island
recently a student at huntington high
school had
claimed asylum was deported because
police officer at the school thought he
was part of ms-13 because he wore blue
shoes oh that's lovely
uh wolverine 911 hijackers crossed in
canada fyi
i don't think that's true oh oh legally
crossed
there was a millennium bomber that was
in 2000 was caught at the canadian
border
uh buried weiss happy hundredth
anniversary the great boston molasses
disaster maybe i'll die
surrounded by such sweetness psychedelic
quaker
would you agree that in the context of
the democratic primary in the debates
that more progressive voices the better
yes
blacks at least early on
black marxist do you think trump will be
dangerous in 2020 if triangulated into a
tucker collision policy
on policy with dems having the house
conceivable
yes i just don't think that he'll be
able to do that
no if if he's able to pair some sort of
like
right wing social democracy with
all of the other stuff he's got going on
he will be
unstoppable but that's not going to
happen oh yeah i would agree i agree
with that
colleen uh does this thing work as sam
ever online
even sending message to the live show is
it worth making getting a twitter
account
p.s i would have discovered mr if sam
didn't go on msnbc so there's a point to
having him do so thank you colleen
we got two more met a flight the
collapse of the brodish uh
the british empire took two world wars
and long decline u.s looks more like an
ancient
regime france or tsarist russia notable
that both france and russia were both
conservative bulwarks
and the final i am of
the day also the french revolution
started off as law fair
hmm
