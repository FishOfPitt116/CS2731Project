foreign
so obviously the
bigger story uh today is the uh story
revolving around what's happening with
um
two congresswoman uh
Rashida Talib and Elon Omar who have
been banned from Israel apparently this
morning or uh later or earlier I should
say
this morning in terms of U.S time uh the
Israeli government said that Talib could
go and visit her grandmother who is in
her 90s uh but in a very narrow
circumstances and
um
in a way that is disregards her status
as a U.S congresswoman
and
um
I mean you I think it's
it's easy to get bogged down in the uh
the supposed you know politics going
back and forth on this but when you step
back
the implications of this are pretty
stunning
it's understandable I would think that
some countries would
ban
U.S lawmakers from visiting
we have some hostile relationships with
some countries
um it is
understandable I guess on some level
you know broadly speaking if a country
did not have good relations with us as
to why they would ban it I mean that
seems quite obvious we ban probably
officials uh from Iran or from North
Korea but that is not the relationship
that we have with Israel
um
here is Bernie Sanders
saying what is
both stunningly obvious
and
because of the nature of our politics in
this uh country going to be deemed as
being somewhat controversial but this is
the most obvious response that one could
possibly give to this situation play
this uh Senator good to see you uh
what's your reaction to president Trump
asking the president of Israel Benjamin
Netanyahu to do this and Netanyahu
obliging
well I wish I could tell you Ali that I
am shocked uh I am not we have a
president who tragically is a racist uh
is a xenophobe and who is a religious
bigot but the idea that a member of the
United States Congress cannot visit a
nation which by the way we support to
the tune of billions and billions of
dollars is clearly an outrage and if
Israel doesn't want members of the
United States Congress to visit their
country to get a first-hand look at
what's going on and I've been there many
many times but if he doesn't want
members to visit maybe he can
respectfully decline the billions of
dollars that we we give to Israel
yeah I mean but but honestly I mean
think about 100 right
think about the outrage there would be
if
um
I don't know Egypt
said we're going to
ban entry from
a couple of Republican lawmakers or how
about more the point two Jewish
lawmakers right right
I mean that would be
um
stunning
and and and the idea that I mean look
is there absolutely
uh no strings attached to having
relations with you with with it with the
United States
to having diplomatic relations
is there absolutely no strings attached
to the billions of dollars that we use
to support Israel I mean this is it's
pretty outrageous and of course
um it was encouraged by Donald Trump
we'll talk more about this with Ben
Dixon but um I just have to sorry I'm
sorry
um uh just real quick I I you know every
time I see this is another time again
where it just really needs to be
underlined that Bernie is by far the
clearest and the most Brave on this
because the other sort of critiques I've
seen of you know Senator Warren said
that this undermines their their you
know you know image as a tolerant
democracy they're not I mean we just
need to stop having pretend
conversations about Israel it's it's
there are too many people whose lives
have been lost there's too much
repression to keep having a fantasy life
about this place and it's raw and it's
also quite Wrong by the way to the
handful of people left in Israel who are
trying to to fight for some semblance of
open society as well frankly right all
right well we'll talk more about that
with uh Ben Dixon and we should maybe go
over like you know uh
what BDS is I mean yes like you know
from an official standpoint
I I have no doubt there are people who
are associated with BDS who have their
own opinions as to what it is like
people who are associated with the
Democratic party have a different notion
of what it is uh or anything
but it's true but but like you know
there is an official
statement of the organization of BDS and
um
it it it's it's demonized I think by
people who don't know what it is I well
we'll talk more about with Ben Dixon on
this because I I actually think
this is going to be helpful for that
movement uh in many respects
but um
we will like I say we'll talk to Ben
Dixon about that in in a moment
