dave rubin
uh did this interview
it's not on the sheet
what is this gentleman's name that dave
rubin interviewed it's imam
tilwalde i think he is
and he's an uh he's based in australia
and it's where all the best imams go all
the best imam tawi tahiti
imam tahiti now i've
tried to read about this guy because
it's like
he basically tweets out like the most
far-right
ultra-extreme uh
you know anti-muslim anti-immigrant
give me do you have some examples of
things he's tweeted uh yeah give us a
flavor of this imam's
i wish i um this is just uh it's a
picture of tommy robinson
um who is a british uh anti-uh
muslim fascist guy that said if tommy
robinson look like this his right to
free speech will be protected and i'm
just going to put this in front of
michael's camera
[Laughter]
okay it's it's a it's a it's a muslim
man with a beard
it's tommy robinson uh photoshopped to
be wearing muslim garb
that's awesome all right so so basically
like and and
what i'm trying to say here though is as
you can even get by that tweet maybe
we'll have a few others
this is not this isn't like nawaz
uh majid nawaz like
plausible deniability sort of like
pseudo-intellectual
liberalism counter-terrorism talk you
know this isn't just sort of like
the middle brow neocon to neoliberal
with some conspiracies sprinkled in
that you get from majid this is like
the most pure like
even the most self-critical
like maybe in hershey lee might
occasionally say something like this
although she's not as dumb
and she's also like i'm not a muslim
like i'm done with it i hate islam i'm
not into it
there is no person who is going to still
wear
religious garb and be an imam who is
just like yeah
we're just horrible and any
any far right any conspiracy theory any
xenophobia anything
i'm going to endorse on twitter because
ironically or maybe not that ironically
all of these right-wing idiots that
follow me
actually are pure credulist
essentialists who
are not able to discern anything so
let's just get to the clip it's fine we
can deal with it after
oh that clip it's ready let's play that
clip
so of course this guy
zero credibility so where would you go
you go to the zero credibility zone
itself
dave rubin at least because you know in
iraq we had the same situation
how did isis get in isis got into iraq
because certain politicians
played the diversity game you know why
have borders with saudi arabia
why have a wall just let the deserts be
open
and then these cars came in from around
the world then they took over
uh 40 minutes away from baghdad i mean
then politicians went there okay
so and and dave rubin's just like
sitting there just like wow like do you
think when uh back when jesus was around
were
the muslims that he spent time with
nicer wait those working conditions that
you're going to build a wall across the
saudi arabian desert what are those
going to be
yeah there's going to be a lot you guys
have a lot of spring water i bet yeah
you ready got the spring water for the
people
um so i mean i i don't even know i mean
that that's just
so catastrophically doc basically he's
talking about
isis incursions in iraq and i think
2014.
now there was a pretty strong
border between iraq and its neighbors uh
when iraq wasn't
warring with its neighbors under saddam
hussein
and the first sort of foreign invasion
the modern era of iraq that you know i
guess one way of putting it would be
opened up its borders was of course the
u.s uk mass bombardment
and invasion and occupation of that
country i mean that
this is the type of talking point that i
have to i mean i'm trying to get
more ameniable to debating and reasoning
everything out but if you think that
that's a credible statement
you're almost as dumb as dave rubin
uh do we have any more tweets from this
guy
okay so basically i mean this guy
any any cursory and there's all sorts of
questions about his religious
credentials and where he comes from
this is the tommy ross this is the tommy
robinson tweet
uh imam talwaldy if tommy looked like
this his right to free speech would have
been protected
 tommy robinson yeah tommy
robinson
uh any of these other ones
what's the what's the one that says
exposed
uh yeah let's see what they
exposed oh i don't know what this is
um when you call terrorism is
when you call what you call terrorism is
called god's law in saudi arabia and
iran there's always a special budget for
god's law in any
islamic government so islam memes yeah
this is a great this is a great grift
it's a great
business the right does not know how to
beam this is a great business
oh i saw funny um one of those uh
oh not the deal with it but the social
free tommy robinson okay so basically i
mean
you know i i the question for somebody
like this to be honest is gonna be how
far the laundering goes
because dave rubin obvious like he has
no editorial standards
he's not bright he's
totally credulous does sam harris has
sam harris
embraced this guy yet that's the
question like does it move up the food
chain
does this guy have like a bill maher
segment where bill maher was like and
what i don't understand is the muslims
the thing is like that's in some ways
the the
the way to watch dave rubin is like
he swims in the sewage
and then he's sort of like a sewage
scout
for kind of like the soft alt-right or
just even just sort of general
anti-muslim whatever nonsense and
conspiracy theories
i think sam harris might have been tweet
might have tweeted about him but i can't
i'm blocked so i can't really read it
i'll put it in a sound
the tweet that i can read is sam harris
saying this was remarkably honest and
refreshing why aren't most a moms like
this but i'm not 100 people well
sure that's him it's him he's tweeting
there you go so samaras is on the griff
then if that's him sam harris he's not
even in on the griff sam harris is in on
the delusion
that's how you should look at it i mean
this is a guy that you hold up as having
some type of extraordinary intellect
and uh oh my god
that's what he quotes that's what sam
harris thought it was amazing
wow i promise future segments on who
this
imam for peace really is i thought it
was a sasha baron cohen we literally
yeah i thought it was a slash baron
cohen character too maybe he is
maybe it's a long con remarkable honesty
thank you you confirmed all of my
prejudices and complete inability to
read history or policy
thank you why aren't most of moms like
this yeah why don't most of moms hate
their own communities and
advocate for a systemic repression of
them
thank you i feel like it was like
finding like
like you know that would be like it'd be
like the going to the uh
rabbis that go to like the holocaust
denial conference that ahmadinejad did
who are just like like
like they either deny the holocaust or
like it should have happened because
they weren't following jewish law
and then you quote tweet them and you're
like thank you
why can't more rabbis speak like this
the honesty is refreshing
jesus christ and by the way another
button that you have to put on you
i realize now in the youtube world you
need to button things because there's
all these various
versions of literalist idiots out there
none of this implicates you can
criticize islam
you can be an ex-muslim you can object
to religion
you can criticize the policies of saudi
arabia iran whatever
you have to disaggregate that
from being a far right wing xenophobe
who is historically anthropologically
and politically illiterate
that's the point it's not terribly
complicated
i have the most sympathy in this scene
for ex-muslims who grew up in
abusive environments as many people do
in you know in various contexts but
certainly in the context of religious
fundamentalism
but i will say there's a podcast
i believe it's called difficult
conversations is that you know yep
the knight conversation polite excuse me
polite conversations i know
she's in she's anonymous now
her whole career i mean she you know
she's a really good podcast she's got a
good amount of twitter followers check
her out on patreon like children's books
i think right
i think so she my point is teenagers
she's successful
she but she still has to work other jobs
to support herself
and it is very specifically
because she and and there's actually
some areas that i i think
i disagree with her on certain
personalities and certain policies and
so on
although i've always enjoyed the
conversation we had was great i have a
lot of respect for her
the fact that she has not embraced
turned
her critique of a community which is
valid
and her personal trauma which reflects
systemic problems that are real
the fact that she has not turned it into
a bigoted
grift on behalf of the most reactionary
forces in u.s and european society
has held her back
and that tells you everything about
these people
and i would recommend checking out her
pockets yeah yeah the bar is so
low for somebody who's willing to do
that kind of
scabbery look at brendan straca
not to bring him up again well we talk
about that guy way too much
jamie brandon stop saying brendan
dragging my name wait wait wait wait my
bad brondon bronden stroka
brandon stroka
pro striker
do you know what that is man ryan i'm
sure he's watching
does brian does brandon know what
perestroika was
no i don't think so power striker was
a partnership between ronald reagan and
mikhail gorbachev to bring coca-cola to
the soviet union
say it in your next video and that took
down the wall yeah that took down the
wall
yeah it was an apparition to bring
blue jeans to velvet underground and
coca-cola
to the soviet union
