[Music]
you know we're talking about the way
that we
um welcome refugees into this country
we now the number of refugees that we
are now
letting in put aside for a moment
uh what's happening at the border the
the number of refugees from war-torn
countries
is a fraction of what we led in just
three or four years ago
a fifth a sixth maybe a tenth
um i think maybe there's maybe a couple
of thousands
several thousand uh syrian refugees who
will be let in
people's whose homes were destroyed
whose lives were destroyed
cities were destroyed um so when you see
what happens in this clip it's
incredibly disturbing
this is in uh in the uk
these are british kids i guess just
videotaping each other coming off
like it seems to be in a school and
they're on a soccer pitch
and they are um
some british school kids not that young
you know it looks like maybe high school
uh age
and they see a there's a syrian refugee
who must be in their class
it's got a broken arm and they just do
this i mean it's just
it's just a moment of just sort of
stunning cruelty
kids can be super cruel but you know
they're getting this from their parents
and from society at large right
uh and uh we should watch this to be
reminded of just like you know what the
what
what this cruelty is on its most sort of
like basic level
all right jamal leo come here what
[Music]
oh
yeah i mean uh there's a lot of other
kids who come over
uh to this kid's support to a certain
extent but
um can you just imagine like
i mean the best case for this scenario
for this kid
is that he didn't lose uh family members
but but unlikely right and
um i mean it's just it's just
horrible to watch and it just you know
i i the only thing i can tell you is
just like you know the
what we're doing to people at the border
um
in many ways at least metaphorically is
is similar
it's just just a total lack of humanity
um
and god knows what drives it just some
notion of like
this guy's different so he's neces i
mean the kid's obviously not a threat
right it's just whatever problems this
guy has in his head
um
he's gonna take it out by being cruel to
somebody who
filmed the video too it seems like one
of his friends
like the idea if the bullies filmed the
video and thought that that was like a
cool thing to put online that just adds
another
layer of disturbingness to it definitely
wouldn't be the first time they've
oh no they think it's funny they think
it's funny
they think it's really funny very
disturbing
