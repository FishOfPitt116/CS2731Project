how excited are you 1 to 10 about
president de Blasio's campaign okay no
seriously listen we need a mayor who is
going to be on the job 24 hours a day
seven days a week and so I asked the
question has the crisis in affordable
housing been addressed
no has income inequality been addressed
equal pay for equal work
how about cyclists who unfortunately are
dying on our streets as a result of
crashes has that been addressed
environmental issues has that been
addressed so what is the legacy what are
you running on has school segregation
been addressed so all of these issues
and more obviously listen he could run
he's the 23rd candidate I understand
that but the question is why for gang
like what's up so he's a friend
