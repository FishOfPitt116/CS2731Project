so
which one do you want to do this one so
there's an
uprising in hong kong right now there
is a broad set of concerns at stake
and in the politics in hong kong
as far as the sort of capital class goes
there's people on both sides of this
division there's
a very large part of the business sector
there
that has no problem with extremely with
further and further integration with
beijing the story goes back to
at least a modern iteration in 1997 when
britain returned hong kong to china
the agreement was one country two
systems
and that was that hong kong really had
established a level of
of basically liberal protections uh for
its citizens
beijing has never fulfilled that promise
entirely
at all and in the last couple of years
things like this extradition law which
was put on the table
uh which would have allowed citizens of
hong kong to be extradited extradited to
mainland china
have um helped grow a serious protest
movement
as i say i think there's people on the
business side
that are comfortable that are are on
both sides of this conflict
if you have a left perspective and one
of the reasons i get very annoyed with
some of the kind of silly blind china
apologism
is that labor is definitely extremely
concerned about this in a variety of
ways i mean one area is that even just
hong kong because of its relative
openness
is a place where labor unions can base
for monitoring labor
conditions inside china i mean if you're
concerned
about the brutal conditions that apple
as an example uses in china
you're almost certainly getting some of
that information filtered out of people
that are based in hong kong so if you
um are concerned about those issues
those issues
have a serious stake for you with
regards to what's happening in hong kong
and look it's a it's a broad liberal
rights movement and that's a
valid thing frankly um and i think also
there's no doubt that xi xinping who has
consolidated more power for himself than
any chinese premier since mao
and in a context where international
norms are shifting
that china india can just go into
kashmir
make that move the stakes are really
escalating
this video is fascinating
one it should give a lot of people pause
about our critique of the liberation
struggle and the left movements in south
africa i've done a lot of coverage of
south africa
and there's no doubt that there's
internal problems in the anc there's
also no doubt that the economic freedom
fighters
have areas where there should be very
serious critiques
but this woman from south africa
who emigrated to hong kong is a great
example
of the type of class politics that those
that wanted to rebuild south africa into
a proper democracy were up against
yeah this is bigger than her she's a she
represents something that
right and that's why please pray to god
no one finds her name
and bothers her personally or anything
like that this is an avatar for an
attitude it's like
the only reason that this is like you
crystallized in amber sort of like what
the settler project would become
precisely yes from south africa to move
away from this
like south africa has been come on now i
don't want
where am i this is not the hong kong
that i've learned to love like everybody
is so well
like everybody in hong kong is so
lovable and welcoming for all foreigners
and
to experience this it just it hurts me
it really hurts me
how do you feel about the police actions
to the protesters
there's a good and a bad to both
protesters and there's a good and a bad
two police
and i just wish both sides were just
stopped
like i understand what they're fighting
for and i appreciate what everybody's
fighting for
it's easy to see those lovable oriental
she's got enough skin in the game
except for i just want to be in a global
financial hub
with very limited rights and mass
inequality that could be
invaded and formally reoccupied
she understands that michael i get it
people were lovable
the people are loving they were
welcoming humble
inscrutable they had a certain wisdom to
them a certain
we got some more a certain pre-verbal
sense of knowing
all right let's go wish both sides would
just stop
like i understand what they're fighting
for and i appreciate what everybody's
fighting for but this is not what we're
supposed to be like we
supposed to be fighting together not
against each other
this is not the hong kong that i want to
be in really i don't
i would rather go back to south africa
this is what i'm going to be living with
for the next few years
that's unacceptable if they're all
fighting please don't return we
already have enough difficulties can you
maybe look at singapore
this is another area in asia that is
highly repressive
but does not have political instability
yeah you want to keep going can you
maybe go to singapore
could you please consider that if we're
all fighting together
who are we fighting against yeah the
protesters in xi jinping need to
she's fighting on the same side and the
woman who had her eyes shot out by a
bean bag just need to sit down
iron out and say like look this south
african ladies feeling very
uncomfortable yeah
that's a great clue we all need to fight
to make her chill
um go can you look
maybe i have heard that kuala lumpur is
having a boom
please consider there is always dubai
the servants will not even look at you
in the face
[Laughter]
you can buy a passport i assume in your
economic bracket
