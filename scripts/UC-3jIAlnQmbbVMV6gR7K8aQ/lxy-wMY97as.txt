unbelievable influence on the
politicians who are steeped in the
ideology of both parties
and once again i go back to this if i
should run for president

in bed with any special interest
all i'm trying to do is one thing walk
in the shoes
the majority report with sam
cena the destiny of america is always
safer in the hands of the people
than in the conference rooms of any
elites
they are unanimous in their hate for me
and i welcome their hatred we must guard
against
the acquisition of unwarranted influence
whether sought or unsought by the
military
industrial complex the majority report
with sam cedar ever get the feeling
you've been cheated

annual majority report dinner but by the
time we have to take sam by the arms and
squirt him out of the restaurant or
usually pro
post picture after the second bottle of
red wine yes
does anybody want my red wine
and then and we're all like yeah i mean
if you're if you're if you're buying
sure and then brendan's like no um i am

yeah sam was sam really let me have it
there was like a new england etiquette
fight going on between
like bizarre nonsense between brendan
and sam last night
sam apparently doesn't eat fresh water
fish fresh water fish
no brackish i'll eat i'll eat brackish
is fine
becky she's okay oysters you never know
where they came from you just suck them
right out what freshwater fish
freshwater fish is the lavender of the
sea
oh my god um
alexandria ocasio-cortez was snubbed
by nancy pelosi who had some very just
boring dull comments about the green new
deal today which is you know or
yesterday
everybody supports it but nobody knows
what it is well we're going to explain
precisely not only what it is but the
contours around it
with kane aronoff who's one of the
probably i would say the leading
journalist of this in the game in a few
minutes
and the leading politician of the green
new deal is of course alexandria
ocasio-cortez
she was on uh did an extended interview
with npr and steve
inskeep that came out uh just i believe
either
yesterday during all things considered
or today from morning edition
i'm not sure maybe i should look at my
sound sheet
morning edition so it came out uh today
here she is um she gets the you know you
expect to get the
the you know how you're going to pay for
a question yadda yadda
but this is really uh important actually
because not only does she parlay this
question but this is actually a broader
argument she gets into here which i know
that
you know this is where the mmt stuff is
really important
uh for how we discuss policy making this
is
aoc talking about how to pay for a green
new deal
you're talking about things that
obviously would cost a lot of money i
know you'd rather think of it as an
investment rather than a cost but it is
just certainly a lot of money you don't
specify where it's going to come from
other than saying it will all pay for
itself yeah i think the first thing that
we need to do
is is kind of break the mistaken idea
that taxes pay for 100 of government
expenditure
it's just not how government expenditure
works we can recoup costs
but oftentimes you look at for example
the gop tax cut which
i think was an irresponsible use of
government expenditure but government
projects are often financed by a
combination
of taxes uh deficit spending
and other kinds of of investments you
know bonds and so i get that but deficit
spending is borrowing money that has to
be paid back eventually through taxes
yeah and i think well i think that is
always the crux of it so when we decide
to to go into the realm of deficit
spending we have to do so responsibly
we ask is this an investment or is this
actually going to pay for itself so
you're saying borrow the money
make the investment the economy will
grow it'll pay off the debt
absolutely because we're creating jobs
although i do have to say you you
mentioned the republican tax cut
they said the same thing about the tax
cut let's do this tax cut the economy
will grow it's going to be great it's
going to pay for itself
uh hasn't turned out to be true at all
absolutely and i i think that
that that is an important distinction to
make because when they were advancing
that cause
they had no evidence to say that these
things were going to happen
but we actually do have the evidence for
every one dollar invested in
infrastructure we get six dollars back
okay so look she's absolutely right on
the merits
uh there's no doubt that particularly if
you have control over your own currency
and spending
you can do these types of moves and
this is actually as zach carter points
out this is one of the things that sort
of
broke the brains of the 90s consensus
because through
several cycles now there's been this
oh my god the deficit's going to come
and we're going to pay the price
there was a whole scam that threw off
the economic recovery after wall street
melted the economy in 2008 of people all
of a sudden saying
we needed to go into austerity in fact
the united states
had a bit of a better recovery cert in
fact a much better recovery than the
european union
because of even just an incredibly
modest stimulus package that the obama
administration
pushed through before unfortunately
acquiescing to austerity themselves the
eurozone
sunk their whole economy through
austerity
and of course seriously practiced
you know just vicious cruelty on greece
so
she's absolutely right on the merits and
also in terms of the more narrow
question
yes how many more jets can
oligarchs buy that has diminishing
returns if you put money into
normal people's pockets and create jobs
it has
um you know it has a stimulative effect
that's the stat on put in one get
six out now it's a and it's frankly a
boring annoying question that we already
sort of know the answer to but frank but
look
whatever npr is going to ask that
question they're going to ask how you
pay for it
what is actually pretty unacceptable
journalistic malpractice
is to draw the equivalency between
republicans talking about their top end
tax redistribution
and us and investing in energy
infrastructure and generating a new
economy we
know empirically those two things are
not
comparable you could even on far ends of
comparison here you could even just look
at the results of the
obama 2009 stimulus as well as the
trump tax giveaway or the bush tax
giveaway and you could see
these things had very different effects
in terms of
bang for your buck so the fact that
that is still a talking point i don't
think you'll ever get to a point and
frankly i don't know that you should as
much as i might roll my eyes at the
question i think
how are you going to pay for it okay
that question will continue
the equivalency between investing in
transforming our energy infrastructure
and the massive
social economic uh
and ecological benefits of that
versus yet another tax giveaway
when even bill clinton was sort of
explaining that trickle down didn't work
in the 90s
uh relative to reagan and bush tax cuts
that's
ridiculous like npr just needs to update
their style guide on that
also you don't we don't ever we're never
going to just pay the debt
never like no nor should we that would
be
it's really bad yeah but it's it's
somehow in
implicit in a lot of these questions
like well someday we're gonna need to
you know bounce the books on this as
well not maybe not there's not gonna be
a day
where the present united states and the
premier of china sit down
and the president writes a check for
three trillion dollars from the treasury
and they both are just like all right it
was nice doing business with you
go back to our respective spheres of
influence that's not how it works that's
not how the economy or international
relations works
and also if you want to talk about
coming to a head with debt
i'm far less concerned about government
debt but you do need to
for countries that have been
systemically exploited in the global
system
through histories of colonialism
imperialism or through austerity and
abuse today so this could be anywhere
from
haiti to ukraine you need to have
massive debt relief
you need to have a jubilee for the
entire african continent you need to
have a jubilee for great parts of latin
america
asia eastern europe and there also needs
to be
mass public debt forgiveness as an
example in the form of student loans the
united states everybody's student loans
the united states should be
erased would have huge economic benefit
and of course be the right thing to do
so if you want to have like a come to a
head conversation about debt
i'm all for it let's talk about all the
debts we need to erase and forgive
so we don't have a loan shark economy
anymore

a brief break and we'll be right back
with kate aronoff
welcome back michael brooks here on the
majority report joining us now is kane
aronoff
she is a fellow at the type media center
and a contributing writer at the
intercept she's also just
uh written and co-edited this series for
the jacobin magazine
on the foundations of a green
new deal kate thanks for being here how
you doing
i'm doing great thanks for having me
thanks for doing this so
let's start with the green new deals
five
freedoms uh this is one of several
pieces that you and your co-authors
put out in the jackman magazine what are
the five
freedoms of the green new deal
so uh sort of following in the mold
of fdr's four freedoms um we laid out
five
that are really sort of set for the 21st
century
uh and the various crises that we face
and so
those are freedom of fear freedom from
toil freedom to move
freedom from domination and the freedom
to live
so this sort of cracks tying all those
things together
is that you know the climate crisis has
often talked about this thing that we
can only sort of defeat if we
sacrifice so many things if we you know
give up hamburgers and vacations and
um the sort of things that make our
lives so wasteful and carbon intensive
but what we think is that that actually
really breaks down a lot of the
power relationships that are embedded in
how this crisis has come to be
and so that plays out on the
international level
so united states and what are known as
historical emitters are the most
responsible for this crisis
um but maybe even more so than that
fossil fuel companies
are uh are extremely responsible for
this about
100 companies 100 companies exactly
have been responsible for 71
global emissions since 1988 and so
those fossil fuel executives right will
have to
give up some things uh very very
wealthy individuals who take uh
frequent plane trips between london and
new york for instance as many bankers do
who live hugely carbon intensive
lifestyles they'll have to sacrifice
some things right but for the rest of us
life can actually get
um much better and so what we lay out
in sort of you know supporting sort of
vision for a great new deal
are these freedoms and the kind of way
that are that most people's lives can
really improve
as we transition to a low carbon economy
so
um take something like freedom from fear
so um you know
we're already locked in for a certain
amount of warming we're probably on our
way to about 1.3 degrees
no matter what we do and that means more
more extreme temperatures that means
stronger storms that means some level of
sea level rise
and sort of what we put put out is that
nobody should
um have to fear that they won't you know
have a roof over they have when that
happened that it won't be
um but they won't be protected from
those from those things and moreover
that
um people should never live in fear of
things like
food scarcity or water shortages um or
moreover from the kinds of
racist colonial and sexual violence that
sort of define and make so many people's
lives so difficult
um people shouldn't you know fear that
if they
have to leave their country they'll face
a militarized border and uh
be interned in inhumane facilities as
they were seeing along our southern
border
i can go into each of them but um yes
can i just
yeah i would that's great and maybe
actually i would love another couple of
examples because i
i love how it follows and expands on fdr
i think that's a
really really effective model for
communicating this
but i think it's really important to
really underline
this kind of like critique of lifestyle
politics
that i feel like you're doing um and
because
for a couple of reasons in my mind at
least
one uh obviously
there's going to be changes i think you
know particularly hopefully in how we
get around
and move right like a lot more public
transportation a lot less cars a lot
more
uh density and a lot more um
you know tighter communities and more
efficiency and so on
um but the frame that
you know we have this like cataclysmic
global crisis and the answer is that
you individual consumers should
buy more recycled goods eat less meat
and i and as always i always have to
stipulate
i'm not critiquing these things i i buy
recycled goods
i i'm not a vegetarian but i you know i
certainly don't eat that much meat and
the ones i do
is you know organic and so on and i
understand people have a million
responses to those things but my point
being is
i'm not leveling a critique in anybody's
personal choices i think that's great
but i do think that the frame that any
of your personal choices
are going to in any way really
fundamentally deal with this crisis
is just absurd on its face
connected to which the rhetoric
of lifestyleism actually does correlate
with evading
the fundamental questions that we have
to ask about inequality and capital
uh that contribute to this crisis and
and then i just want to put on the table
too it also does start to kind of
manifest in sick ways like
if it's all just about your kind of
individual output
well an oligarch i you know i think this
is basically a scam but you know sure i
took a private jet but i bought carbon
offsets to plant trees
in swaziland so i'm fine now you on the
other hand
you know poor person in the bronx or
mumbai
you should use less air conditioning
during the heat wave because we have a
climate crisis
and that actual synthesis of the
covering
up of the inequality and capital
dynamics behind the climate crisis
with an emphasis on lifestyleism starts
to get really clear i think in those
contrasting examples of
of the kind of social and economic
pathologies that they put forward
yeah i i think i mean i think you you
said it exactly right and
i i don't think we couldn't understand
how
this rhetoric plays out in the climate
world without sort of understanding
um the last 30 to 40 years of history in
which neoliberalism has
really done a good job at convincing
people that
you know as margaret thatcher's head
there's no such thing as society and so
you know in this focus on individual
responsibility for everything you know
we hear similar rhetoric um
around poverty it's like if you are in
poverty it's because you didn't work
hard enough right and it's
that kind of logic extended and you know
maybe more subtle ways
um to the climate and it's just as
absurd right
just like you know people often can't
get a job because the economy doesn't
want to give them a job
um often people consume
because the economy structures the way
that they consume right and so
i i don't think it's really useful
to shame people for eating meat
uh or for um you know even
going on vacation or something and and
taking uh taking a plane
um that they that they uh find a ticket
board that's really cheap when they've
never
you know traveled out of the country or
something like i don't think it's really
useful to
um to shame people for that especially
you know when we haven't created
really robust alternatives um and again
i think the key point
as you said and i said earlier is that
this really just covers up so many power
relationships and
the really sort of absurd way in which
responsibility for this crisis
is concentrated in such a small number
of very very wealthy people in
industries
yeah and i would just also i think i
would add we'll get back to
maybe a couple of other examples for of
these freedoms which you outlined so
well but i would also add you know
having children to that list
right um because you look at the history
both i mean going back particularly to
like
the 70s and how ideas from like the
population bomb and stuff were
applied to trying to shrink population
growth in africa and asia and he's just
like
i mean the rhetoric was horrifying uh
and the context
enormously disturbing on these highly
exploited continents to say well yeah
but the real answer is you should have
less kids
but even down to today that every kind
of
you know lifestyle politics article
about like well i'm lessening my carbon
footprint by not having a kid
is actually just sweeping under the rug
and i know you know there's been pieces
published by
about this in the jackman recently just
like actually the fact that
there's a horrific hole in the safety
net for young families
for regardless of whatever reasons
people are having kids and it's another
it's a way in which this stuff is
actually getting marshaled to
justify a bad punitive policies
in general and actually undermine
the basic decency and well-being that
everybody should have
yeah i mean i don't think i can say it
any better than that but
i would just add that uh you know this
is a really sort of convenient line for
fossil fuel companies it's a really
convenient line for the people who
actually hold responsibility for this
crisis
um to sort of cast that off and talk
about these sort of
you know sustainability measures or
whatever you know whether that be
banning plastic straws or or you know up
until
having kids and then talking about
population and stuff
and i think you know that just really
sort of whether
it's fossil fuel executives who are
saying it or not really just does play
into
um covering up their role in in
um having known about this crisis for
decades now
and not just sort of um
gone in the other direction and
continued to do something they knew
they know is so bad for the planet and
for the people on it
but actively funding disinformation
campaigns
to you know obscure the reality of that
of that crisis and the findings of their
own scientists what about freedom from
toil
yeah so i this is one of my favorite
ones
that we included um i think something
that doesn't get
talked about enough when we talk about
the green new deal
is that people could probably work less
and so we have this idea
right when we talk about green job the
people um putting up
uh wind turbines putting up
solar panels on homes you know that's
certainly all part of it
um but i i don't want to
focus overly on how much there is a lot
of work to do
obviously to create this transition um
but
if we set it up right people can also
work much shorter
um work weeks and so you know why is
that
um if you think about a lot of the work
that people do
in the country it's not um a it's not
necessarily
productive in any sort of like
societally
meaningful way it's productive for
corporate profits
um but you know there's no reason why
if you are taking a job
with uh under a federal job guarantee
for instance
um and you're doing something like
remediating wetlands for instance or
you're
hanging out with old folks which is
another thing that that a federal job
guarantee could do
um or writing plays you know um
that's uh both you know hopefully labor
that's less
alienated so it's things that are you
know improving your community that you
can find value in
um that's not just sort of producing
widgets for um
so that a few corporate executives can
profit um
so i think that you know is what is one
way in which uh
solving the climate crisis or or
mitigating the climate crisis um
helps to take away toil but it's also
that you know people can like
have vacations and things like if you're
working 20 hours a week
because we've decided as a society that
we don't need to produce
mountains of cheap junk and sell that
cheap enough to people
um then there's more time to you know go
to the beach to take
a high-speed rail which we will
hopefully build as part of the green new
deal
to go hang out with your friends in
other cities there's all this sort of
like realm of of life that
i think gets so sort of tragically lost
under capitalism because
um people you know are working too many
jobs the unemployment rate
um is low in the united states um
but how much of that is people working
uh you know
awful jobs two or three jobs at a time
um and so i think this is you know a
real sort of quality of life question
and that we
people can have a better quality of life
and there's no reason why
um in the united states where we work so
much more
in so many other parts of the world uh
people can't
can't sort of you know have their uh
eight hours for what they will um the
old neighbor saying goes or
hopefully much more definitely it
reminds me of a
book uh wasted lives by ziggman bauman
where he drew the connection between
it's obviously you're in a more
privileged position mostly
just as a kind of generic statement if
you have a job than if you don't
obviously there's different types of
exceptions right if you're
sitting on a bunch of income and not
working but overall
if you have a job but he did draw this
correlation just of the theme of
wasted life so whether you're totally
grinded out um and just
you know literally physically or
emotionally destroyed
by work um
that's a way of sort of being grinded
and wasted and discarded and then
there's also the overt
waste and discard of you know you are
structurally useless in this system
which is the sort of like structurally
unemployed right and then also
implicitly saying right because there's
plenty of people who
are you know quote unquote unemployable
but they might actually have
a lot of the assets uh and traits that
you outlined in terms of like
being great mentors or good people to
hang out in different community contexts
or contribute
art or contribute you know all sorts of
other forms of labor so it also like
i love it because it's like you both
decrease all of the trash work that we
use to just create
surplus for companies but we also sort
of open up a much bigger set of human
capacities that we can harness
yeah yeah exactly and it's such a sort
of narrow realm of what we consider to
be productive
right right in capitalism and i think um
you know
as happened during the original new deal
you know you can pay people to like put
on
a great place for instance and
you know go around the country writing
travel guides for different states like
that was a
works progress administration program
and it's awesome like those travel
guides still exist and they're really
fun to read
um you know i think that's totally
within the within the realm of the
murals i mean sometimes you will just
randomly see
some like great building in upstate new
york like what when did that happen
it's like oh right that was a new deal
thing they paid people to do
you know just to create something that
looked great and usually could serve
some really excellent
community purpose um the
nancy pelosi said i think yesterday like
oh everybody likes the new deal
green new deal but nobody knows what it
is and
right so okay i think we kind of do but
that being said i mean
you point out that uh the green new deal
rhetoric has been around for a long time
and maybe there's a socialist version of
it
maybe there's a kind of progressivey
version of it
maybe there's a straight up bloombergian
third way version of it
aoc's unveiled her version today but
just broadly so this this term doesn't
get
lost um what are we looking for in terms
of the details
uh for a plan that really does carry out
those five freedoms
yeah so this five-page resolution that
um representative ocasio-cortez
introduced along with senator
markey um there's a lot in it i'll
go through the the sort of policy
highlights and then get into the
politics of it so
the main goal is to get to a hundred
percent
meet 100 of the demand for power in the
united states with clean renewable and
zero
emission energy sources um which is
a goal that's in line with the
scientific consensus on climate change
unlike a lot of other climate policy
um this would provide all people in the
united states with clean air and water
with healthy and affordable food high
quality health care
affordable safe and adequate housing and
economic security
it would do things like create a federal
job guarantee as we were just talking
about
massive infrastructure build out
building efficiency upgrades
robust investment in public transit
it would uh ensure that in you know
building up low carbon infrastructure
um we're not infringing on indigenous
people's land rights or
abusing the power of eminent domain uh
it will
provide a just transition and ensure a
dignified quality of life for
workers and communities that have
historically relied on coal
oil and natural gas jobs i
you know could go on as a five-page
resolution so i won't list out
no style everything but really sort of
what this what this does
is to set a standard for a green new
deal and say look this isn't just a
talking point we're talking about very
concrete things that we'd like to do
this isn't you know
the sort of most uh this isn't the
legislation that will be passed
uh that implements the green new deal
right they
uh ocasio-cortez had asked for a select
committee
on a green new deal which which nancy
pelosi decided not to create
um which would have spent a year uh
looking at
at these sorts of proposals and coming
up with that sort of detail plan and so
that's something that
um folks are very interested in doing uh
out you know
outside of congress and hopefully as
much as possible sort of uh
within within washington um but
you know this sort of says to um
especially you know potential 2020
contenders
uh who have said they all support a
green new deal this is what you're
talking about you know you can't just
talk about
um a couple of renewable energy tax
credits for
a select group of entrepreneurs as a
green new deal you know you really have
to be
committed to this this really wildly
ambitious goal
of getting to 100 percent uh renewable
clean and zero emission uh power by
2030.
um and it's about the public sector and
it's about
democracy it's not about like offloading
it
in these sort of like public-private
partnerships to incentivize this or that
it's mobilizing our resources
as a collective to achieve massive goals
yeah yeah exactly and it's not um it's
not opposed
per se to private investment it's not
saying there can't be
a private capital is part of it but um
what it what it does affer
even sort of in the in the preamble uh
is say that you know the united states
has done uh
big things before as they as they say
the federal government led mobilizations
during world war ii in the new deal
that created the greatest middle class
the united states has ever seen
uh and you know we've done this before
like we can do this and this is kind of
what we
what we want to be the principles
carrying that out talk
and we have a couple minutes left left
and i think you know
the corollary of this is another piece
in jacobin that you published it's time
to try fossil fuel executives for crimes
against humanity
make the case
so i i mentioned a bit of this earlier
but um
but fossil fuel companies have known for
a very very long time since as early as
the late 50s
they have been doing research into the
existence of climate change
and what they found not too long after
they started doing that research was
not only is this a massive problem uh
but
uh a massive problem that will you know
create
untold suffering for so many people um
that our
product is causing it our product has a
has a massive role to play in this
um shell in the 80s uh
found that they were responsible for
four percent of greenhouse gas emissions
that's a figure that they
um that they identified and so even with
this knowledge
um they were very very active in
imploring uh pouring so much money
into disinformation campaigns um that we
all know so well that you know
um allow uh allow for
think tanks to uh send out sort of
climate denying fact sheets to
freshmen everyone from sort of freshman
state senators
to senators in the congress
and just blankly deny the existence of
climate change and so um
all the while they were doing that they
were continuing to dig up more fossil
fuels to explore
um explore for new reserves and to lobby
congress
um to against passing any sort of even
common sense regulations on them to tear
up regulations where they did exist
and basically to give them a free rein
and to give them
you know the 20 billion dollars a year
they collect annually
in subsidies um in various forms
and so the industry has a clear
knowledge uh that they that they've been
causing this problem
they know uh you know even beyond exxon
and shell
who we have no documentation proving
that they knew this for a while
um no one can deny the
mass suffering that climate change will
cause no one can deny that the fossil
fuel industry is causing it and yet
they continue to do that and so under
the rome statue
which sort of lays out what constitutes
crime against humanity
um my case is what that qualifies
i agree with your case
well thank you how are you going to pay
for it kate no i'm just kidding
that's the real question is is how are
you going to pay for it a lot of people
are talking about the rome statute but
that requires additional court space at
the hague so
i'm steve inskeep how do you pay for
that um

and sorry
i didn't i got only two
hold on just before we get to that um
nancy pelosi in this uh this is the
actual quote about the
green new deal she said uh it will be
one of several or maybe many suggestions
that we receive
uh the green dream or whatever they call
it
nobody knows what it is but they're for
it right the green dream
and uh natalie shore uh
aspect of this is her intentional
botching of the name
right she uh this is natalie speaking so
i'm not gonna censor her she
knows
what it's called and is being willfully
disparaging green new deal
explicitly evokes one of the most
popular moments in presidential history
right green dream evokes childish
nonsense that's precisely it like as a
marco rubio once said she knows exactly
what she's doing she knows exactly what
she's doing and it's really
no and it is it's absolutely shameful um
and you know i think i think especially
us
like we've played
and we'll continue to play it very fair
with nancy pelosi
you know she's dominated
trump very well a lot of the ire at the
democratic leadership
uh in a narrow sense should be much more
focused at schumer than pelosi
but the bottom line is
and this is really where it just comes
down to like the stuff you got to be
that should be just talked about a lot
more
it's just politics and her politics are
different radically than our politics
and
part of that is because of the money and
the contributions that she uh
gets that is you know i think actually
some of the ways people talk about money
in politics gets very simplistic there's
much bigger questions of really just
existing in a marketplace some of it's
maybe
generational some of it's maybe
temperamental i don't know i don't care
um but there's been the substantive
snubs like not doing the subcommittee
and then there's the childish
undermining of it
uh which you saw there and you know
this is still in the context of people
actually whispering
that the most
you know any any adjective you could
throw successful dynamic
interesting high profile
important influential young politician
in the country
should be primaried i mean
of course it's not a direct comparison
because
president obama was a centrist but just
on a pure media level could you imagine
if barack obama got into the senate in
2004
and just and and you know he was it was
a very different thing he was again he
was in the center of the party
and he was de-emphasizing his media
profile
but just how demented just could you
imagine just like
we should primary that guy totally yeah
he's
he's the most talented politician in the
country we should we should primary him
uh of course it's different with
ocasio-cortez because of
ideology and because she represents a
different politics in the democratic
leadership
some of it's also petty as jealousy
and you know the idea that people
are looking and it would have to be
even if they got some decent local
politician
although you really couldn't be decent
you'd have to be an absolute idiot to
challenge her
you would have to front load that
campaign with real estate and wall
street money
and just run on smears and the fact that
that's actually like
a conversation in dc i don't want to
exaggerate it but you've heard enough of
these ripples
to know that it is actually a thing not
just something that
one random idiot said and all the other
sane people dismissed
shows how deep and insane the problem is
as does
pelosi just loathe some comments about
the green new deal

what what what what what what what what
what what what
what what almost says
hello
[Music]
have you tried doing an impression on a
college campus
i i think that there's no reason why
reasonable people across the divide
can't all
see donald trump out there doesn't a
little part of you think that america
deserves to be taken over by jihadists
keeping it 100
the
someone needs to pay the price for
blasphemy around here
i am a total
[Music]
i always i wanted uh trump to come out
to the state of the union to danarky's
track
and then just have that play out the
alpha males are back yeah
they have isn't that right mike alpha
males
and they sure are back there's some
weird account on twitter i don't know
what the story is behind it but they
apparently don't like bernie sanders but
they've been doing incredible work for
bernie sanders
this is a clip from 1988
89 18 looks like february 3rd 89th oh
excuse me okay but they're talking about
the 88 race right february 3rd 1989.
so this is a on c-span bernie sanders i
believe
if this is 89 i think he was probably in
between being mayor of burlington and
getting elected to the house he was
elected to the house
i think in either 92 or 90.
so this question is about the jesse
jackson 1988
campaign it's no secret and again a kind
of funny irony
of this attempt to uh
you know of a lot of the kind of smears
and disingenuous narratives about bernie
sanders he did in fact
uh strongly support jesse jackson's
presidential run in the late
80s now
i don't think he frankly should get
extra credit for it either it's just
frankly that he was a progressive leader
and jesse jackson ran
the most progressive campaign um and uh
in fact if you listen to some of the
conversations i've done with bill
fletcher jr who's just
indispensable and please everybody find
bill fletcher jr he's
just the brilliant i mean really one of
the most important people you could be
reading and listening to today
both on this program and then much more
specifically in an illicit history for
tnbs of the jesse jackson campaign which
he worked on
we have actually outlined some of the
ways in which the specific concepts of
the rainbow coalition
and ideas of that campaign including
though also frankly just some specific
talents that jesse jackson has as a
campaigner
bernie didn't replicate as effectively
as he could have done 2016 and should in
2020 if he runs again
uh but that being said of course he
supported jesse jackson and he'll
explain why
and it appears to be that this is that
really the account
yeah uh never never underscore bernie uh
not affiliated with any presidential
candidate it has 102 tweets 27
uh it's following 27 people and has 45
followers but this tweet
has been viewed 124 thousand times all
right well thank you
whatever the idiot behind this account
is um
i guess the angle they're going for here
is bernie's
concern about the democratic party uh
but it's just a good
time to remind everybody that bernie
sanders was a strong supporter of jesse
jackson
hard to find one anymore and i want to
know what you thought of
reverend jesse jackson's campaign
whether you agreed with most of those
points that he was making and i want to
give you one little footnote that's of
some interest i think
my nieces had uncles on both sides
of their families their mothers and
their fathers named eugene
v as in victor right
in burlington we had a real debate about
our attitude toward
jesse jackson's campaign i think many of
us were impressed
by the positions that jackson was
bringing forth
we were deeply impressed by the concept
of the rainbow coalition which i believe
is exactly what has to be done in this
country
and we were impressed by jackson's
charisma
and is going into the ghettos and into
the poor areas and speaking for the
family farmers who are being thrown off
of their land and that moved us very
much the problem that we had
is that of course jackson was
functioning within the democratic party
and we are not democrats so we had a
discussion
within our own organization and we ended
up saying yeah we're not democrats but
we think what jackson
was doing was so important that we are
going to support him and for one night
in vermont we did go into the democratic
party and in fact
jackson ended up uh winning the
democratic caucuses
uh so i was sympathetic to jackson i
agree with
the concept of the rainbow coalition i
do disagree with jesse
in terms of whether the democratic party
can be the real vehicle for social
change i believe
it should be a third party well of
course bernie has sort of revised
himself and actually ended up following
jesse jackson's direction on that
practically even though he still is an
independent um
and they actually maintained a decent
relationship i don't recall whether
jesse jackson stayed neutral in 2016
although i think he might have actually
endorsed bernie um although he also has
a close relationship with the clintons
in spite of
some enormously disrespectful treatment
that bill clinton delivered jesse
jackson in the 90s and
jesse jackson certainly has his own
highly complicated and
problematic probably more populist than
left politics if you listen to
you know some of bill fletcher's
analysis and bill fletcher's also
worked on that campaign as i keep saying
one of the most astute
people in american politics by far bill
fletcher jr but uh
yeah what a monster there's uh there's
you know bernie again
beating the drum for white nationalism i
mean i you know
i you know again it's just gotten so
demented especially as somebody and i
will always say this
uh who was a strong bernie supporter as
soon as he announced
i knew of course i would support him
because i'm progressive
uh but you know i i thought the first
several protests he faced first couple
protests black lives matter were
excellent
they were correct to protest him and
other candidates in and of itself
period and in fact in his case they made
him a much better candidate
um but you know now we're
i mean some of the stuff i just see
about him is just i mean
it's just so cynical and breathtakingly
disingenuous
and absurd and the kind of
vendetta against him um look
it will never stop being just utterly
bizarre and again i'll throw one more in
the mix i say this as somebody who
you know i told people
and we reflected i believe 89
91 of bernie primary voters because only
90 didn't vote for hillary clinton in
the general election
who said of course if you're in a swing
state vote for hillary clinton and in
fact i ended up voting for hillary
clinton in new york
because i was so you know just
you know the whole jill stein thing is
another thing but the the whole the
green party's argument about change was
so moralistic and non-strategic
that it wasn't even a satisfying protest
vote so i thought to myself you know
what
i'm going to vote for the first woman
president that's something cool in and
of itself
but i'm sitting here and i'm tabling
support for the coup in honduras
support for the bankruptcy bill support
for crime legislation
support i mean you can just go on and
on and on and on all on a policy level
haiti uh and yet you know
some people on the other side of that
equation maintain
a just bizarre cultish fanatical hatred
of the guy
which is just breathtaking and again i
say this to somebody who's like
i'll disagree with you if you don't
support him in 2020 i'll strongly
disagree but like
cool whatever you know vote for who you
need to vote for you have a criticism
that's legitimate
like a bill fletcher juniors excellent i
want to hear it but
so much of what's marshaled against him
is just
a response to a fiction that people have
created in their heads about him or
maybe bad response to
people that support him on on social
media but not him
and you know i think clips like that are
a good reminder
so thank you uh weird never brody
twitter account i personally have a long
history of getting upset
uh at politicians not observing a long
enough lag time between speeches before
they give their own speeches
so it wasn't the first time for me
getting upset about that specific thing
oh my god
also just man twitter is terrible um
actually let's do we have this one i
want to get i want to do
no miki real quick um there was
a debate last night in new york city
uh this public advocate race is first
and foremost important for new york city
obviously
but this is uh new york city
legitimately has national in fact global
implications
no mickey const we know her she's a
great candidate she's a
real progressive she's got some
incredibly creative ideas
about how to use this really unique
office as sort of
um uh public accountability but
also almost like a sort of massive
investigative journalism fund
um and she's talking really smart really
shrewd democratic socialist ideas and
refusing
money from the real estate industry
which is of course
enormously dangerous and harmful in new
york as it is everywhere else
and here she is talking about what's
happening with the mta
blame privatization blame or blame
austerity blame uh lack of investment
blame lack of redistribution uh and
thank
the workers and labor unions who are
still keeping the thing running
while andrew cuomo and others have
undermined it
here she is talking about what should be
done for the mta
i believe in the municipalization of the
mta i
i do think that uh the city should have
more control but it shouldn't all land
in the mayor's hands
that's the problem with this city when
you look at the mta board
they're all political appointees you
have a real estate developer
on the board of the mta who is best
friends with the governor
someone who doesn't live in the city who
admitted to not taking buses
ever that's the person who's deciding
our livelihood
the lifeblood of this city is being
starved
let me say that again the mta is being
starved
of resources they are intentionally not
putting money into the mta
what i believe is for the reason of
privatizing it
it's an old scheme starve the city of
its infrastructure
don't tax the wealthy to fund that
infrastructure and then put the cost on
working people
who are not only being driven out of
their homes because they're being
rezoned by these developers
but now it's harder for them to commute
to work which could cost them pay
or worse their jobs so we need to audit
the mta and we need to municipalize it
so the whole city has power over its
lifeblood
wisconsin for right now though given the
governance structure should the city be
giving more money to the church yes but
i think that they should be taxing
these developers amazon and and the
oligarchs who are
who are buying up real estate left and
right and using our buildings as the
cayman islands for their bank accounts
boom contribute to and vote for nomikee
const can we get do you mind looking up
that's a couple of weeks voting day
um that's a big race uh and i want no
miki out there
front and center talking about the
oligarchs using new york city real
estate like the cayman islands and yes
there's not a single problem that can't
be solved by
taking back money from amazon and other
oligarchs
the mta is just one of many tuesday
february 26th
get out there let's make it happen no
mickey const new york city public
advocate all right
uh billy or excuse me be silly
npr's insightful question aoc the
republicans said they were implementing
a policy that was beneficial to the
country it wasn't and now you're saying
exactly the same thing
yes i mean that was again i'll give you
the
you know i'll give you the uh
how are you gonna pay for a question
fine whatever
it's boring it's kind of hacky but
sure but the
republicans who just lie as a matter of
essentially i mean maybe not in the npr
world but i mean a
pretty broad public record that we have
endless
i mean we've already seen them lie about
various wealth
redistribution to the rich tax packages
and how they've worked out
um the i mean the closest analog we have
to what she's talking about in a in a
microscopic form would be the 2009
stimulus
and then of course historically the new
deal
which still today takes people out of
poverty so i mean
just the idea that you're drawing that
analogy is just beyond ludicrous tax
cuts to
versus infrastructure spending i mean
it's just
yeah it's embarrassing it's i mean
these major media companies are
pathological with this stuff
like they can't these people cannot
learn
the lessons that they need to which is
why i mean historically speaking
we've probably talked about this before
but 19th century it was all
partisan and you know ideological news
basically and i think there
we need more of that because of how uh
how much these sort of mid-century news
companies
like the mass culture like the major
networks and those things
they were for a different time and they
the harmful effects i mean
this is what chomsky made his bones on
but like like
i good riddance to him i guess is what
no i i agree
i mean not and and the function of
aggressive objective reporting which is
already which is also by the way
profoundly underfunded by these same
incumbent corporations
is a separate function but yeah
the whole editorial line and bloat
get rid of it support people like us
honestly
it's better period um
habermas malo
michael i'm curious what you think of
lee phillips book austerity ecology now
he says that greenpeace is just as
guilty of crimes against humanity as
fossil fuel companies
i work in wpa building and every school
i
went to was built during the wpa
i'm not a pig farm in the ozarks because
of massive military spending during the
new deal era my grandfather got free
housing education and job
um but listen ocasio understands we have
individual
agency mlk was talking about the trans
valuation of values during great society
in kensington era because he understood
that the quote unquote public sector was
not necessarily democratic
we need to stop depending on the
capitalists and their states and courts
to save us all right i
don't exactly understand the last thread
there and again i
my critique of lifestyle neoliberal
lifestyle politics is
not a suggestion that one shouldn't you
know take individual actions but
again across the board
including on conversations that occur in
other arenas the emphasis
on personal uh you know
the conversation on personal behavior is
way
way over focused on and actually the
extent that it should be
talked about it should be much more in
realms of
psychology and community building and
which are
all apart and interact with politics but
if you really want to get to the like
these macro questions you got to be in
politics and economics and for the
purposes of a left-wing podcast it's
what we choose to spend our time on is
not that stuff it'd be
literally a waste of time you can get
that elsewhere yeah precisely um
uh okay the second point yes the wpa was
really a big deal i haven't read lee
phillips books i've read
excerpts of it and i like a lot of it my
my concern be as you present that
that's a you know that sounds very
hyperbolic to me
right so i don't um i
i i want to but i want to read it before
i comment on it uh
fairness fairy ugh all right i'm going
to read this
and then if there's an i am that
responds to it i'll read that but i'm
not going to take calls on this i'll
just say up front
i hopefully there'll be an i am that
responds to this and then that's it
the idea that veganism is necessary to
address climate change is overly
simplistic many vegan substitutes or
butter for instance are tropical oils
like palm or coconut
while there may or may not be produced
sustainably they also may not
deforestation fuel for transportation
can all contribute to climate change as
well we should all eat less meat and
dairy and work to
reduce industrial farming many people
also cannot tolerate a 100 vegan diet
i have to be honest and i really want to
get into this debate but i
i tell me they'll tell me the lie in
that take
that that take is all objectively true
um and i'm not opposed you know if you
want to go for veganism that's great
but that's a very smart very sensible
take and if there's another take
i'll read it but no calls all right
first call of the day you're calling
from a 210 area code who are you where
you calling from
and also just a large dike sorry
yeah dude you missed your opportunity
all right you're calling a hold up
you're calling from a 330 area code who
are you where you calling from
hello 330 are you there
yeah yeah this is uh this is nicholas
from canon ohio
hey nicholas what's going on what's on
your mind
well so recently i've been doing a lot
of searching of the literature on
the on the issue of healthcare and
what's the most optimal approach
towards universal healthcare and i found
a
meta-analysis or rather systematic
review that i think that
a lot of your audience would be
interested in where it's titled
single-payer or multi-pair a systematic
review
okay and essentially what it does is
that it goes through
a lot of the literature where it goes
through 15 qualitative
and a whole bunch of quantitative
comparisons where they find
that basically when when compared
against each other
single-payer systems are the are the
most cost-effective
health care systems in the world and
it goes and it goes along with refu with
refuting this
fallacy that essentially the free market
is the most optimal approach to
everything because when you look at
a lot of the health economics literature
on on the issue kenneth arrow
wrote in the in the 1970s that actually
health health insurance is not is not
meant to be treat
treated as a commodity because there's
a difference in information between the
buyers
and the sellers of health insurance as
one of the many examples that he writes
in this paper
and so this this idea that we
that we can just continue to
take an incrementalist approach in
perpetuating
the affordable care act as opposed to
creating
a medicare-for-all system is just a very
large
fallacy and what i often find is that a
lot of people that
make these arguments don't aren't really
looking at
based off of the literature that
actually we don't
act on ourselves for this issue okay uh
nick real quick tell everybody the name
of the piece again
what'd you say tell everybody the name
of the piece again
it's called it's called single-payer or
multi-payer a systematic review
i believe it's in the journal of public
health thanks a million nick that's a
good call thank you
all right folks um we gotta i gotta
address this
um i haven't talked about lula de silva
on this show for a little while
but i will continue to cover it on this
show and of course
we covered a lot on tnbs um
but let me just reset a little bit why
this matters
so much and obviously some of it's
personal uh to me
i think that this is an incredibly
admirable
and important leader in the 21st century
and uh
the treatment of him is abysmal
and terrifying and a moral scar on the
world
but broadening out from that let's look
at a couple of variables
in play because there's the it goes to
several dynamics that we need to
understand and i'll give you the
new news in a second one is the ongoing
interference of the united states in
latin america which we're seeing come to
a head
in this intervention uh and pressure in
venezuela
uh through going back of course we all
know the history we know going back to
eisenhower backing coups in guatemala we
know that nixon backed the coup that got
rid of allende in chile we've known that
uh at least 48 if not more coups have
been backed by the united states in
latin america
as well as supporting in the condor
years in the 70s and 80s
coordinated death squads across
the region backed by the united states
and the cia involvement
in the uh juntas and mass murders
in central america under reagan in the
80s
through panama with bush and then in the
90s
into the arts which is what the pink
wave came out of was a paradox where
certainly under clinton and
bush ii uh well there was definitely
attempted coups with bush ii
and there certainly was a massive strong
arming
of latin american and caribbean
economies the clinton administration's
policies on cotton as an example did
enormous damage to haiti
and you also had a sort of a slight
stasis where at least center-left
governments could come into power
and if they played by what was then
consensus on market rules
they could use some of the excess of a
commodities boom
to invest in their people and then there
was another contingent as exemplified by
chavez who took a more aggressive
posture and then people like
rafael correa and ecuador who were in
the middle
but they all backed each other and they
all had a shared commitment to autonomy
and independence for latin america and
one that was not adversarial the united
states or europe it wasn't adversarial
to anybody
president lula was
equally at home and praised by george w
bush tony blair and barack obama
as he was by you know leaders in the
middle east and africa as well as being
widely admired across latin america so
and this leads to the second two parts
here
one again this presidency is
unparalleled
uh in terms of the 21st century the
historian perry
perry anderson said he probably is the
most successful president of this
century
that's important it's important on a
progressive show and if you want to be
in a progressive movement when any
leader lifts
between 30 and 40 million people out of
abject poverty when anybody
eliminates hunger in a country the un
had said there was a
serious hunger problem brazil after lula
is president because of serious
investment
there is no longer hunger in brazil and
then you look
at um as even as an example his attempts
to forge a deal with iran
on their uh nuclear weapons or excuse me
not their weapons their nuclear program
was a forerunner
to what ended up being negotiated so
this is an incredibly successful
president this is also a guy who grew up
homeless
and was a labor union leader who helped
liberate brazil from a military
dictatorship in the 1980s
so he also just by his very identity in
fact
represented a rebuke of brazil's elite
and ended up leaving office with a
mid-80s approval rating
and this is where the backlash and the
component of u.s foreign policy comes in
which is starting with
the clinton uh state department the
obama administration
okaying a coup against manuel zelaya and
honduras in 2009. manuel zelaya was on
the
uh lula end of the pink tide a moderate
center-left leader in honduras who
started working with the social
movements
and started understanding the need for
social investment
in fact when he was run out by the
military lula hosted him
uh provided him they provided him refuge
in the brazilian
embassy at the time
and while you know the dynamic with
venezuela was different
and there was a hugely aggressive
approach towards venezuela from bush and
obama
and the venezuelan government committed
uh achieved many great things under
chavez
but they also had problems as well as
any government is
lula uh played by these rules
and managed to create autonomy and lift
people out of poverty but ultimately it
came to a head with
an unwillingness to privatize key
strategic brazilian industries
like their oil reserves which as it
plays a
huge role in the shifting us posture
towards him and the workers party in the
dilma administration that came after him
and then the backlash from the brazilian
elites and so by this time
starting in like say 2012 and so you
have like
along with these broad sprawling
corruption investigations that only
focus on center left to left leaders
backed by the united states
which what they call law fair in brazil
the process that targeted lula
you also have the new version
of old cia propaganda which is things
like the atlas network which is funded
by the koch brothers
operating in brazil and other in
venezuela and elsewhere
to disseminate libertarian propaganda
and support far-right reactionary forces
in latin america
in 2016 there was a judicial process
that removed dilma rousseff from power
it was a coup
and it's broadly acknowledged as such
now
and then of course last summer we saw
lula in spite of all of this
leading by double digits in the polls he
was put in prison
uh literally for indeterminate acts that
was the phrase they used
sergio morrow the special prosecutor who
was backed by the justice department
here
essentially acknowledged that he had no
material evidence to jail lula
but just knew he felt it in his gut
that something was wrong so out of this
multi-billion dollar corruption
investigation that implicated all major
parties in brazil because there's
structural corruption in brazil which we
get to some other time which implicates
the whole political system certainly not
just the workers party
um one seaside condo which lula didn't
even own
and they couldn't even prove that he
literally even physically spent uh
time in he was put in jail for 12 years
barred for running
for president in a contradiction of all
international law
and not allowed to do public interviews
totally silenced
bolsonaro has been in power now for a
couple of months he was backed by
wall street backed by trump backed by
trudeau and so on
uh and there are now actual corruption
investigations emerging around bolsonaro
like
connections between his family and a
paramilitary gang that assassinated
marieli franco
besides all of which all the overt
corruption taking place
like the destruction of the amazon and
they have just taken this opportunity to
slap lula with another 12 year sentence
for i kid you not
kitchen renovations on a friend's house
again no proof that he even owned the
thing and also all of this took place
post-presidency so again you want to
take a global phenomenon maybe barack
obama shouldn't go on vacation with
richard branson
after he's president but he's not going
to go to jail for it
and nor should he this is shocking this
is also by the way
a couple weeks ago they did an exorcism
around lula's office these are
crazy demented dangerous people
who've criminalized the most important
president in brazil
and by extension latin america's history
and now we're attempting to
erase him from the public record in
entirety
um judge sergio moro the judge that
hounded and persecuted lula is now of
course justice minister
in this fascistic corrupt brazilian
government
and i will just say as an example in
this
new ludicrous ruling i'll quote briefly
now from brian mirren
brazil wire basically
again there was no evidence that lula
owned
the the home the judge who sentenced him
was not even in the jurisdiction where
the supposed client crime took place as
in the case this is quoting now briefly
as in the case of the gowara ujja
beachfront apartment used to arrest lula
at the outset of the 2018 election
season when he was leading the polls
investigators were unable to prove that
lula owns the property in question in
this case the property is legally
registered to the name
fernando bittar batar is a businessman
and son of one of lula's oldest friends
jacob bittar who's a former union leader
and ex-mayor of compenis compinus which
is a population of 1 million is the 11th
richest city in
brazil uh goes on to
explain um that again the
this was in a different uh judicial
system
and the other thing that's just kind of
funny
in this case is that the judge in their
ruling
um she made a lot of technical mistakes
including listing uh employees
and co-defendants in the case as two
different people
when they actually referred to one
different entity
like literally a company name was listed
as two different people in the case
so look we can get it you know dig into
more of the the details if you want to i
would suggest reading everything in
brazil wire but that is the big picture
context we're in
and in an even bigger picture all of
these fascist governments whether it's
drain the swamp whether it's
uh barr the most popular politician an
important politician in the country
running for president so you can
facilitate fascism whether it's
uh the mafia investigations that lead to
berlusconi in italy
it's all a shallow demogra a demagogic
anti-corruption politics that leads to
the far right
so people are going to need to get much
smarter about how we talk about
corruption
what that actually means and
specifically
what we're actually targeting because
right now generic anti-corruption
discourse
is the handmaiden of global fascism
and i will continue to say i mean
they're trying to make it so this man
he cannot even go see his family he's in
solitary confinement they want him to
die in prison
uh and there there are many other
examples which i don't have time to get
into him with ways in which they're even
just
ignoring brazilian legal precedent
to do this it's it's inhumane it's
disgusting
uh and all of us certainly with any pr
platform or any access to anything needs
to speak on it
and more people bernie uh spoke about it
in the spring
uh and barbara lee and roe conan other
than keith ellison and other good
congress people signed a letter
but there needs to be a hell of a lot
more done on this and please
do not ever send me some trash new york
times article
uh telling me that you know oh there's
another corruption investigation
um if you believe these cases
you're you know you're essentially
believing
um you know if if whitaker
and jeff sessions had unlimited power to
prosecute barack obama
and he was in jail while trump was
president but also he could run for a
third term but was barred for running
that's essentially what you're doing
um okay let's take another call you're
calling from a 647 area code who are you
where are you calling from
hey this is sebastian i'm calling from
canada hey sebastian what's going on
first of all i want to shout out the
live chat for calling me sebastian gorka
every time i call in
nice sounds like someone said some solid
solid material there
yeah in a certain sense uh next i want
to say
shout out to matt for the state of the
union drops oh that was amazing that
might have been
that might have been the single greatest
like one game performance by a live
stream producer
in the history of youtube that was my 81
point game yeah that was definitely an
81 point game it was also the only thing
keeping the rest of us from slitting our
wrists
but anyway i want to talk about how you
guys um you've done a really good job at
pointing out this like
white male conservative agreement
that like the most oppressed class
i think actually you know jesse lee
peterson said that the most suppressed
political class in the united states is
the
white christian conservative man of
power okay
and um and i think
the whole border non-crisis
the way that trump talks about it that's
the perfect example of that
um i mean for example we
um in this country seventy percent of
our murder victims are killed with
uh guns smuggled in from the u.s
and of course that's a fraction of
the price that mexico has had to pay
like the drug war in mexico has its
roots in the 1980s
but you can trace the escalation of
violence
into all the war in that country from
basically the um
the repeal of the or i guess the sunset
of the assault weapons ban
in the u.s um
you know in spanish they call the uh
the ak-47 the cop killer
because when you've outgunned the police
they just
i mean it's hopeless that they had a
call in the army
um and so the idea that like
that the us is somehow
i don't know the the effects are
detrimental it's just crazy
yeah um but yeah it's just an i think
the next like in a line of this and you
guys pointed out all the time the
the agreement of privilege basically
yeah i mean that's that's a major i mean
that certainly explains the republican
dynamic of it
um and that's who drives it um that's
you know probably about 30 or so percent
of the country
uh and then there might be some other
people who
are uh just
delusionally and incorrectly totally
mixed misdiagnosing their actual
problems
um and then getting you know
hood winked and diluted into blaming it
on something a problem that doesn't
exist
uh but yeah i mean that's it and by the
way if
if canada or actually mexico for that
matter because our guns
are fuel uh as you were saying uh
mexico a lot of the violence in mexico
the artillery is coming
in a fair amount of cases from the
united states if
if united states or canada
um i mean if canada and mexico
had the same policy set as the united
states did with regards to how we've
used drones in pakistan and yemen as an
example
they would be flying drones over gun
shops in arizona
uh without a doubt yeah thanks for the
call man um
all right let's let's actually
do this for a second um mike pompeo
is a extraordinarily uh
dangerous person uh and
always has been he was the koch brothers
congressman he was head of the cia he's
a
extreme far-right corporatist but i
think he also has some quite
pension uh extreme apocalyptic religious
views
and he has been obviously
very aggressive and we have to look to
it i mean the announcement of keeping
troops in
iraq to keep an eye on iran should be
setting off every type of alarm bell
imaginable
trump has been making noises and threats
about a coup in venezuela from the
beginning
let's just reiterate this again you can
have critiques of maduro
you have critiques of chavez i happen to
think chavez is a very defensible figure
but a far from perfect one
and you can also recognize the fact that
look the actual problems in venezuela
including corruption
cartels and all the rest of it none of
this is going to be solved or changed
by a far-right government backed by the
united states
and brazil and colombia i think that
should go without saying with a point
person whose history is death squads in
the 80s and elliott abrams
so that's why we oppose this coup effort
in venezuela
full stop full stop
there's and we can have the
conversations about venezuela and the
debates and so on that's great
u.s intervention there we oppose full
stop also
the remnants of the accomplishments
which have been greatly depreciated in
the last several years as a result of
both
sanctions in economic warfare and the
failures of maduro both and
would be almost certainly eliminated in
a u.s backed government
there still are some achievements that
live on there in terms of some
cooperatives on a local scale but you
can tell that the administration's
pulling out the heavy guns here because
this
myth this idea going back for quite some
time
uh in an attempt to sicario two
freak out americans uh mike pompeo
is on it on fox news do you have
concerns that
venezuela runs the risk of turning into
a no man's land
uh where you you have these bad actors
including um some with links to
hezbollah
that could be more of a threat because
they're in our hemisphere
yeah trish i'm glad you brought that up
people don't recognize that hezbollah
has active cells
the iranians are impacting the people of
venezuela and throughout south america
we have an obligation to take down that
risk for america okay so first of all
um it's unfashionable to say but
hezbollah has zero
operational interest in the united
states none
uh yes in the 1980s hezbollah was
definitely available uh
responsible for killing um marines in
lebanon
now i am that's terrible that that
happened
that's a bad thing i don't want anybody
to get harmed like that
um but if you can't see the difference
between
uh the complicated geopolitics and
guerrilla operations in a local zone
versus what he's implying there which is
more like al qaeda or isis types attacks
in the united states
you're being dishonest there is zero
zero zero zero evidence
that hezbollah has a desire uh to mount
some type of
911 style or any style attack like that
in the united states and in fact
part of this is reflecting its own
shifting politics in the middle east
because of what's happening in syria but
if i recall hezbollah sort of
somewhat mildly criticized the attacks
on charlie hebdo
if i recall correctly in an assyrian
context hezbollah is
actually with the iranians
uh uh protecting minority communities in
certain areas
from isis and then the second thing is
when you say
cells you're evoking an image of like
training camps it's ridiculous to the
extent
that what he's saying is remotely true
and this needs to be aggressively
fact checked might mean that there's
connections
between drug trafficking roots in
venezuela
and people who do finances for hezbollah
and if that is true
then that basically could be in a
statement that you probably could expand
to
um there are relationships
uh between drug cartel networks
everywhere to everywhere it's it's
you by the time you specify it it means
nothing
but he's doing his best to fear monger
they're in our hemisphere though
right they're in our hemisphere you know
vladimir putin's in our hemisphere
the uh in a big the northern hemisphere
i'm talking about
gotta worry about that too gotta worry
about a lot of hemispheres
nice hemispherical risks risks
hemispheric activity i mean look if you
have fact check
on i have never heard i saw one
uh far-right person from foundation for
the defense of democracy said something
about hezbollah
in venezuela to vice that was what we
could find
and then there is treasury department
which talks about cartel activities
and again cartel activities is a highly
expansive term
there's no doubt i think it's quite well
there's right
precisely talk about connection
possible direct or indirect connections
to cartels i'm not sure is something
that this administration wants to go
down going but
um yeah you're calling from a 443 area
code who are you where are you calling
from
uh this is aaron from baltimore aaron
what's going on what's on your minds
not too much i just want to say love
your show thanks man so i
love jamie's show auntie father and i'm
sorry matt having listened to the
literary hangover or whatever
but i did buy you know the house of
seven gables i'm gonna read that wow
so wait wait hold up hold up why don't
you start with the show doing work for
hufflepuff versus getting so
yeah that's that sounds a little
ambitious dude
start by subscribing
i get too many shows i need a book you
know
my ipod all right can't listen to all
your shows you know you know
i don't know about that i'm sure there's
other shows that you could lose in the
rotation
okay but anyways go ahead yes sir what's
on your mind i got
uh got two things uh one real quick
just wanted to give a shout out to my
friend amy who helped start
uh the sunrise movement in baltimore so
we're pushing for the
green new deal and we have so
anyone in the baltimore area check us
out on facebook
um you know we're going to be pushing
our congress members next week to sign
on to the green new deal
so awesome it's pretty cool yup what's
the other one
i just wanted the other thing so i've
i've watched the
empire files which someone recommended
on the chat one
time last week i think that's abby abby
martin's show
yeah yeah and so i you know it looks
to me like you know the creation of the
constituent assembly there was an
attempt to compromise and
all these things and obviously there's
an economic war where uh
where the global section you got to be
specific
where oh yes oh sorry
from the united states i don't know oh
yeah oh in in oh venezuela i'm sorry
what constitution okay what can you got
a what constituent
assembly assembly that was created in
like 2007
i think okay okay yep which was
viewed as like uh um the from the right
wing as
you know lula trying to move sorry um
maduro is trying to take over
not not the same dude okay so
and yes and there's been economics no no
problem there's been economic warfare
but what's the uh what
so what's the really my my point
my point is um uh you know and i've
heard you you've had some you said
there's some legitimate criticisms of
maduro
and i've been watching you know the
shows and i haven't really heard you go
into that really so
i would honestly go into past archives i
mean look i
i i've been trying to find
well last year i did an interview with
ava gollinger on this show that was much
more kind of fully fleshed out on
venezuela
and included some some very robust i
mean look the bottom line is
is under chavez you have a complex
uh historic figure and what he did
that was great was he took
oil that already was public oil by the
way venezuela had made its oil public
sector well before chavez
and he just came in and he did what you
need to do which is like you know what
this money's coming in and it's going to
instead of going to the wealthy and the
cronies it's going to the poor
and we're going to you know all the
things you need to do just redistribute
wealth give people health care education
they did incredible work on
literacy uh and he also had these
experiments
in direct democracy and workers
cooperatives now
my understanding of those is
there wasn't any quality control so
those things
really depended like
in certain areas those things were
enormous successes and showed a path
forward for what democracy really should
be
and a huge testament to the success of
the bolivarian revolution and then other
areas that just created different types
of patronage and corruption networks
then there's the bigger picture which is
there's actually features of the
venezuelan state
and it could be any state in this case
it's venezuelan
that uh you know
favored incumbent political parties that
had patronage networks
military connections to cartels and
things like that
that weren't structurally changed by
chavez so frankly in the same way that
and i and certainly i know more about
brazil it would be impossible
essentially to do this
but lula and dilma
did amazing things for people in the
context
of accepting some of the innate
corruption and disparities of brazilian
oligarchy which of course ended up
striking back and creating this counter
coup against them but they
chose to make the calculation of working
inside the context
to as best they could of brazilian
oligarchy and western capital to achieve
things for people
i think chavez in a very different way
actually made
some of the same calculations and then
by the time you get to maduro
um and and then chavez i think java's
you know there's
if you read david gollinger there's
personnel problems picking bad people
staffing things and like all sorts of
stuff that get into the nuances of
government and by the time you get to
mindoro taking over
the intensity of the warfare from the
united states is at such a high degree
oil prices have plummeted and these
programs haven't been
um you know there hasn't been a kind of
broader economic diversification
to keep money and investment flowing in
for these things plus
again you can never not emphasize u.s
economic warfare and coup mongering
and so you guys you have a guy you know
maduro
who it would take a genius
of unparalleled political talent maybe a
chavez to pull off that balancing act
and he hasn't been able to
and part of not being able to has been
some monetary schemes that totally don't
work and are ridiculous
part of that has definitely been
increasing state repression
uh which was always i would say was
there to some extent during chavez but
was lied about and exaggerated in the
united states
and the last couple years under maduro
it's become a lot more real
uh so yeah i mean and look the bottom
line is
i don't you know you're not uh
coups and threats are not going to
support somebody in governing better
um but so that's that's kind of like the
top line but i really i don't
i think right now in a coup context it
is not the time to emphasize
the failings of that government uh but
they're there we don't have to lie about
them or
shy from them yeah yeah i mean i'm on
board with that i was just trying to
get a you know bigger better frame sure
but
yeah thanks for taking michael oh thank
you lula libre lula levre
there you go ending on a very strong
note
um all right let's play these two other
clips uh these are also from
uh alexandria ocasio-cortez's
conversation on npr this morning
this is uh why she explains
uh the concept of and again this is
another one of like really
npr not under okay externalities should
be in the general discourse but
it hasn't been because we've lived in
neo-liberal nonsense land and alexander
ocasio-cortez explains to npr
what externalities are and what
economics does not measure
as you know congresswoman one reason
that people who are politically
conservative are skeptical of efforts to
combat climate change
is that it sounds to them like it
requires massive government intervention
which they just don't like
are you prepared to put on the table
that yes actually they're right what
this requires is massive government
intervention it does
it does yeah i have no problem saying
that why
because we have tried their approach for
40 years
for 40 years we tried to let the private
sector take care of it they
said we got this we can do this the the
forces of the market
are going to force us to innovate except
for the fact that there's a little thing
in economics called
externalities and what that means is
that
a corporation can dump pollution in the
river and they don't have to pay for it
and taxpayers have to pay
for cleaning up our air cleaning up our
water and saving the planet
and so we've already been paying the
costs
except we have not been getting any of
the benefit and so what we're here to
say is that government is not just for
cleaning up other people's mess
but it's also for building solutions in
places where the private sector will not
there it is so and it's also uh
what's funny about the the pretext of
that question is it it belies such a
fundamental lack of faith in democracy
i mean there's a substitute words you
could use for sort of government in that
sense
is the ability of a polity to solve big
problems
and not be at the whim of extractive
private end
entities that have an incredibly narrow
and highly short-term
sense of interest which is quite
literally making the planet
uninhabitable and
but there's also definitely a visionary
and moral dimension to this and she
really weaves these quite well
here she is contrasting the green new
deal
with the white nationalism of donald
trump
do you feel that you know how to take
the great fame that you have won over
the last several months
and turn that fame into power
no i think that
part of where i am right now is that i'm
learning i think
that really what i hope we're able to do
as a party and as a nation is rediscover
the power of public imagination
i think that this is a very special
moment and frankly
that is something that that i think the
president did do
in that he was able to take his profile
and say here's this hugely impossible
thing
that seems ridiculous
but i'm going to seriously push for it
and for him that's his wall
and obviously i can i'm diametrically
opposed to it
but i think that the reason he's so
attached to this thing
despite the fact that it's not what
voters want despite the fact that it's
not what the american people want
is that it's the only vision he has
he has no other picture of america
except an america with a huge wall on
the southern border
and i think that what we have a
responsibility to do
is show what in another miracle looks
like
okay let's take all of that political
energy
all of that resource that will go into
building
a massive second medieval wall
on our southern border and what if we
actually took all that concrete and
poured it into roads what if we took all
of that engineering and dedicated it
to new energy what if we took all of
that
but actually invested in something that
will have
payback and a return on our investment
for the american people
exactly and also and it's great too that
she doesn't um
people have gotten so burned out on hopi
changy rhetoric because it's been
attached
to insufficient and sometimes even just
really bad policies
it's great that she's still keeping that
kind of visionary dimension with the
actual
substance of a real transformative
democratic new deal a
green new deal and uh yeah i mean
what a catastrophic racist and stupid
vision trump's
vision is uh let's i'm confident who
will win out
she should get a she should work up a
fdr impression
i don't i don't know i don't know how
we're gonna i can't
it sounds like i'm what i assume i don't
know steve but it's a dumb
 question hey steve
how about you get the out of my
office and then record
10 minutes about how long the trip is to
the
congressional cafeteria we were
listening to this full interview and
prep this morning and it was like the
classic like
dumb middle brow npr filler before they
started
asking her questions about like spending
or whatever like how are you gonna pay
for it it was all like
the window opened revealing a slight ray
of sunlight in the
dynamic freshman congressman you're just
like shut the up and do your
interview
walking is a big part of alexandria
ocasio's routine
as she sits in the furthest
i can't even get through this yeah i
know it's because the cia is like keep
as much of this about
uh things besides politics as we can
right
yeah and i mean and you're just sitting
there just like just like oh my you're
the wind-up is so ridiculous that you're
like sitting there like oh my god can
you get to your
your your dumb deficit question already
because then at least
we'll get like talk about the deficit do
something
yeah because well with aoc don't you
want to ask how she's going to afford it
it is interesting because like
previously those questions like don't
ask the democratic politician that
because they're going to have to
like repeat some pablum that is going to
irritate us but now it's like yes get to
that question so that
the democratic politician can actually
answer why it's a dumb question right
she'll explain why it's a dumb question
if you just get to it quickly
um jay cool hey michael do you know much
about el salvador's new president niab
buckle or have thoughts on political
direction there thanks for the great
work you guys do i know
nothing except for i think that they
have opposed
a coup in venezuela so that's an
enormously brave move
uh i could look into it more the uh
howard schultz
uh platform speech at purdue university
is ongoing right now in a quote from
dave weigel
health care costs are the biggest driver
of unaffordable care
don't piss down my back and tell me it's
raining
i mean he's he
is the you know we were playing the
drops earlier when and he said something
like i'm not in bed with any special
interest and it's like dude
you literally are the special interests
i guess he doesn't sleep in bed then
yeah i guess like the point of all this
is to keep you away from
government
right that is the whole point of
everything is to get i mean my god
all of you not only out of government
but i would also like to say
off of tv you know what the the internet
is more democratized howard schultz
wants to have a youtube channel
where he puts out highly produced dumb
nonsense
videos where he whines about his taxes
being increased and he overpays a bunch
of yes people
to do dumb deficit videos and they get
300 views great
no the idea that he is getting a cnn
town hall
should evoke questions of the crudest
pay-for-play ideas
possible i don't know i don't know but
it is if and look if he's getting one
ever i was going to say look all right
if kamal harris getting one i want to
see elizabeth warren and bernie sanders
get one because those are other
frontline democratic candidates
howard schultz is getting one i want
tulsi gabbard
i want julian castro i want cnn
subpoenaed i want
subpoenaed i want to see all of their
records i want
um i want the rent is too damn high guy
if he mounts a candidacy i'm much more
interested in what he has to say than
what howard schultz has to say
it is ridiculous if they're
giving him a platform he has no public
support
no public interest the only people that
have any direct benefit from him
are the consultants that are gonna hose
him and
if the democrats nominate an actual
progressive candidate
and wall street and the oligarchs have a
meltdown he will sink
an enormous amount of money uh into
uh handing re-election as best he can to
george w bush
excuse me donald trump and make no
mistake that's what the play is
because i refuse to believe i get i
think howard schultz is an
incredibly delusional divorced reality
person but
i'll give him some credit here i do not
think he is dumb enough to think he is
going to win the presidency
i don't i don't i really don't
so this whole charade
is a threat from the oligarch class of
this country and it's conduits on all
the corporate media outlets
that you know what democratic party you
better not nominate
a bernie sanders or an elizabeth warren
who's serious about these issues
if you do this is going to go
around the country
we're going to fund money to him he's
got his own bank account
he's going to get endless media coverage
even though he'll never poll
above single digits i confidently
predict
and he might though this is when it
starts to get this this micro stuff at
the electoral college
maybe he does steal some suburban votes
in pennsylvania
you know maybe he does that and make no
mistake
it is to ensure donald trump is
re-elected
because they will prefer fascism over
the left because they
only care about their money at the end
of the day but
because trump is so disgusting and so
despicable
they want plausible deniability even
inside themselves
that they're not actually doing this but
nobody thinks
including howard schultz that he is ever
going to sit
at the desk in the oval office
it's disgusting the game these people
are playing
take their guys it's lazy too
because i'm reading i'm reading wiggle
right now and he's saying
i mean we'll definitely have some more
howard schultz content for everyone
tomorrow
but apparently a big pillar of his
platform is going to be
speaking out and regulating
gerrymandering which he
can't do as can i president
so is this like already like we is this
are we already in like accidental
mussolini territory here like wait are
you saying that you're gonna personally
engineer state courts
you if you want to it's going to
help that give arie berman like a
billion dollars
yeah yeah if you're concerned about
democracy yeah
no arie boom no not harry melbourne
almost is the nice jewish boy for voting
yes right trying to think of a rap line
that ari uh melbourne could spin for
gerrymandering no no don't that's what
we're trying to do don't yeah don't
reward that behavior gotta split up blue
and red
all weird like crips and bloods airy
melber
uh anti uh gerrymander rap tour
uh that's uh yeah that's probably the
type of bold innovative thinking
yeah that howard schultz would bankroll
you're calling from a 248 area code who
are you where are you calling from
oh is this is this me i'm sorry i know
you guys hate when people ask that
no it's fine what's up what's your name
where are you calling from
i'm calling from massachusetts
originally from
uh detroit michigan cool what's your
name and um
i've been austin austin and uh
yeah i started watching you guys like a
couple weeks ago and uh
the first video i saw from you guys was
actually
you uh dunking on dave rubin and uh it
was like
nice something about uh ben shapiro not
wanting to
bake a cake for him oh yeah yep and uh
who knew
it just cracked me up because you're
doing anything for a while i was kind of
sorry what no sorry i'm sorry go ahead
for a while you were kind of what
for a while i was kind of sucked into
that kind of idw
kind of web for a little while
right and so like i don't know um you
know i kind of considered myself
a centrist for a little while but i
think what i really was was just
a leftist but you know i was kind of too
afraid to
admit that because you know it's kind of
it's kind of tough to
put yourself in a position where you
know if you're if you truly
believe in your convictions you know you
have to
stop being friends with certain kind of
people or you know
um you know can't hang out with certain
kind of people so it's kind of
or even or maybe even if you do like
because i'm not a big you know i joke
about it but whatever like be you know
be friends with who you're friends with
but even just like the
it eliminate i notice in certain groups
it does eliminate a lot of social
niceties like when somebody
repeats a piety or a cliche like oh well
both sides or some like that
and you are the one to be like well
actually no like what do you mean like
you
wait you think when howard schultz says
that democrats calling for medicare for
all
is an equivalent to putting children in
cages that's an example of both sides
being irrational like are you actually
saying something that
you know immoral and catastrophically
stupid you know
it yeah it makes conversation a little
bit more difficult when you don't just
sort of nod your head along with the
um but uh welcome aboard oh yeah welcome
aboard austin
yeah thank you and you know the kind of
um i'm also a
former sam harris kind of a
i guess fanboy and i guess listening to
you just like dunk on him enough just
kind of made murals yeah this guy kind
of is this like a
whiner you know trust fund baby you know
it's like always playing the victim card
and
yep you know it was right around when he
started referring to himself
and you know majid nawaz and ben shapiro
and jordan peterson as this like
intellectual dark web you know that just
you know my initial reaction to that was
just like i cringe that that you know
that's embarrassing
it's so smart it's embarrassing it's
embarrassing because like
you know especially from my point of
view you know i'm somebody who used to
you know when i was in high school i
used to go on you know like
4chan and you know all that kind of
so you know when i
you know i was very familiar with that
kind of stuff so when he started
saying like that i was just like oh
man just stop
this is like it just kind of made me
realize just like how flawed his uh
perspectives and you know you kind of
just like made me see that even more
i mean i'm working i'm unfortunate i've
got this book that's going to be out in
the summer
about not just the id it's a critique of
the idw but it's also a kind of
cosmopolitan socialist
answer to a lot of the questions that
arise around the idw so
it includes the the symptom this
power this you know because it's like uh
you know it's it's a
this whole popularity this thing is
obviously a symptom of bigger problems
that's why you would live in a
society where people want to read you
know jordan peterson or something
but also you know it's it is interesting
though in terms of just kind of micro
like even in short-term history and like
when sam harris came on the scene he was
writing
i mean both that there was an enormous
amount of fear
and lack of information and just sort of
ranked stupidity about muslims
so on one hand his just kind of like
aggressive bigotry towards them along
with the
pseudo-sophisticated thought experiments
and the substitution for like
word games and hypotheticals over policy
and history could work
but then on the other hand it was also
like you know it was just so
simple it's just you know i'm an atheist
you know and and to be fair i get and
you know i mean we always say this i
know that these issues don't matter as
much to me as it does to other people in
some ways
i certainly matter about people being
brought up
in religious environments that are
harmful to them and i don't want
religion of any kind legislating for
sure
but you know i don't know if some if the
president says god bless america i don't
i don't have a this is this does not put
me into connections for days to just me
right yeah but that being said maybe
high school uh
richard dawkins viewing austin might
have cared about that but uh
fortunately i grew out of that right so
i just you know so i but it was just
interesting though that
he was riding this really open
mileage of on one hand these really a
historical
vicious stupid stuff about islam and
muslims on a policy
and historical arena and then on the
other hand just sort of like
this open and super simple lane of just
like hey i'm an atheist as
actually ironically basically a form of
identity politics if we're being blunt
about it yeah it is
it really is and then and you know and
then i and even then i didn't really
understand it because hitchens gave you
the same thing but hitchens was fun and
hitchens is a great writer and
all the rest of it and a rock on tour
but
then now it's like
i mean obviously he's got his own weird
intellectual fixations and that's why he
gets into the race though and you know
he's
i don't he's a bizarre guy i still
haven't kind of figured him out but i
think
oh yeah that was also when i started uh
falling off the train
you know i saw he had charles murray
gone there and i was like whoa what
what are you doing man you know just
kind of one of those moments i put my
hands on my head and i'm like what are
you doing dude like this is
but for those not someone you should be
associating with definitely and for sam
harris i think for those guys that it
is as matt would say it's like you know
you
the difference is on the left you
historicize and the right you
mythologize
and some people also might not like this
but if you use scientism as an ideology
it's a distinct from scientific
method that becomes its own form of
mythology and people like sam harris
were boxed in because
they didn't have the intellectual
capacity or empathy to grow
into the conversations that people are
having today and by the way i'm not
saying
there still might be strong
disagreements i'm not saying like become
a particular type of left or whatever
but all he did was just kind of become
and that whole scene just sort of
degraded into lazy reactionary politics
because
there wasn't the emotional empathy or
intellectual capacity
to take on the issues of the day it was
all just quite literally
reactive um and there wasn't anything
novel to add to any of the conversations
so that's how it worked out i'm glad you
found us
thanks brother that's awesome so
we're getting more and more of those
calls and it's sort of
making me revise our position which was
like you don't really convert people
we're getting the point where i think
people do and you have to think about
the way people approach these things for
the first time
it's sort of how people watch local news
thinking they're being informed about
their community but they're not they're
being informed about like whatever the
local police department has to give them
right and whatever like the meteorology
is maybe some news and then whatever
um decent video that one of their
reporters could wrangle up and it might
be even from like a national corporate
headquarters so
but but people still think they're
getting informed and they leave
watching the news as if they have been
informed right and the idw is all about
like yeah let's have these conversations
we're gonna have these hard
conversations we're gonna get into the
nitty-gritty we're going to love
nuance and they're selling themselves
and people if they don't know what that
stuff actually looks like
what actually getting into like
historical size and stuff they might
think that that's it and then you get
that sort of like dunning-kruger effect
where like
we're the brain geniuses we've thought
through all this stuff rationally but
really
no you've been living inside of like a
walled garden where you're pretending to
do all that stuff precisely but that's
and then that's also where the ben
burgess critique of the left comes in
where it's like
you know i mean look i i've no problem
condemning them on their ethics and i do
um but also actually taking the time to
dissect and really pick apart their
arguments
and even also acknowledge areas of
vulnerability where
we're falling short that they're
exploiting disingenuously of course
um but really taking it apart and again
i can tell you this yes in addition to
the calls
i've had plenty of other anecdotes where
it's like
it was some combination of
a failing of certain kind of pop forms
of leftism
to deal with you know certain not even
arguments just a kind of
off-putting sort of ethos
uh combined with you know
a sort of fake you know the
pseudo-intellectualism of that scene
and then as simple as yeah but then i
you know started watching you guys or i
found zero books or something like and
yeah i'm done those guys are schmucks
uh okay angel i have you i heard that
steve
king brought diamond or silk to the
state of the union i wonder how they
chose did she just say
after everything trump said how much did
steve king pay here
these are all legitimate questions i
think it was a coin toss actually
it made it sounds about right colin from
nebraska i was discussing the green new
deal how to pay for it dilemma with my
roommate he asked me that while adding
many of the
while that adding that many of the
resources the transport high speed rail
parts involve colon oil i tried to
encourage him to look past the money
aspects
but had trouble with the colon oil part
how would you say it'd be better to use
colon oil
to implement the green new deal versus
ignoring solutions to help
human society i mean i i don't think
even people who have the most aggressive
plans for climate
i think if somebody told you literally
within 48 hours we could stop using coal
and oil
that is not it's not even not feasible
it's just not i mean unless we just
decided that we're just like going to
sit around which maybe we should decide
to do that but yes i mean
even the most aggressive transition is
going to involve some extractive
processes to do these things there's
no doubt now maybe there's some good
technical answers about how to do that
in a much lower impact way which i don't
know
um kentucky fried comrade now that we're
past the right wing
challenge to pelosi's speaker with
pelosi snubbing of the green new deal as
well as clarification that she was
clapping trump's statement can we
discuss the medium-long need for find a
future speaker who actually represents a
left agenda
i don't know if it's at the top of the
list right now but i mean supposedly i
mean didn't
nancy pelosi say that she's done in 2020
didn't she already say that
or am i totally misfiring that i thought
it was two
terms she said she would commit two
terms yes
somebody from the left should be house
speaker
the really the the much bigger problem
in my estimation that happened this last
congress i don't even remember what the
title was maybe it was a conference
chair or something but
fourth seed the fourth seat going to
hakeem jeffries over barbara lee
it really sticks in my craw that was a
signal for sure that was a signal so yes
uh but the real way you do that i mean
it's i'm sorry i'm not adding new
insight but like
keep getting more left-wing people in
congress and then having them organize
for power
local pizza historian what do you guys
think about kamala harris is shamelessly
plugging her converse when vans is where
it's at
talk about how do you do fellow kids
i thought that was i thought she really
did herself in
with the converse
um i'm your cuckleberry leftist friends
tell me that they're hesitant to support
bernie or warren because they want to
win and they think kamala harris etc
have a better chance
what's to make you all say that any what
makes you all say that anyone can beat
trump
then the argument i hear is that is that
everyone thought hillary would win well
i don't okay this sounds like a jacob
wall
yeah this just sounds like look i mean
you first of all you should tell your
friends they're way in their head and
they need to just like get outside this
and look the reason i mean honestly like
the reason that take a walk
splash some water in their face the
reason that i say it is because
every historical marker like okay
to be honest if i was trusting my gut in
2016 more i would have been
less confident about hillary clinton
winning
than i projected i was to be honest with
you it always
felt to me atmospherically and looking
at the country like
this could be a real problem
that being said and i don't say this as
like an
excuse for their catastrophic campaign
strategy
she won the polling was not
really that far off base it wasn't like
the poll said hillary clinton is gonna
win and then trump won like a five
million person popular vote
he got and this is where look steve
manon i think is
frankly mostly full of but one
thing that he was totally right about
was
essentially like we need to flip a
highly
uh geographically specific amount of
seats in
this part of the electoral table and
they did it
so okay people need to
don't under learn the lessons of hillary
but don't overlearn and have the wrong
lessons
second part is is uh trump is
consistently polling under 50
historically if you're in your third
year heading into reelection
and you're that low it's not good that
is not good news now conversely the
economy is quote unquote
doing well but we already know that
that doesn't really reflect full reality
and so in fact
ironically trump who got mileage in that
broad populist way
it was a better position to be in in
2016 to say america isn't already great
there's a lot more that needs to be done
but
but guess what he has to do now
i mean he's gonna have to go to all
these other places where he stoked
misdirected populist anger in addition
of course he'll double up on the racism
and xenophobia which is
horrifying and potent and the base of
republican politics but not enough
again it's been proven again and again
it's not enough to win a national
election
bill flitcher said that to me within
weeks
of uh trump's election he said this is
catastrophic
but you need to see in the vote totals
that this
is not a majority right now
so what and then what is he going to do
with the populism stuff is he going to
keep railing i mean he'll try
maybe but he's also going to brag about
his record and then
in so far as it matters every single
frontline democrat
leads him in the polls so
i mean i you know and and i and i say
this to
my fellow bernie people don't make the
argument that only bernie can beat him
that's dumb
from all available evidence any of these
candidates could beat them
now i have a couple of candidates that i
would be
a little bit less confident about than
others
but honestly none of that is ideological
right like i think bernie could
definitely beat him and i think kamala
harris could definitely beat him and i
think joe biden could definitely beat
him
and i think uh
yeah i think pretty much all the
frontline ones could definitely beat him
then there's some other ones like
legitimately you know i don't know
really start digging the barrel here
i don't know about mike bloomberg okay i
don't know about terry mcauliffe right
but it is just every side of that
equation is
not the conversation to be having right
now get out of your house
tell your friends politely and with love
to go take a walk
all right let's play two more uh quick
pieces of sound
trump misspeaks a lot but was this a
freudian slip
many of our greatest strides from
gaining our independence
to abolition of civil
rights to extending
the vote for women
have been led by people of faith and
started in prayer abolition
did he just not want to say the word
slavery
and correct it to civil rights or
something a lot of this speech was about
uh trafficking and they were calling it
human slavery
so i think he was like oh maybe uh
wait i thought how can it be abolished
if we're talking about it right now
um let us
let's see let's do this um
let's play clip number eight
uh this is important this is wonky but
this is important this is a good
i would say this is a good preset
for how to get really specific
on uh with candidates
as they run for office and we already
see this of course we saw a catastrophic
talk with nancy pelosi's policy advisor
under
undermining medicare for all then we saw
the terrible move by the pod save guy
uh trying to make it
a generic thing versus a specific thing
abdul al-sayed
obviously we very enthusiastically
supported his run for governor of
michigan he ran a good campaign
unfortunately came up short but this is
a very young very talented guy who
is going to keep contributing for quite
some time
and he's doing it right now here he is
on rebel headquarters
tyt show explaining the difference
between
the center for american progresses
proposal on medicare extra
versus single-payer universal health
care how popular medicare for all is
it's polling 60 to 70
depending upon the poll that you're
looking at and
a lot of folks who are cozy with the
insurance industry are thinking well
how can we have our cake and eat it too
how can we make sure that these health
insurers that by the way are big donors
to democratic and republican campaigns
how do we keep them happy
and so they're taking the name medicare
for all and they're putting extra stuff
in it one plan
uh that's um that's pushed forward by
the center for american progress is
called medicare extra for all
and you'd think that if it's medicare
extra it'd be better than medicare right
because it's extra
that's not the case at all what it does
in effect is brings back the idea of the
public option if you think back to
the time when we were debating the
affordable care act there was a question
about the public option and end up
getting stripped
the obama administration couldn't push
that through what medicare extra for all
is
is in effect a public option it allows
you to buy into
medicare if you're a company or if
you're an individual
here's the problem though that keeps us
for with medicare for some because of
course
some people aren't going to be able to
afford it the big problem we have in our
society right now is that medicaid
covers folks who uh make up up to 133
percent
of poverty which is not very much at all
and then after that there's this big
donut hole between when
uh the the people can actually have
access because they can afford
uh health care on the exchanges and then
of course there's medicare for people
over the age of 65.
um medicare extra is is not going to
really solve that problem all it does is
introduce
a competitive uh publicly funded or
publicly subsidized public option
and that's not enough we need to make
sure that anything that we call medicare
for all
implies that it covers all everybody uh
you shouldn't have to buy in you
shouldn't have to worry about whether or
not your employer got it
you shouldn't have to worry about how
much money you make or whether or not
you can afford it free right now we know
medicare for all is so popular because
people get the basic idea it's medicare
for everybody
medicare you know medicare extra won't
be medicare for everybody it'll be like
you said medicare for some
um and it's not going to deliver on the
promise of medicare for all so there's a
real political challenge there
and like you said look the reason
medicare for all matters so much
is because it breaks the kind of
collusion power that
big insurance has with big health care
and
if we just had another private system or
medicare for some
it's not going to do that so we're not
going to get the major cost savings
we're going to miss out on being able to
provide health care for everybody
so that's exactly right that's well put
um
and it's something to have a lot of
precision about when you talk to
candidates i mean we've seen
obviously the two famous examples so far
kamala harris had an
excellent answer at the cnn town hall on
medicare for all
about private let's move past it let's
go we got to get this done
the next day she reversed herself uh
cory booker came out said he supports
medicare for all
uh you know because of course he's a
co-sponsor of bernie's
bill in the senate which would lead to
real medicare for all but then the next
day
uh his team clarified no he does not
want to get rid of private uh insurance
it needs to happen and not only does it
need to happen the actual further
reaches this conversation is what
next part of the healthcare sector
becomes public
so that pharma as an example which just
privately sort of accesses
and makes and absorbs public comments
most
innovation and medical research is
publicly funded and delivered
and then pharma profits off of it almost
essentially as intellectual property and
marketing companies
we need to stop that too and put health
care in democracy's hands across the
board
there's some very simple facts that
anytime someone is talking about
dismantling this industry that you can
just point to and prove that it's been a
failure
and that it needs to be seriously
reformed no
none of this like cow towing bs so 62
of bankruptcies are due to medical debt
70 of those people with that debt
have insurance that is astounding
yup done and also one in three
uh fund drives fundraisers on gofundme
are for medical debt that's not a
functioning system
we need single-payer universal health
care the the case is
overwhelmingly moral and i want to make
it on those terms it's also
if you want to go there it is the
obvious indisputed i mean
there are both social political
historical but also bureaucratic
and logistical reasons why every single
other industrialized country
has some version of this to greater or
lesser degrees and that the ones
that perform best are more and more
public and and the chapeau guys made a
good point on this talking about the
johns
uh if you're if you're already uh
you know hedging on what your plan is
and your politics
you're not in the room yet you can't act
like you're in the room because that's
what we did in 2016
and lost because there was no driving
message behind
hillary clinton's candidacy you're not
in the room you're on the trail
you're calling from an 832 area code who
are you where are you calling from
uh my name is david and i'm calling from
austin texas
hey david what's going on what's on your
mind yep what's on your minds
hey um i have been in pro-palestinian
politics for a long time since uh
the lebanon war with the july war in
2006
and it's been very distressing to see
where the pro-palestinian movement is
going with bds
why um bds has shown
a lot of evidence that it's ineffective
why
and that it's not helping how well if
a foreign direct investment to israel is
at an all-time high
israel's gdp is looking good so wait
wait wait wait
hold on hold on hold it so are you
saying
that the bds should be even
more aggressive and effective or are you
saying it shouldn't be used as a tool
because
israel still has a lot of fdi what are
you saying i'm saying one i
i i'm certainly for boycotts divestments
and
sanctions of um
of settlement products but okay so
you're sorry okay
so you're somebody who oppo okay so i
just because we don't have much time so
i just got to clarify this
you're somebody if i understand you
correctly
you are on the side of a some type of
two-state solution
you don't feel comfortable you don't
feel comfortable
with a boycott that takes on
israel as a whole and you want stuff
that only has to do
okay not totally what i want i want
something that's effective i am
for a two-state solution and that's
probably the main thing i don't see that
advocating for one state
or for the return of five million
palestinian refugees
is going to lead to a solution anytime
soon
it's going to allow israel to continue
the occupation all right so here's
so here's the answer to what you're
saying okay
and this is and so i'm i'm somebody who
supports
i at the end of the day support a full
binational democracy for everybody for a
couple of reasons i mean one ultimately
i do too right so one well no that
wouldn't be a two-state solution
but that being said well hold on
i'm gonna answer i'm gonna answer your
question um
but i'm not i mean there is an
ideological component to it but there's
also the component that israel has made
a two-state solution
literally impossible logistically so
they because of just never-ending
expansion of settlements
and so the fact that we could even
frankly
and the whole gaza spin of like oh
we took over we took out sentiments in
gaza no israel controls gaza 100
israel has gaza as a prison under
israeli policy so
my position i mean look
you say bds doesn't work nothing has
worked
literally nothing has worked so so
there's one potential posture here
uh and i i i have different feelings
about it because in general like
i don't really i think sanctions are a
form of violence and there's some types
of boycotts and lack of engagement i
have problems with i don't
you know i think people generally should
travel in between places
i think that people should be doing
academic work together i think that
there are you know things that
are important and healthy and
if i oppose them elsewhere i oppose them
as applied to israel that being said the
closest analog
to israel is definitely apartheid south
africa
and ultimately that was the strategy
uh that helped transition apartheid out
of apartheid to democracy
now it's gonna be much harder in
israel's case both because israel has
obviously the unending full support of
the united states and
also because israel itself is pivoting
so that when
people like ahud almert nehu barak said
hey we can't be an apartheid state it's
bad
for our brand the right in israel and
netanyahu saying we can build alliances
with hungary we can build alliances with
the new fascists in europe
certainly the republican party voters
don't give a about racial
oppression
so it's a very hard question and i don't
know all the strategic answers but i do
know bds is part of it on some level i
appreciate the call
um that's going to be the final call of
the day because we are running kind of
tight
um i'm s let me see maybe i'll take
yeah i can't get to everybody but i will
take one final call just because they've
been on for 70 minutes you're calling
from a 917 area code
with the final call of the day 917 are
you there
[Music]
went out of my way for you 917. and
you blew it
uh okay all right i will take one other
final call of the day you're calling
from a 4-1-3 area code
with the final call of the day are you
there
hello this is me dammit and don't you
forget it boy
okay what's on your mind yeah hi uh yeah
rachel's great so great to see in
amherst
for the next few hours awesome so fab to
see you all
oh man okay i was gonna say
one real quick thing uh i really hope
that we will hear
more impressions of senator ed mackie
uh given that he's on the new the green
new deal
epic request epic and second
thing that is a whole another can of
worms for another time
uh digging into uh foreign policy nuance
or the
absolute lack thereof of rokhana
that i could talk about four hours but
maybe another time
okay let's focus on getting ro khanna to
call for freeing lula though
i'm a little i'm more interested in that
oh yeah no i actually i even gave a
snappy reply
to you and sing like you know because uh
lula was a fan of you know he was tight
with obama would
would connor even get would he even like
lift a
okay that was me being cynical but just
saying that
i mean for his uh anti-interventionist
policy it's it's like just as a
philosophy it's really great for yemen
because that's just
you need to be a jackhammer on that just
to stop
genocide but in so many other cases
there's
a lot of like nuance that he misses out
on
and i hear what you're saying
i mean i don't i mean i think he can
change he's even like
we've chatted over ukraine on on twitter
and i mean i
i i would be bullshitting if i said i
had any reason
to any connection to why he doesn't
really call it uh
uh maidan aku anymore it's more like he
just stopped doesn't hang out with jimmy
dore the way he used to
but again i feel like he's someone with
a lot of great things going in domestic
policy and
in some areas like yemen he's really
really a valuable
voice and actor but i just think that he
could he could do more he could be
better i think
figuring out how that works i hear what
you're saying and obviously i agree with
you that he's a smart guy and i think
honestly regardless of
particular positions it's great i mean
it's awesome you're engaging with him
and it's awesome that you know whether i
mean
it's great that the team is responding i
i will say though i do think that
especially in a situation like venezuela
the job profile of a congress person is
different
and you have to oppose
what's happening there period right so
so it's i i like
bernie's take on that because it i don't
know maybe you call it like
but bernie's take is still opposing he
recognizes
yeah yeah but bernie steak is still
opposing it and for what it's worth
yeah yeah i don't i don't yeah i just
don't i don't see it and i i think the
ukraine
example ukraine example is more
complicated and i don't
we just can't get into that right now
but i do think even even there
i was somebody who had a lot of you know
i was i of course
i oppose nato expansion blah blah all
the things that i oppose and everybody
knows i oppose but i was much more
in that case because because honestly
con it was it was actually the inverse
right this was
this is russia's version of their monroe
doctrine oh yeah so i was much more
willing
to to kind of put out that critique that
being said
uh of course i don't want to ramp up
arms shipments
to ukraine and also i don't and also i'm
quite
receptive you know the the u.s backed
ukrainian government is not one i
support either at all so
you know but i think that ro khanna
especially right now within a span of a
couple weeks look if ro khanna
and this would have been made this would
have been cool if he started talking
about venezuela a year ago and he said
look
there's an economic warfare going on
there
this government has achieved some great
things under chavez and it's also got
some
serious problems and some serious real
failings there needs to be a broad
diplomatic process that is not an
intervention
but is a co-facilitation to create
something better that preserves the
gains of the bolivarian revolution but
also reopens
democracy that would have been
the best case scenario but right now
with literally what's happening the
bottom line he needs to convey is no ku
noku no ku
and i i just think that that's the
bottom line right now
all right okay i was gonna say syria but
that can talk that can be
later that can be later you you're
coming with all of the good stuff here
right in the last year yeah well i know
i was
um wait i was i was uh getting pizza at
antonio's when i
called you up and i've been waiting
online for like an hour and a half since
then but

good okay thank you so much
uh thanks to everybody who came to the
tnbs live show all right folks

hey michael uh
given your uh oh see
given your track record of dunking on
sam harris
uh just want to let you know that some
french
psychological uh sorry just want to let
you know that some french
social psychologists are studying what
they call the new secularism it's being
studied in a similar vein as bob
altameyer's work on the new right
authoritarianism
a recent study demonstrated new
secularism's explanatory relationship to
social dominance and prejudice towards
north africans
if that research is in english i need to
find it
maybe you could email uh thank you
that's
enormously helpful and interesting nick
from manitoba easy
waguan my dude keep slaying the haters

show is hilarious yes definitely he was
at the live show
mo brains michael i know so many young
people joined the military for lack of
education or economic opportunity if
they had another option they would take
and imagine
what a ccc or wpa program in service of
a green new deal
would do absolutely i love how uh it
would be amazing i love how kamala
harris
touts her support for medicare expansion
at the green new deal but won't support
a redistributed tax policy to pay for it
huge red flag there yes in
deed uh okay
let me see gotta make this good
the final
i am of the day of course apologies
cannot get to all of these
uh i'm
see okay i'll just end with this

will change
those not named illan omar or rishi i'd
also say
