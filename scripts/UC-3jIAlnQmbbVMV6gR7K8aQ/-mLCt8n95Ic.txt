oh we have footage of ilano mar
uh yeah this is weird uh because i've
been told that alan o'mara's plan is to
have us all engage in sharia law
um and um
something we need to take seriously
and here she is at
pride day twin cities i believe it's gay
pride
dancing she's dancing is that some type
of like sharia signal
telling them through this dance that
they're gonna be beheaded in
approximately nine years
yeah oh this is uh oh i know it's an
invitation to the saudis
it's a targeting uh mechanism that's
right she's there to to
plant targeting devices yeah everyone
everyone she shakes her butt at
he's got to go we need to consider the
possibility that each person that
this woman is undulating towards elana
omar is actually signaling to a saudi
death squad
that they should be beheaded and to not
consider that possibilities a thought
experiment would be politically correct
and irresponsible
we need to really consider the question
whether muslims are compatible with
democracy we need to be really serious
about this
um
