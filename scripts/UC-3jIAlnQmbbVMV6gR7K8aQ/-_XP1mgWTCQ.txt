all that and more on today's
majority report uh folks
i really want i mean it is
so important to get
really basic and really
basic humanity stuff team human
non-human
when it comes to these immigration cases
there's any number of policy debates
about immigration obviously i
am on the very much left of immigration
by which i mean
everybody that lives here now and has
lived here should be immediately granted
status citizenship period crossing the
border
should not be a criminal offense should
be if anything a
minor civil one should be totally
decriminalized
the united states as well as by the way
the europeans should follow
all international law that they have
signed up to
on refugees and more broadly
we need to address the security state
and climate policies that are driving
so much accelerated migration across the
world they're still going to be borders
um and in fact many countries uh as of
now and in fact many countries
um on the receiving end of as an example
u.s foreign policy
are quite interested in how to have a
open
uh fluid relationship with the rest of
the world in terms of travel trade
commerce and exchange
um but they actually would like their
sovereignty to be respected
by his u.s foreign policy as an example
so i say this because these debates can
get very abstract and very
very quickly in ways that really have
nothing to do
with the debates that are taking place
and the urgent
response to what is happening from this
administration and from ice
right now uh this is
again if you think that this is
acceptable if you support that raid that
is putting children
in shelters or relying on children
strangers for food and clothing whatever
else
that really is i mean i this is a deeper
version i don't mean like this shouldn't
be partisan
it is clearly partisan and in fact maybe
it should have been more partisan
because democratic leaders helped set
the stage for this
uh through their own policy sets but
this is
human or not if you
support this you are not a fully paid-up
member of the human race
and i wanted to highlight and again
that is not every single policy issue
that you could have about immigration
that one is to be really clear and this
one also is
this story i mean i'm sorry i
i actually have some hesitation about
sometimes sharing stories that are just
absolutely you know depressing frankly
uh i i i actually think there's some job
that we have here to engender
a little bit of a sense of hope and
possibility even as we cover all this
stuff
this story is just horrific just awful
it's just a documentation of
the human cruelty of the trump
administration and ice
an iraqi man who was born in greece
came to the united states as a child and
was apparently never
properly documented six months old
i don't know sneaky yeah very sneaky
grew up here worked never caused any
problems
nothing he was deported
to iraq the man is an american he
doesn't speak
arabic i don't think he'd ever even been
to iraq before let alone live there
well this man died because he wasn't
able to access
insulin for his diabetes
this is just pure
pure raw uncut human cruelty
and again anybody who would defend this
is not
human i want to make because again i
keep wanting to make that distinction
you might
hear some people say well i got a
different idea about borders than you
alright
i have some different thoughts about x y
and z and again i i am of the school
that the left
in general needs to be able to
argue effectively hear different
viewpoints and so on
not because of persuasion but frankly
because of how the project is branded
but this stuff is outside of the
bounds of human again
these policies what whatever ice person
did this has a death on their hands
the trump administration has a death on
their chain of command here and
every anybody who touched this should be
exposed
personally and you know being i mean
facing trials for the rest of their life
just
obscene here is a video of this man who
died
what are you doing
two and a half weeks ago speak up please
i was uh
i've been in the united states and six
months old you know
and just two and a half weeks ago uh
immigration agent formerly roberts and
i'm going to iraq
and i i i refused i said i've never been
there i've been in this country my whole
life
you know since pretty much work i
missported by six months
and they refused to listen to me uh
there was an asian kamage
the department of homeland security is
located on 333 mod elite detroit
michigan 48207
agent commands i'm not sure about the
other one if his name is deep or what
his name is
but they just wouldn't listen to me they
wouldn't let me call my family nothing
they just said you go to iraq
and your best bet is to cooperate with
us that way we're not going to send you
off or we'll put you on our commercial
flight
i beg them i said please i've never seen
that country i've never been there
however they forced me i'm here now
and and i don't understand the language
anything i've been sleeping in the
street i'm diabetic i take insulin shots
i've been throwing up throwing up
sleeping in the street trying to find
something to eat
you know i got nothing over here as you
can see i was kicked in the back a
couple days ago claiming to
get off the guys properly i was sleeping
on the ground he claimed it was properly
you know i i begged him i said please
sir i've never seen this country
i i don't understand language you know
nobody speaks english
i i don't i'm sorry i apologize i don't
really know how to
how to move from that
it's evil it's evil
it's evil i shouldn't swear sorry it's
evil
i don't
if you are defending that you're not a
human being
you need to save yourself
you need to access your humanity
and the people who did that that really
is some nazi
i'm following order stuff right there
the level of sociopathy
and cruelty and grotestness of the
policy set
and then the fact that you know those
guys are probably just hitting a quota
getting a thrill getting a kick out of
the fact that
you know whatever distracts them from
their miserable lives they can just go
and just destroy somebody's life go home
to a cigar in hannity
cigar and hannity
it's absolutely disgusting and
uh it's outside it's not human i'll keep
repeating it
there needs to be and and again that
is the stuff that's one of the reasons
also that i really do recommend that you
specify that those rhetorical pushes
can't be used on every single thing
because they are here for certain things
that is nazi stuff that is totalitarian
that is
murderous that should be criminal every
single word you could throw at it
and if there is an ability to prosecute
the people who did this
absolutely i mean
there needs to be we talk about broader
needs for like
historical understandings of this
country across the board and truth and
reconciliation commissions there's gonna
need to be a truth and reconciliation
commission
out of this yes i mean this is just
terrorism directed from the state
and some of it will absolutely be
implicated under you know the obama
administration too
there's no doubt about it the entire
history of the department of homeland
security
which is a short history this is created
in after september 11th there is no
broader institutional memory here
this is a from the outset national
security state boondoggle
that was created to securitize and
surveil the muslim population
infinitely above and beyond the bounds
of the small
and surgical measures you need to take
to protect from actual terrorism
and it's been weaponized now to
terrorize immigrants across the board
and undocumented people and if you think
that your life is safer
because you support a policy that
murdered this guy
then honestly i mean honestly the most
the most compassionate thing i could say
for you
is that you should immediately seek help
and i don't mean that
as as a polemic i mean literally
you should seek help if you
experience actual physical anxiety
because this man was in
your country you need help
you need urgent help not being polemical
not being sarcastic i mean as
joe biden would say literally you need
help
i will also say this if you're maxing
out donations to uh
donald trump uh you need to be exposed
by joaquin castro
100 and if you're the ceo of
soul cycle and you know and and uh in
equinox
and i don't normally go for these things
but i'll tell you what guys uh
cancel those memberships it heard uber
and heard uber and this guy comes out
and he's and he basically tries
you know i'm summarizing but essentially
no we're doing a hamptons fundraiser for
trump because i'm a greedy sob
not because i'm a bigot i mean
and of course frankly being a greedy sob
leads to the same results as what we saw
with this man in this
indirect ways whereas if you are
starving the state to give yourself more
handouts and money
that's killing people so it's the same
thing but
i don't know that just really maybe we
shouldn't start it that way because it's
very hard for me to move from that
i i i'm sorry but it that is one
that must be told it's like those
stories share that story guys
there's clips when you see a police
officer murder you know it's like
some of these things you know you
people need to see them they need to be
real about this this this is what gets
abstracted
you and oh it's about there's a border
and what we need is a common sense
approach i mean
when you know this is
this is what is missing here
again in a very specific conversation
about these ice policies and this
approach which
really frankly i mean just again to put
it in real terms
george w bush's immigration proposal
which was totally business friendly
had all sorts of onerous demands on
people to document citizenship
and was not a justice oriented bill
and he did do a lot of very militant
moves at the border
this would not happen under that
immigration deal wouldn't happen
so you need to be very specific about
the set
of policies that you're supporting here
okay you know what sometimes
transitions are just transitions and
they're overrated i know i'm going to

all right folks we're going to take a

bronco
marich
welcome back to the majority report
michael brooks here joining us now is
bronco
march ateech he is a contributing writer
at the jacobin magazine bronco thanks so
much for doing this by the way how did i
do
you did well that was uh perfect maybe
the best of anyone who's ever introduced
me
that is unbelievable now i'm just
buttering you up but
i think no no i i know and i'm gonna
take it i'm not gonna hear any of your
irony i think everybody i don't want any
i don't want any tough questioning you
know so i have to sort of lead with the
the high praise i'll be trumpian i was
like everybody heard what he said
it was the best introduction everybody
loved it
everybody agreed and by the way he's a
great guy
um so uh bronco
besides i mean what made you
you have this great piece why the wright
hates ilan omar
and you know stipulate that there's the
obvious reasons
she's muslim she wears a scarf
she's african she's a woman right and of
course not all people on the right but
obviously a lot of people on the right
uh have bigotries and fixations about
these things
but what's the bigger reason or maybe
not the bigger reason the other reason
the uh
the under examined reason of why they
find her to be such a threat
yeah well uh omar kind of alluded to
this in that new york times op-ed she
wrote
shortly after the the you know uh sin
send them back controversy where
uh she basically talked about how racism
through american history has been used
to
divide uh people who otherwise have a
lot of stuff in common
um you know share class interests but
it's been used to
divide them and to make them feel like
they you know
they can't partner uh with people just
because they have
you know they happen to be of a
different race or gender or whatever you
know
what have you uh and you know omar's
career has really shown
um and i think you know this is
something that she self-consciously kind
of
really um uh uh tries to
to to embody um that
you can bring people together under a
common
political project who
you know maybe have different
backgrounds who
maybe are different in certain you know
aspects of their identities
but ultimately share a lot of things in
common and omar
throughout her career has kind of built
these uh coalitions of
voters and supporters um with a
combination of you know
kind of universalist programs like
canceling student debt or uh the
national
bill of rights for renters for example
so things that really cut across
uh all these different sort of aspects
race gender and that kind of thing
um but also you know specific uh social
justice oriented stuff
so you know trying to make minnesota a
uh a sanctuary state for instance
or um you know trying to prevent
uh local police from getting their hands
on you know
insane military equipment that kind of
thing so
omar really obviously as you said uh
she's gonna
piss off a lot of uh racist people uh
just by the fact of who she is but she's
also a direct threat to the way that the
right tries to use racism
to divide working-class people so they
can basically just keep working for
uh the one percent for lack of a better
term well i quote her
quote you quoting her throughout our
history racist language has been used to
turn americans against america
american against america in order to
benefit the wealthy elite
she wrote back to her if working
americans are too busy fighting with one
another we'll never address the very
real and very deep
problems our country faces
and so that's i mean that's exactly
right
and it's also interesting because you
know
again in terms of like sanctuary cities
in terms of
serious substantive work on civil rights
issues which i i think is a very
to me i like that framework her record
will go up against anybody's right i
mean as an example she voted against the
ice funding bill i mean that's a that's
a very basic vote
on whether you are you know battling
uh these these these terrorist
immigration policies right
and at the same time though she's not um
you know migrating into like the most
toxic version of like the neoliberal
pseudo-awoke discourse where
you are you know you're you're getting
like you know another version of like
well
okay we'll cancel student debt but it's
only going to be for certain people
and there's all these different
benchmarks that have to be met
um and we're actually creating like more
division and bifurcation
not as toxic or as dangerous obviously
but nonetheless
still not just having a broad and doubt
base where every single human being
needs health care as an example yeah
absolutely and you know this isn't in
the in the piece but uh
omar has really kind of subtly
uh tried to kind of fight against those
really reductive
uh approaches to i guess looking at
politics
um in her when she won a seat in the
in the minnesota house he was actually
in a three-way race between uh
one one person was a 44-year incumbent
uh she was a woman um i believe one of
the first women
uh to get into the minnesota legislature
but
uh don't quote me on that but you know i
think she was kind of a pioneer for her
time
uh and she was also facing up against a
uh somali-american man
and people at the time could have noted
that she had this historic
uh appeal i guess that she she kind of
was a
one she was she was sort of several
firsts rolled into one right because she
was a refugee she was a muslim she was a
woman
um but uh and omar said you know uh
yeah you know sure i am going up against
a somali american man but i'm also
going up against a woman and i'm a woman
you know we have to look beyond just
our identities and take the conversation
beyond that and as another example
uh after she was elected she faced some
racist abuse from a taxi driver um that
was taking her
somewhere i can't remember where now um
and
uh she actually uh refused to press
charges and she basically said you know
we can't we're not gonna
be able to criminalize hate we can't we
can't get rid of hate by criminalizing
it we have to take other approaches so i
think
she she very much i think uh based on
those kinds of statements really
understands that point that you're
making what is her district like that
she represents in the house of
representatives
right so there's this idea that because
she is a
uh somali american refugee a former
refugee
uh her appeal must it must be
you know rooted in sort of uh
purely kind of like uh i guess ethnic uh
chauvinism i guess for lack of a better
term um
and uh i actually actually got some
racist uh
hate mail after writing this you know
somebody said basically oh yeah the only
reason she's there is because
that that somali community voted her in
uh if you look at the district
it's yeah not true at all the district
is i believe two-thirds white i mean
it's the most diverse district in
minnesota
but it's still mostly white yeah exactly
yeah it's you know yeah as some people
say it's like being the slottiest nun
so i mean uh yeah the idea that
that she's only there because she
appeals to sort of
uh you know one narrow constituency is
just completely wrong
and so she actually got compared to ken
martin the democratic farm labor
chairman
said that she reminded him of paul
wellstone's 1990 campaign for the senate
and that was
i mean like the paul wellstone i i don't
know as much about him as i should and
you know he doesn't necessarily get
talked about
as much and and you know if he was a
senator today
in the kind of ascendant environment i
mean i he'd certainly be on the left he
might not necessarily be
as um you know it would have been
actually really interesting to see where
he would have gone
i think you know always to his credit
right before he died in a plane crash in
2002 he did
vote against the invasion of iraq when
he was facing re-election which as
in demented as it sounds was considered
to be a pretty
politically brave thing to do at the
time um but he ran for senate in 1990
as a college professor community
organizer who had supported uh and
worked in jesse jackson's campaigns had
no
big donor base and again in 1990
was running as like a midwestern left
populist so there's a lot of credit
where credit's due in that race
and could you just maybe talk a little
bit more about that very interesting
comparison because it is a real
minnesota thing to draw the
the paul wellstone elon omar connection
yeah well i think uh the first thing is
that both uh wellstone and omar and and
you know countless examples that we can
uh pick throughout history uh really
kind of gives the lie to this idea
that's advanced by people like uh amy
klobuchar and
uh a bunch of other commentators which
i'm sure we've all heard these arguments
that
that uh can the left-wing ideas don't
play
well in the midwest uh that you know you
it's more about incremental small
reforms about moderation
uh uh clearly that is not the case i
mean
wellstone as you point out was
considered this
this stall stalwart liberal uh
you know a liberal lion throughout the
time that he was in congress
uh until he died um obviously omar
herself
uh who is significantly uh to the left
of someone like
amy klobuchar she's managed to uh
get multiple victories uh in the state
um and you know you have a history of
socialists winning power in
states like wisconsin and minnesota um
they're often at the local level but i
think sometimes even
even uh higher offices so yeah i mean um
i think part of the the comparison to
wellstone as well was with the nature of
her campaign
um she from all reports really
uh just dove into the campaign
uh she she knocked on just countless
doors she was
somebody called her you know relentless
uh because she
just never stopped complaining she was
just always talking to people
and um there was one political operative
who
had predicted that you know the max
turnout that they could have gotten was
something like
5 500 people for that um state race
uh and in the end they actually ended up
turning out uh a slightly
larger number than that so i think it
was something like five thousand eight
hundred and
sixty-eight or something a lot of
designs um so you know
very much a similar approach to what uh
stan is what bernie sanders is doing
um on the national level trying to
not just appeal to to voters who are
gonna get out on the day
anyway and and uh you know cast their
vote but actually appealing to people
who
otherwise might not bother and and uh
who have checked out of the political
process particularly at the local level
um part of her outreach was was uh
actually appealing to the
the local university population as well
um so
that's i think sort of where the
wellstone comparison comes from
in in terms of an actual proper
you know real solidarity right like
we've already documented that
illan omar has a very sophisticated
understanding of how the use of race and
racism
has been used you know to divide and
subjugate the working class and then the
racial
hierarchies within that she's
totally unafraid on issues of
immigration
rights across the board and then she had
this really ambitious
great policy set cancelling student debt
medicare for all all of the things that
we need to do
in this sort of broader social
democratic sense
but one thing that's left out of a fair
amount of conversations and i actually
think you know it's very much the
bernie's credit i think bernie's
actually been doing some really
significant things on foreign policy i
think it's
credit i mean again he's the only
candidate for calling to free lula as an
example
that's a major issue um
but she has been absolutely unafraid to
oppose
regime changes attempts in venezuela she
had that
incredible exchange where she revealed
that just you know grotesque eliot
abrams
talk about how the foreign policy
dimension fits in
yeah i mean is it any wonder when you
when you think back to some of that
stuff why this woman pisses the write
off so much
i mean that grilling of elliott abrams i
mean i think
uh most people you know hadn't seen
something like that in u.s politics for
a very long time if uh well yeah i mean
i i
you know i can't remember uh something
similar happening um
you know in recent years i mean she
really she didn't just uh
unquestioningly kind of challenge him on
his record of war crimes and and really
kind of
point out what a what a an awful awful
man he is
but um at the same time challenge these
uh these long-established kind of
precepts of
uh foreign policy in the u.s and um
and also kind of broke the silence this
you know the idea
of civility that you know you you're not
meant to tell
a guy who's a war criminal that he's a
war criminal that's that's uncouth
um but you know beyond that uh and and
you know also i would say at the at the
state level when she was in the in the
state house
she had um had sponsored a a provision
that was
going to ban military aid to honduras
for example which
obviously has been mired in sort of all
manner of chaos after the 2009
uh obama-backed coup there right uh but
but the other part of it is as well
is that you know the whole idea behind
the
uh the hate towards her and the kind of
smears that i launched against is that
um yeah okay first the claim is that
she's
an anti-semite but also it's this idea
that she's kind of this
this alien force this uh you know that's
kind of a
basically a foreign terrorist she's kind
of working at the behest of some shadowy
international
movement of muslims um and the hilarious
thing about that
is that uh i mean like
basically it's the trump administration
that is really the one that's beholden
to a foreign power
um when when omar got elected omar and
rasheed
and and others um al-arabiya the uh the
saudi
uh owned state newspaper published a
piece basically calling umar and ty
uh you know muslim infiltrators which i
mean you know
this is coming from a a muslim country a
muslim theocracy in fact or a very
repressive one
um but they were they were accusing her
of
you know being this sort of infiltrator
and of course as we know
over the past few years forget
russiagate i mean
trump has been far more differential
and and servile to saudi arabia in power
to the point where i mean you know
you've got saudi officials
spending time you know just throwing
money at his hotel
um i mean rex tillerson the former
secretary of state was
was basically fired from from what
what reports say because of his
opposition to um
to saudi arabia's conflict with qatar
um and i mean you could go example after
example
um and of course isn't unique to trump i
mean
president's success of presidents
including obama
bush they were all very uh
bush notoriously so they were all very
uh sort of
um uh deferential to saudi arabia
um i mean deferential is that's that
word is not even accurate to really
describe how uh
how nicely and and favorably they
treated that country
right and and i think yeah i mean
whatever one thinks of of the russia
stuff one way or another it always
struck me though it's just so comedic
that like like stipulate
that there was some type of grand
conspiracy
you know in the real like jonathan
shaite fever dream variety
and so like and the russians started
setting this up in the 80s
and they did all these deals and all
this stuff and then the saudis are just
like
like you guys are idiots like you just
you just fly him out you put his face on
a billboard
you give him a sword and you say he's
awesome
and then like maybe backdoor some hotel
deals like why do you make it so
complicated
give him a cool cool looking orb right
he put his hands
on to pretend like he's saruman or
something it's not that hard
it just you you say he's great and then
there's an
orb you guys are morons like why do you
complicate the simple
yeah clearly clearly russia has a lot to
learn uh when it comes to uh
foreign influence from saudi arabia i
mean you know and saudi arabia's
influences out in the open they're
spending just right uh
millions of dollars a year on lobbying
um you know they
they have literally lobbyists work for
the newspapers of record that
you know including the washington post
that uh
that that you know who's whose uh
tagline was changed the democracy dies
in darkness i mean they
they they had uh the turkish obvious
sorry bad joke apologies oh yeah right
no no
all right yeah it's upset do you find
actually
pivoting off of this for a minute i mean
do you think that that's a really
powerful reframe of being able to speak
honestly about the israeli occupation as
an example that
every time they tried this move on to
lib or omar
they're more willing than almost anybody
else in congress to speak honestly about
the gulf states too
i mean how effective it would be as a as
as a full messaging
i i can't say but i think it's an
important thing to
to point out that i mean you know the
the attacks against omar
um and maybe if i look back on this i'd
be incorrect but but from memory the
attacks against omar the really
concerted focus on her began when
she did that grilling of elliott abrams
um so i mean
i think it is clear that the the way
that
these new uh congresswoman are
challenging
uh power and and you know some of the
most
basic uh core elements of uh
of of thinking in washington and and
sort of these assumptions that that
everyone for for decades has taken
is grounded as uh you know as being
definitively right
i think that is a big part of it i mean
you know uh you just
you did not really hear the same sort of
criticism particularly of israel i mean
that's that's really new this sort of
very
uh harsh unflinching criticism of israel
israel's policies uh towards the
palestinians it it was
really kind of invisible from the uh
from from congress
uh before these uh these congresswoman
came in
so i think that is a big part i think
it's always worth
pointing out to people uh the ulterior
motives that
that sit at the heart of um of attacks
on on left-wing uh political figures uh
whether they're in congress or whether
they're just activists
so you made the point looping back to
the beginning i mean
that that obviously white supremacists
fear and hate her because she
just in her existence is a threat
to their horrific you know their
grotesque vision of society
and in that respect it's not terribly
different than why they hated barack
obama so much even though barack obama
was
you know a center-right democrat uh
totally different politics than elon
o'mar
but you say the right more generally
recognizes that she's a more
potent threat to all of the orders that
they hold dear
including most especially the economic
ones
yeah i mean you know the wright hated
obama because he was a black man
but what did he actually do he bailed
the banks he didn't prosecute anyone on
wall street
he ramped up the drone program
uh way beyond what bush had done um
you know really expanded the war on
terror uh killed a lot of muslims
um in some cases american citizens
without any due process or anything i
mean this is just a short list obviously
we could we could spend days going
through the the failures and
and terrible things that the obama
administration did
but yeah ultimately the hatred of obama
by the right was
was partly completely irrational and
partly a strategy
that by by never giving in uh and never
giving him really
any sort of kudos or victory uh
it was a way to drag him and push him
further right which worked
um with omar however you know it's not
just the fact that
they they hate her because of who she is
uh unlike obama she really is someone
who
is uh using her position to challenge
uh power uh particularly the sort of
some of the the warped kind of world
view that exists
in in washington dc um so she is she's a
much bigger threat i mean
you know uh in many ways she's
uh you know uh kind of
all the all the terrible ugly
stereotypes and conspiracies i had about
obama um that they feared that you know
he was gonna
uh you know change america's foreign
policy and that kind of thing
um that's a lot more accurate about omar
obviously not the really racist stuff
but you know just the the stuff about
fundamentally reshaping
uh how washington works obama was never
going to do that but
but omar really is so i mean i can only
imagine that kind of
how people are being driven crazy right
now uh how these right-wingers are being
driven crazy right and and at the same
time
still a actual powerful advocate for
for a pluralistic democracy while this
you know
ultraxenophobic anti-muslim
administration
is also hand in glove with the most
repressive theocracy on the planet that
in fact has
materially funded the ideology
uh you know that gets specifically
centered on groups that commit
actual terrorism which are obviously a
very small amount of muslims so like
the just kind of disgusting ironies
abound here
um and so you know i mean last i
i think obviously i mean we all support
her we're all incredibly struck by
her bravery and her vision and you do
you think like
the last thing i'd like you to touch on
too is that it strikes to me that for
all of
like her her great politics
uh the her identity all of these things
that the other part of what makes her so
effective is actually that
like you know like a bernie sanders or
any number of other
really good political leaders she's very
plain spoken
and actually keeps it really simple and
direct
that is a key to uh political
communication i think
that the stuff like the west wing
um not not only the west wing but that
was a big part of why
uh liberal technocrats kind of kind of
took this very high-minded style
uh and and have an aversion to populism
uh where someone like omar you're right
and and sanders they
put ideas that people haven't
necessarily been exposed to before they
put them
in terms that that those people can
really
understand that's not saying that you
know people are dumb or anything it's
just you know if you're not familiar
with with ideas i mean we saw that with
the joe rogan
interview with sanders recently where uh
all these people you know you look in
the comments and you look in
the posts and on subreddits about the
video and these people say you know
i i've only sort of gone the sound bites
of sanders now i
now i hear him actually talking and i
realize he's actually not that radical
and that he has a lot of good ideas
um and i think that is important i you
know for
a lot of people uh you know sorry to
talk about santa's again but a lot of
people
um uh kind of objected to or thought his
speech and democratic socialism where he
he basically said it was the unfinished
business of the the new deal
people had a variety of criticisms about
that some people said that
uh on the one hand he shouldn't be
leaning into democratic socialism that's
a bad idea
uh after speech other people said well
it's ridiculous to say that um
socialism is just the just just sort of
taking the new deal a little bit further
it's it's not although you know
the same people saying that wouldn't
even
want to do anything nearly as ambitious
as a new deal so that's always important
to remember
right but the key there is that that
sanders by invoking fdi and the new deal
and and couching his view of the world
his vision for
the country in in that history
he is using terms of reference um
that ordinary americans understand you
know i mean
people probably don't know that much
about fdi new deal
but that and you know not that that was
a especially radical uh
uh thing that fdr did i mean ultimately
you know he
he did this to save capitalism however
nonetheless it was still
a program a wide-ranging program that
transformed many people's lives that
put the government front and center in
people's lives in a way that that hadn't
really been done ever before
um and really shifted people's thinking
and it just and and you know
more to the point perhaps pissed off a
lot of rich and powerful people who
even though roosevelt wanted to want to
maintain um
maintain capitalism and save it i mean
you know
these guys were ready to to do a coup
they they were planning to
get him out of office uh so i think um
yeah i mean i think omar and and sanders
i think both of their
uh successes um in electoral politics
are i think a good role model for people
um you know in the future uh whether
politicians are activists and
you know how how do you bring people
over to your side you know and
and as you say using direct
language that that is rooted in the
experience of
of the constituents you're trying to win
over i think is a key
uh bronco uh mark march a teach
best pronunciation ever ever
top five for sure welch
all right that gets a little trickier
when we're talking about the world of
podcasts getting into the top
five that that that could be that was
very sneaky bronco that could be really
either
very good or very bad the pieces well
the interview is over
i i downgraded now you can mess around
uh see that's now you're doing trump
i make deals it's like you know why i'm
smart
i praise upfront i condemn after because
i'm smart
um why the wright hates elon omar
great essay in the jackman you can read
all the broncos really smart
essays in the jackman bronco thanks so
much for doing this
hey thanks for having me on thanks all
right folks
uh we gotta get to the fun half i will
say
um yeah we're not gonna go very long on
this fun half on my next thursday every
i always have to reset next thursday
we'll we'll go to what i guess is our
new normal
time event when i started on this show
we could end at about 1 45
2 o'clock was normal to slightly pushing
it and if it went to 210 or 215 it was
like that was a long show
that's about when i started too that was
even when you started right
yeah i mean 145 was already done when
you started yeah no i don't remember
i think 145 i mean that wasn't two
o'clock it was
we're about done now it's like
i mean now what's crazy is i feel like
we're inching towards three
basically yeah right and
i mainly write past two yeah we
apothecally steamrolled past two so

majority
matt what's going on lindarary hangover
uh literary hangover uh people should
check out my
first uh episode on james van impe
cooper's the pioneers because that is a
very interesting novel
um where uh it's james from our cooper
sort of
mythologizing his father's landlord ways
of how
you know this country's founded by
basically financial interests it's not
pioneers like
the money like we're going to need to
commodify something before we let people
settle
these lands that's basically how
american uh settlement has worked
and uh and cooper like he he omits
certain things like there's not yearly
elections which were a big part of his
dad's life and big aggravation for him
um so he depoliticizes it in that way
but a lot of these sort of economic
elements of it are
extremely interesting there's
overfishing of rivers
there's um actually when when
white settlers first came to america
there were huge flocks of just millions
of birds
and the new settlers you should just
like shoot cannons and stuff into it
just
just birds would just like walk on the
ground just because like
there's a bunch of them just like i i've
actually read similar accounts of uh
chinese uh soldiers doing really similar
things in tibet
yeah tibet's ecology and wildlife it's a
giant flock of birds it's like a big
dragon you just settler colonialism
settler colonialism
i mean people were going off back then
with the with exploiting the land and
just
and like chopping down trees because you
burn a maple tree you get a bunch of
potassium
um and that was good fertilizer because
there's a lot of droughts in europe
anyway
all this is in this book so it's really
good for patrons on saturday

um and erica i it's one of his
uh it's a very eloquent um anti-colonial
uh writing it's about his time as an
imperial policeman in
in burma and it's it talks about putting
people to death so it's also one of the
most
eloquent anti-capital punishment essays
that i can think of anyway

hey hey shut up thank you for calling
into the majority report
sam will be with you shortly welcome
back
we are in the fun half michael brooks
here
this is of course the majority report um
i
am should be opened um just to let folks
know in case you're not i don't see
any ims besides the spam and i know
people are very uh
they go where's the ims there are days
where
everything i hear is just the same voice
ask the moms why are the iambs open
although i am something do you see all
right let's take one call out of the
gate
you're calling from a 512 area code who
are you where are you calling from
hi is this me yeah this is you
hey this is uh marco calling from austin
texas
oh hey marco from austin how are you hey
yes
fine thank you how are you thank you for
taking nicole uh my pleasure
i am from mexico city okay uh so first
uh
like i want to take an obvious topic out
of the
out of the list so i haven't noticed any
uh
differences on the on the mexican
community
here and i haven't noticed any uh
invective against me but i guess that's
because i'm a
white passing mexican which does change
a lot of things until i open my mouth
but uh but i do i i mean i i
like the the uh i mean
the uh the the um
the atmosphere is is not good against
mexicans right now and i
i i i i'm not still a big fan of uh
what uh joaquin castro these because
yes letting who's
donating to trump yeah yeah that's right
but that's not uh and actually it's
great i like god i'm
i'm very happy that i got to speak to
you because my question actually has to
do with
foreign politics do you know how in
mexico we uh
recently elected a left-wing president
recently like last year yep and
he's and he has been less than
good lesson he hasn't been good at all
like he's been uh
bowing to trump uh and on immigration
which i think it's it's
despicable and uh
pretty much the same and when you say
less than and
uh yeah i mean i've heard so i just want
to say
i i the reason i haven't covered his
heart is i just i've covered a little
bit on tnbs but there's a lot more that
i need to
to sort of get into i'd like to
i think maybe we'll have kristen
thornton on uh who's a great
uh scholar and observer of this stuff
but
when you sit so well actually i mean
just make me make your question i just
want to say
not to defend oprah door but i do know
that he's done
some reforms in terms of wages and labor
issues and i also think that
as far as confronting the trump
administration
[Music]
you know people shouldn't be naive about
how significant a challenge it is for
mexico to frankly
challenge any u.s administration in a
substantive way i do just want to kind
of put that on the table but
we but i hear you that i mean yes in
many ways clearly at least from my
observation
there's been a lot of frustrations and
disappointments and i don't know what
did
i don't know the extent to which it is
the failings and problems with the oprah
door political project
which it could be or the reality that
left-wing governance
in a place that is still
primarily dominated by a hegemon uh
is is really hard but anyways what's
your question
so yeah so uh so basically uh like
having some discussion with with friends
and and like
and the thing is i've been a fan of uh
lopez obrador for for all of my
adults life yeah and uh but but
yeah like i mean i've been a great fan
and i i was hoping for him to be
the mexican lula and like which i'm
not sure if it will happen but so how do
you think i should
convince people like if the lopes of
another government turns out to be bad
like how do you think i should convince
people that
that's just him and i guess you have
partially
answered this question that i i how do i
convince people not to lose
uh hope on the on the leftist project
and
because i mean i i do think that the
leftist project would be great for
mexico and we
do need to relate to uh regard the
neoliberalism that we've had in the last
decade
but how do i convince people if the
alvaro
government is a bit of a doubt of uh
failure
i don't know i mean i think that that
will
i mean i think there's some
self-revelation right i mean
if it is it is and i think that there's
um
[Music]
i mean it's a fine line because i just
think
dismissing electoral politics um
in in in our day and age is just so
you know it's just naive but
you know there's obviously a lot of
other left forces in mexico that
even if they're aligned with upper door
they might not be aligned with him right
i mean there's groups like the
zapatistas there's other you know forces
that stand in and outside of electoral
politics
pushing for the project that mexico and
the world needs and
that is what i have so far um but i
promise
i i'll look for a better answer i
promise more mexican coverage
from me i need to dive into it more and
i appreciate the call man
thank you no man that's
yeah that is a there is some stuff
riding on oprah door
so i hope that that is
not a a bummer
uh as it were you're calling from a 917
area code who are you where you're
calling from
hey michael this is uh here's a water
boat from kashmir
hey how are you doing good to hear from
you what's on your mind uh
um yeah actually i wasn't planning on
calling it
it's hard to talk but i figured i should
um
well uh you know this is kind of
um but um you know you uh
what is the name um
yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry um no
problem uh yeah he did go through the
general overview
but i did this just for people so they
know that was on the michael brooks show
youtube channel because there's some
people who won't know what you're
referring to i did a
cashmere special with interest with the
intercept reporter
murtaza hussein anyways please go ahead
tell us yeah oh yeah um
no he uh everybody should check it out
if they have
no idea what's going on because those
are very good um and
sorry but kind of like a general
overview sure because
they're so much to unwrap uh that
honestly
it would be it would take like multiple
shows um
and unfortunately the way things are
going
uh over the next few months you may not
have any choice but to do multiple shows
as things are kind of getting worse
um so for now all i just want to say
is uh like
the the amount of alphabet
uh do you mind what i'm sorry apathy
okay i don't know yeah no i understand i
just missed that
apathy yeah yeah uh from
generally speaking the international
community in the press right now
is uh and i don't think it's malicious i
think it's just
no one really talks about that region
because there's other things to talk
about that region
it is uh kind of heart-wrenching
um but that's sort of leading to a
problem now where
if there isn't enough um
at least uh voices from outside saying
what the is going on pardon my
french
then the kashmiris i mean they already
are sort of
are going to start looking in words
for um solutions
and for that matter pakistan by
extension which means
uh lots of uh
well violence uh i myself grew up
in um uh kashmir that would be uh the
pakistani side of kashmir but
what um i mean what people
don't realize that there was a kashmir
before 1947
like before the partition so i have to
tell people
explain to people briefly what the
partition was and then
and then tell us that sure uh so
um the south asia was part of the uh
british empire
and as the british empire was crumbling
all around the world
this was also the place it really left
because mostly
uh due to non-violent movement by uh
also known as mahatma gandhi uh but at
the end
uh the hindu fundamentalists kind of uh
went nuts
and so they wanted to create a
two states along communal lines one for
muslims and one for well majority of
hindus but
literally everyone else uh and so the
british partitioned
india on the way out
now kashmir's specific issue wasn't
resolved because it was
a quasi-independent state
when the british left um and it was
under
uh it was what they call a princely
state
uh for about a hundred years before the
partition
and this is where the problems i'm not
going to go in detail just from the next
10 seconds explaining
for about three to four decades before
partition
like before 1947 before there was in
india and pakistan in their modern form
there was a feudal rebellion in the
state of kashmir that includes both the
indian side and the pakistani side
which no one talks about because that
has huge implications
on what happened um you know in terms of
the modern conflict
uh because i mean it was almost medieval
uh the rule not almost and almost
exactly was like my own family
uh if you go back uh i guess three
and a half almost four generations two
of my uh
ancestors were skinned alive i mean
this was like normal uh the only quote
that comes to my mind right now
is the british voice roy to india when
he visited kashmir this was
i think in the 1930s said
that the lower caste hindus
or even like the middle caste for that
matter were treated like dogs
and the muslims are treated worse the
majority of the population was
well muslim so i mean outside this
context
i mean that's why i've spoken to i don't
know dozens
of uh i have a lot of indian friends
here because you know new york is a
melting pot
uh and with the exception of a couple of
them they kind of got these glassy eyes
when i asked them like
what was going on right before 1947.
because it's like a black hole of
information
right no one has id that and and i had
the same exact
experience with like my soldier friends
you know there were kind of students
studying here
i was like hey so what was happening in
saudi arabia in 1923 they have no idea
because it didn't exist
right i mean that part of history is
like erased or not taught
so well i i mean there's a lot of
unravel i want to go into that
uh because it'll take the next two hours
we'll all say right now
yeah please go ahead it's uh please uh
it's very important that people are at
least paying attention
and let's just be careful when we make
like hand wave arguments of like oh it's
a conflict between india and pakistan
and foxes on militancy krishna
because that completely fogs up the
situation on the ground
and well currently the pakistani
government is incredibly incompetent
which is why kashmiris are getting
really really pissed and they're looking
for the pakistani military
for signals uh and uh
and they are giving signals i mean
they're making statements now
um
that is very disturbing i mean yesterday
in
guardian's front page uh two separate
articles
had quotes from the pakistani army chief
not the government that's because they
had no strategy
right um and one thing that people
don't open with this uh something that
people don't know
is yeah they're about five million
kashmiris or four and a half million on
the boxes money side
and we've all like have a very deep
connection to both sides of kashmir
and uh historically uh kashmiris are
made up a large portion of
the pakistani army and even though they
represent around
four percent of the total population of
pakistan
they make up over one-third of the
pakistani army which has huge
um structural implications within the
military and pakistan
so kashmir is like a very touchy issue
i don't know how it doesn't lead to
conflict
if people don't put pressure and the
only thing
that within india people are responding
to
at least for the congress is when
there's pressure from
outside uh and yeah
uh i i don't know yeah um
it's yeah you've got some volumes on
this but sorry well i'm gonna do a
segment i'll actually i'll
i'll move from this we did have a little
bit of a package planned on it so we'll
do that now
um thanks so much for the call please
call back soon
hang in there i'm i mean i'm sorry thank
you
of course good luck good luck good luck
so
yeah there's some really important just
kind of brief history to overview on
this
like he was saying the root of this
current iteration is 1947 that there's
first the split of pakistan from india
there's the partition which happens
after decolonization in india
and kashmir's disputed area now
on one hand it has been under heavy
military occupation since at least the
80s
and there has been constant and
well-documented serious abuses by the
indian military
on kashmiri uh civilians and there's
also been uh the uh use of the
uh you know the pakistanis have funded
uh militant groups which have engaged in
terrorism and the pakistanis see it
it's both a question of national pride
for pakistan because of the loss of
bangladesh which goes back to the 70s
the pakistanis
that bangladesh actually used to be part
of pakistan
pakistanis waged the genocidal war there
the indians
supported bangladeshi independence for
their own strategic reasons and so on so
there's a lot of history here and of
course the broader context is that these
are two nuclear armed states
who've already fought three wars and
there's a lot of tension there's a small
amount of kashmir which is under
pakistani control
but what neru did do and has
held mostly even for all of the abuses
is is basically regional autonomy so
that outside of an independent kashmiri
foreign policy
there can be a lot of rule setting
inside kashmir so
one of the things that this does i mean
this revokes and changes the
constitution so it is part of a broader
effort of the bjp to destroy pluralism
in india
not necessarily secularism i don't know
that necessarily you could call india a
secular state but it really did have a
degree of significant pluralism
under the old congress party tradition
that was a huge achievement
so they're trying to destroy that with
their own
version of nationalism and imagined past
and so on and we already know modi's
record
look at his conduct during the mass
murders in gujarat
in 2002 i mean this is a horrific
record of this guy that has been
whitewashed
through right-wing forces through you
know people that just want to carry on
true
you know the diplomatic and political
activity of of the united states of
india barack obama
co-wrote a column with narendra modi
this was a guy who back
several years ago was not allowed to
enter the united states
because of his possible complicity in
genocidal atrocities in gujarat
so this move is about destroying indian
pluralism and then it's also about the
fact that kashmir
is beautiful it has a huge amount of it
it has a
enormous potential for tourism and so if
you
basically allow it to lose its autonomy
there can be a rush and there's an
analogy to a china and tibet situation
where the local population or
puerto rico even local population can be
uprooted
and there can be basically a primitive
capitalist accumulation process as well
which is the perfect distillation
of the bjp hindu nationalist politics
there's a report that we have from al
jazeera on the ground
and we'll just play some of that just
some of this
sorry it's sound number um
just a little bit of a report just so
you can
that's the kind of historical political
context the extent
i can give some of it uh and this is
some reporting on the ground
of the incredibly aggressive measures
that the indians are taking here in
kashmir let's play a little bit of that
srinagar a ghost town troops on every
corner
barricades everywhere in the largest
city
in the indian administered kashmir
india's government says
recent troop reinforcements are to
ensure security
and to maintain order as kashmiri see
the effects
of the significant changes to their
autonomy
and statehood they didn't tell us
anything and revoked article 370.
all the phone lines are down trains are
not working we haven't seen anything
like this in kashmir in our lives
migrant workers who hope to find
employment here
have been stranded for days
um so there's a sense of it uh
really um serious
i'll make the specific point look of
course tulsi gabbard should be answered
asked about this but every single
presidential candidate should be
this is one of the prime crises in the
world today um
the indians have been extremely
resistant on international mediation on
kashmir and even the acknowledgment of
the abuses that that government has
always untake
undertaken in kashmir and the pakistanis
have
fomented as i say terrorist actions
there as well
um okay uh
seb gorka's business card when talking
about electability i think you're
forgetting an amazing achievement that
amy klobuchar won minnesota as a
democrat
running on the revolutionary platform of
tax advantage savings accounts
amy klobuchar especially i mean that is
true i mean look obviously minnesota
has is home of you know horrifying
bizarre reactionaries like michele
bachmann but
it's also the home of paul wellstone and
ilhan omar
and some really damn fine midwestern
populism so i mean
it's only recently she's useless i don't
get her she should be primaried
yeah i mean yeah i i don't know how to
put her in the lineage of
minnesota progressives it's just that
she's just a reflection i think of
minnesota is going purple it's kind of
scary although it's been shored up i
think
minnesota didn't react well to trump um
but uh like there's parts of that state
that are just very very fascist
right uh literally like i think they're
just like that's how i would describe
them
and then you have the district that
ilhan omar comes from which is like one
of i think the greatest districts in
america just
i mean that people act like it's some
sort of like all somalian district in
minneapolis no like it's like 70 70 or
maybe 60
white like but anyway absolutely doe
you need to add the drug war to biden's
horribles no future for cannabis
legalization
uh dem candidates start listing all the
agencies infrastructure treaties and
social networks that trump has gutted
talk about
mitch packing the courts young could
serve judges for life if the dem wins
the presidency
we will get health care quit pounding on
each other i
don't agree with that uh and this is
i mean yeah i think we should definitely
start to mention the courts we haven't
been doing enough of that
yeah i mean come on yeah i mean look no
but also but i guess the point that i'm
saying is like
like if dems win the presidency we will
get health care quit pounding on each
other like no
no and also you know it's not that's
just that's a
very healthcare naive presupposition and
also i mean look
now is the time for fighting have that
fight
it is the democratic primary this is
what's pissing me off about everybody
talking about okay
i have not heard a single democratic
candidate
attack barack obama no like
people have policy disagreements and
like
i people need to get over especially if
you're listening to this podcast right
like
this is our job is to agitate for this
stuff precisely like
s and if if not now when do we do it you
that comment i'm sorry but that comment
says more about your
um personal like inability to deal with
like the moment than it does
like a strategic approach to dealing
with these issues we need to fight about
this stuff or it doesn't happen
or it doesn't happen and that's hugely
important in the long term i mean look
look i absolutely accept that it is a
national emergency
you must defeat donald trump period
just stop i totally accept that and i
also think
and know that if you don't start dealing
with
the longer term failures of
globalization and other structural
issues which
absolutely include material ones uh
this menace that we're living in that is
a global phenomenon
ain't going away uh this argument needs
to happen
cosmic yawn mike thoughts on your
destiny debate last night general
consensus seems to be you talk too much
ooh
well um let me just say i mean i i think
um
i had really limited time so i realized
in retrospect i should have
i should have had more time to do it
uh i thought some of the conversation
was actually really productive
um point taken if destiny and i talk
again i'll let him
uh speak more uh and
i think some people have a very like
i'm on the merits debater so
there were times where it was like no
there's actually a real basic structural
foundational point here
and it's not being addressed and i don't
want to pivot off into a rabbit hole
and i'm not going to let that happen so
you know i think it's tricky because
i like and respect destiny even though
obviously we have strong disagreements
and
you know whatever uh so i
i thought the first part was more of a
discussion was more productive
um but i'm also somebody who and again i
said this on the show this is not
destiny but i'm somebody who you know
i go on cable sometimes i debate idiots
and
you know part of but part of what you
learn is just in terms of debate tactics
is like sometimes it's like no
conversation is going to stay focused on
what i think are the important grounds
of conversation and
so i'll hopefully talk with him again
let him talk more
i thought part of it was productive i
will say i've seen a lot of people who
actually thought that the information
was actually really important and
interesting and that it went well
and when i see too much whining and
complaining from people
on social media not not destiny but just
like you know people tweeting like
you didn't talk enough that's like okay
that's not a good sign for like if you
don't have anything to say about the
merits and the substance if it's just
sort of
tone whining then i'm very skeptical uh
yeah i think
people need to realize that when they uh
confine themselves to aesthetic
judgments about things that they're not
really saying in anything
at all precisely jay cool hey michael
saw your discussion with destiny
i think you did very well thank you i
think you pointed out how clear destiny
with
uh differences destiny has with leftist
he could not fathom why labor
environmentalists have a role in
crafting trade agreements
yes and i'm not going to relitigate it
because he's not here but yes
absolutely that was not addressed and i
couldn't let it
pivot into like sort of micro stuff
because there was a foundational debate
there
um which was also in fact empirical uh
and i just want i if there's any more of
these do not send them tomorrow
and sam is hosting yeah yeah please
we got it i gave you i found one that
was negative one that was positive
done yeah michael's not going to be here
too and i'm not going to be here
actually you know what
because i'm not going to be here a
button barred sam
asked him what he thought of the destiny
yeah
if you watched it that's going to be
watching it okay
you get a chance to watch michael's the
baby and if he says no
still asking me yeah yeah just like well
dead well he said this and then
characterize it in a very reductive way
yes and then ask him what he thinks
if you if he says he didn't see it then
then give
and by the way give yourself some time
don't rush it give a
full detailed explanation about the
debate when
so yeah so he has all the available
information and sam will make some
noises
as if he doesn't want to hear it but
just bowl right over there yeah just
maybe don't even listen to the receiver
don't pay attention to his frustration
and gathering adjective just just
just just go right into it because and
then tell him to check it out when he
finally says i didn't watch
yeah no and don't tell them to check it
out say
i think you really need to see this
just to understand how important and
urgent it is
oh my god send an email with a link yeah
send an email with a link to it maybe uh
no don't do this no that's it but and if
he doesn't pick up your call for
whatever reason
definitely said i would send a couple of
ims using a couple of different handles
just to make sure that you
because because it's really really
important i mean you know cashmere is
one thing but
there was some debate about the yeah
yeah michael and destiny
bickered on twitch yesterday definitely
[Laughter]
uh well hey hey i i do i'm still on it
though yeah and i did want to debate tpp
so i did
i think it's still important absolutely
super important that sam watches it
and that and then at the very least you
call them and tell them about
it in detail
like don't don't leave any to fill it
because by the way we didn't just talk
about tpp we also talked about health
care
polling expertise i mean there's at
least
three different discrete parts of the
debate you're going to want to overview
each of them and i would ask sam
like not even just generally what he
thought of the debate but what he
thought of each section of the debate
maybe you want to have clips to play
like hold your phone up to a computer
you can hold your
phone up to a speaker that would also be
[Laughter]
and then if you could somehow connect
this to
maybe something that sam thinks about
not 2020 but say
2022. that would really that would tie
it with a bow
oh my god um rest in peace david berm
berman if you haven't seen him yet you
should check out the message he wrote
after disbanding the silver jews
oh he he defoed his own brother his
father for good reason giving him an
ultimatum to either cease his deplorable
business dealings
union busting fast food lobbying or he'd
sever their relationship
yeah r.i.p dave berman real one right
there r.i.p dave berman
um i don't know who are the silver jews
what is that silver jews
was a college band uh from uva
that was the precursor to pavement and
stephen malcomus's band and
very literary kind of 90s indie band
he just released his first album in over
a decade and
tragically died the other day before
going on tour for the first time in over
a decade and his father was a really
awful lobbyist and disowned him uh
once obama was elected got it
that sounds that's sad that's so young
man
jesus retcon do you like when sam gets
into a 45 minute quote unquote debate
with libertarians at 2 35
i do not and tell you most assuredly and
it's quite libertarian of sam because he
really is exercising his
dictatorship of the workplace that we
can't go get a freaking bite of food
because somebody's just like
i have a problem with you
uh uh gun control is common sense the um
neoliberal john should call it
neoliberal judge i've watched that
clip about
and it's been watched about three
thousand times and i think i've watched
those about 50
that's all i did yesterday was watch the
clip of like
that 20 seconds oh my god it's like a
future song
smoke and watch what is it that draws
you
to it what is it like that has such a
special place
there's such a good there's like very
pregnant pause maybe we should just
bring this up
i think that there i think partially
what happens is that
he's so like the libertarians are
maddening and they're crazy but they're
they're like they're in like this
different
trench and john it's like he isn't even
necessarily like
i think i know what happened it is like
the most
minutia of the minutia and it's so
ridiculous but it's like
also kind of good-natured i don't know
what well there's there's people who are
trying to rebrand neoliberal there's a
twitter account that's trying to rebrand
it as if it didn't come from like milton
friedman and those like
you know monsters right like as if it's
just like markets but that's just
liberalism right like it's not
yeah exactly he's a cl it's classical
liberal john but
what i really like about this is the the
the pause
and then i have no this is mean we
shouldn't play this no no okay if i
already
set it up we love look you call you have
content this is all love
this is yeah i mean it's all love from
me at least i don't know about matt yeah
i i love you too john
hi basically anytime there's like a
terrible idea
right so it'll be like for profit
prisons or it'll be
like some acid i'm saying that
libertarian that one counts
for profit is a neo-liberal idea
i wouldn't necessarily agree
right down to my obnoxious yeah
no sorry god
your room stopped swearing you're in the
take oh yeah i know that is tough to do
swearing i would have had that yeah i
mean the problem is
i i normally don't you know like to
dwell on individual
calls because we don't like to scare
people away from conway but i mean the
problem was he just he was just wrong
right
absolutely about the central part of his
identity
and to see i think gears turned in that
way is is very amusing
that's i think that is what it is it's
like libertarians are obviously just
wrong
but they're still like they are like
well i believe in some fantasy principle
and you disagree with this was just like
basketball is a racket sport
i really wish you guys would stop saying
it isn't it yeah
i mean look at pete sampras yeah alex
ambrose doesn't play basketball
i would disagree i would disagree with
that if you look he's using his hands a
lot
it's been looking at his shorts yeah
look at the shorts it's all hand-eye
coordinating he is bouncing the ball
before he serves uh i i don't think you
guys would be fair
so i don't know i think at least in that
small sample size neoliberal calls are
better than libertarian calls
definitely and i'm sure he's got much
better politics oh definitely i think he
probably does
see he want i'm sure i bet he opposes
private prisons but just doesn't want
them called neoliberal whereas like
the libertarian would call and start
with like i think we all agree that
uh prisons are bad and probably like end
the call by saying like
there should be millions of private
prisons that are
run in a paramilitary feudal state
actually i would
invite uh john to uh i i genuinely like
to hear his response to how cornell west
talked about markets in the
rogan interview because i think that he
talked about it in a way that might
upset
certain leftists that are like very
allergic to the
conception of markets at all right and
so i would i'd like your take on that
maybe more than what neoliberalism is
defined as
indeed all right what is uh okay let's
let's do a couple of pieces of sound and
then gotta
talk about an important story in brazil
um
and honduras so
this is what clip number is this
all right so this guy is pretty
unimportant uh relatively speaking so he
doesn't really make the
make the racket um and in some way make
you know make the list look
what tucker carlson is doing is
infinitely more significant
powerful formidable and needs to be
strategically dealt with
um beyond just condemnation of course it
needs to be condemned and called for
what it is the sinister game he's
playing about white supremacy
in my view but there is also
a huge amount of stuff he is doing
um in really generating a different
discourse and right wing
populist discourse which has a real
constituency here and it is not just
race and immigration issues it's a
completely different
way inside conservative politics of
critiquing the market
which has not been very emphasized in
american politics
i mean jordan peterson's project would
be so much less
would be so much more formidable and
less laughable
if when on the other if when look when
he makes all his reactionary statements
about gender
or uh which is totally indefensible
but when he or when he makes his
defensible statements about alienation
and loss of purpose
the fact that he couples that with a
blind defense of the market
is delusional and there have been
historical conservatives
who have had some extremely you know
social views that we would argue against
vehemently and fight
every step of the way because we just
fundamentally disagree on basic civil
rights
for people but they understood that
capitalism disrupted people's lives and
that also included disrupting
institutions that they hold
held dear right like the capitalism
doesn't want you
they don't care about you know modern
tech capitalism does not want you to
have a traditional family structure or
anything like that because they want you
to be able to be a digital nomad and
leave every
four months right so
uh but at the same time there is the
michael savages of the world
who is right on a through line
of the base of the republican party he's
still doing drive time radio
and there's nothing uh you know
formidable about this
this is just a transparent articulation
of the trump
base this is the only country on earth
where mass shootings continue regularly
it doesn't happen anywhere else in the
world and we are asking why here and
what can we do about it
i was very disappointed in the president
attacking white supremacy
he is now saying everyone who is
concerned about the illegal alien
invasion as a white supremacist
he suddenly has joined who he's like
jake tapper now and the rest on cnn
that was a mistake mr president i am
sorry that is going to cost you
thousands if not tens of thousands of
votes
listen again to the big mistake donald
trump made today
by not listening to the right people not
having wise men around them
but having fools around them listen to
this clip
six the shooter in el paso posted a
manifesto online
consumed by racist hate
in one voice our nation must condemn
racism
bigotry and white supremacy
these sinister ideologies do you
understand what he just said
he has now combined racism
hatred what else do you say condemn
racism
we all agree with that on all sides by
the way including hispanic racism
hispanic bigotry
of the type espoused almost daily by
occasional cortex
okay all right this guy's an idiot um
but you know this is the this is just
like the dumb lowdown this isn't the
stuff that's more you know this isn't
the tucker stuff that needs actual
thinking and strategy this is just
the pure base racist stuff and this is
of course a major part of how trump and
republicans win
now that's important and of course
um i actually want to get to harris next
donald trump and he did not say this
after the terrorist atrocity at the
christchurch
shooting he did not say this uh donald
trump but he acknowledged that the el
paso shooter
uh part of his manifesto was one of
white supremacy and racism it was also
one of um eco scarcity
as well so there's a lot of dynamics
there
so but we know
that there is a global ideology
right now that is of white nationalism
white supremacy and we also know more
broadly there's a
there's a resurgent nationalism some of
which likes to
uh disaggregate itself from overt racism
uh there's a really prominent israeli
intellectual whose
name is escaping me at the moment but
he's sort of the architect of this
uh as a sort of cerebral movement he's
very tight with netanyahu
um it is spanning the globe
hungary united states poland brazil
and then different variants but in a
synchronized fashion
turkey philippines india russia
obviously israel we see this
specifically when it comes to white
supremacy rhetoric we know that the
rhetoric
of replacement the horror
of birth rates the obsession with
refugees
this is a through line that connects and
parallels the el paso terrorist
manifesto
and the christ church terrorist
manifesto now sam harris
and i just want to say it seems to me
from this clip
i have given myself a pass from
listening to this guy's
talk in this dreary voice ever since i
finished the chapter
on him in my forthcoming book from zero
books so i will stipulate
that maybe before this whole clip were
about to play
sam said i would be a complete and utter
idiot and hypocrite to say
in which case it would be violently out
of context and we will apologize for it
and so on
and obviously you know i know everything
with sam is out of context
that's still the shtick but it seems to
me in my interpretation of what he
appears to be saying here
is that one he's getting a lot less
careful
and two that this is truly extraordinary
because sam's just horrifically
childish a historical writing about
islam
that it was basically to understand this
massive complex phenomenon from
terrorism to the nature of the religion
itself to over a billion people that
span
from senegal to kansas you just needed
to read a couple of hadith and quran
quotes in english translation you didn't
need to know any history you didn't need
to know anything about international
affairs you didn't need to know about
different competing philosophical
religious forces in islam i mean
again people don't like to hear this and
they like to say that it's being
politically correct but literally this
is
embarrassing it is embarrassing to
reduce things to that level
and you know the response from people
that defended sam was like oh well you
just don't want to
confront that there is a toxic ideology
here that's an animating group like
al-qaeda and of course it was like yes
absolutely there's a toxic ideology here
that's animating group like al qaeda
and we have to look at why one element
could be that the quran is easy to use
uh you know by these people right that
maybe we could
confront things in terms of some of the
aspects of the text that would certainly
be true of the bible or the torah it's
definitely true of some hindu literature
these things can be used and distorted
in certain ways the primary thing for
serious we'd have to look at saudi and
u.s
foreign policy not in terms of just
doing wrong to people but just in terms
of literally materially what ideology
was funded
as an example through the mujahideen why
did the pakistanis and the saudis always
pick the most extreme
mujahideen fighters as an example
obviously none of these things they were
interested in dealing with
but the point was was that sam's whole
shtick was
it's just you know you have beliefs and
then you have actions and that's all
that matters
and now what he appears to be saying and
this is just incredible
in this if this is what he's saying what
he appears to be saying this
unbelievably delusional way
now he's of course he's still not going
to go to broader historical political
conditions because he doesn't think like
that
but in a case where you have
a literal manifesto from a literal
terrorist
except this terrorist is talking about
white supremacy
and in fact if you know if you're sam
you want to take all the fbi
statistics and everything else seriously
we all know that these
that white supremacist terrorism is
infinitely bigger threat to all of us
particularly obviously people of color
in the united states and uh
uh and europe uh new zealand and islam
listen to what sam harris has to say
about this there are people
it seems who fall into one of these two
categories
who are living in an online
culture of trolling now where
killing people and writing semi bogus or
entirely bogus
manifestos merely designed to confuse
the media is becoming a new phenomenon
right these are people who are not moved
by a sincere ideology
they're just quote posting the
behavior of
trolling on websites like 4chan and 8th
gen
has been exported to the real world in
the form of
mass murder designed as a troll
and at some degree i believe the christ
church shooting
in the mosque had this form right it's
still not
entirely clear what happened there so
this is a okay it's an out there yeah i
mean look you can read his manifesto
and again it's so funny to me because
i'll just do you know sam harris islam
talk right now which is it's a manifesto
it exists you can read it
he stated his own beliefs these things
are all readily available for anybody to
read if they want to read
and it goes beyond the manifesto the
christchurch killer was in email contact
with martin sellner of the identity
movement
right this is a very important part
right i'll read briefly from this an
australian far-right an austrian
far-right leader with ties to american
fascists
sent a coffee invitation to a man now
accused of murdering 50 million muslims
in christ church
in new zealand martin selner the leader
of the austrian identitarian movement
received approximately one thousand
seven hundred dollar donation
from brett and torrent in early 2018.
sellner and his movement push racist
conspiracy theories including one that
torrent used as the title
of his manifesto as he allegedly
murdered 50 million were 50
worshippers in march after the financial
ties were revealed selner tried to
distance himself from torrent
but austrian german outlets reported
this week that sellner had exchanged
emails with torrent
until at least july 2018
and that both men invited each other to
their respective countries
so and uh
moving forward selmer confirmed the
email's authenticities
so and just a another little button on
cellner is he uh was part of this
uh with brittany pettibone and lauren
southern they wanted to do
an anti-refugee boat in like the uk and
they were denied entry for that
lauren southern uh you might wanna you
might uh understand why media fascists
like uh
stephen crowder and ben shapiro are so
worried about this lauren sutherland is
a regular
was a guest on both of their shows right
she literally was talking about going on
boats
and throwing things if i understand
correctly at refugees
and the month before she appeared on ben
shapiro's show she has a video
reacting to i think an attack in london
about like well we all like our nice
nice lives but isn't anybody going to do
anything because 100 years from now
demographics might be a bit different
like she this this is who we're dealing
with this is who
uh basically the alt light has been
promoting
right absolutely and go and you know
again when you and so and sam harris
has plenty of lines that you can look up
that people like many hussein and
murtaza hussein have documented that
say in his laborious
you know thought experiment way convey
very similar sentiment
to selner and and southern like that's
again that's just reality and in fact he
himself said at one point several years
ago that it will be the only the
fascists who speak honestly if we don't
get real about islam
i'm paraphrasing once again i know out
of context out of context out of context
but this is just extraordinary because
what you have here and look
people liberals who are running around
saying that now we need to
treat this like terrorism heart like and
exp
you know pete buda jack has a horrifying
dystopian oh let's
let's in re import which by the way it
already was being used on muslim
populations to a significant extent
the tactics of terrorism and
counterinsurgency that we've used abroad
that have killed
so many innocent people that have caused
so many problems
no of course that's not the answer of
course again we need to look at the
material conditions in a
broad sense what is the role of social
alienation
what is the role of isolation what is
the role of unaddressed histories of
racism and bigotry and white supremacy
and
and male supremacy what is the role of
technology and how that uh
loops back with a lack of real bonds how
does this relate
to the changing economy and even if
they're relatively more
uh better off still diminished
opportunities
all of these things need to be addressed
as bill fletcher jr said right-wing
populism is the herpes of capitalism
sam harris i guess i'm sure he's got
some spiel about social media companies
but
i don't hear anything structural in that
and this is of course exactly the
analysis
he had no time for did his best to
demonize when it was about
over a billion people in the most
important foreign policy questions of
our time
then on the other hand maybe they were
just posted yeah maybe look
well no precisely though because again
if you read the research of an actual
person who does
actual work on these things like scott
atron he actually did document
in this case not the posting but
actually things like
social bonds and lack of purpose and why
is it that there's a correlation with
like petty crime
and going into terrorism and this is all
like this is ridiculous
because i read a translation of the
hadith and you can
see it documented in isis's own
documents
sam harris is actually saying with a
straight face he's not doing his
previous game which is
you know oh you forget that jeff
sessions is attorney general and donald
trump is president white supremacy is a
weird fringe thing in society saying
precisely
exactly saying exactly what tucker
carlson says without any of tucker
carlson's interesting content i might
add or any of his understanding of class
and then you know what he's doing in
this one
is after a career of saying you don't
need to really do any serious analysis
of anything involving the most pressing
racial foreign policy issues of our time
oh
well in this case you can just ignore
the manifesto that's right yeah
it's just that's just
complex ways foreign had no idea that
sam harris was such a post-modernist
now again i'll say again this is what it
appears to be from this clip
and i did notice in that clip it seemed
like he was actually too
finely somewhat to his credit he did
seem to be speaking a lot more clearly
and not sort of giving so many you know
booby traps and outs and thought
experiments and other nonsense to evade
making his point as he always did with
islam but if that is what he's putting
across
wow i mean that's just unreal is there
anything else uh we got a little bit
more and then i want to bring christian
picciolini into here okay
had this form right still not entirely
clear
what happened there so this is a
kind of derangement that
social media has introduced into our
lives
where some people are willing to commit
murder and even mass murder
simply to enjoy the spectacle
it creates online again they're either
crazy or evil or both but
in certain cases the reasons for their
behavior
are not as they appear right and the
media
seems to get very confused about whoa
what
are you serious there
has to be no you know what i'm sorry
even i have to believe that this is a
truncated quote and sam harris said
here is a parody of what i would say
if i was in the most bald way
contradicting everything i've ever said
past the point of human credulity and
comprehension
there's no way we that has to be taken
out of context sam i apologize in
advance
there's no way there is no way
after you reducing thousands of years of
human history
and cultural development to a couple of
passages in a holy book
whose original language you don't even
read or comprehend
and no foreign policy understanding that
you say you can understand all of that
and that bad beliefs lead to bad actions
etc etc
and in this case with a known manifesto
that you can read by the way in the same
language that was written within weeks
that echoes all of the rhetoric of
global nationalist politics right now
that we just can't say what's going on
in front of our own eyes
there's no way you have to be joking
it's got to be a joke and in fact i had
no idea sam harris was funny
you know what's also rich about this is
uh he's sort of
boulderizing a christian picciolini take
that i think actually
probably is true and i think this is
where the grain of truth is that maybe
sam harris defenders might want to come
at us with
here's what picciolini said have also
noticed a phenomenon i call cult hopping
in young extremists
they help from extreme to another far
left to far-right or vice versa
also nazi to isis it's a broken search
for identity community and purpose
this is less about ideology than most
people think and i think that's
definitely true 100
true and this is exactly what sam harris
said was
nonsense when scott atron who actually
does ethnographic research
and has actually you know i don't know
talked to isis members
spent time in this region he said it was
all of the things that christian
piccolini says who by the way
incidentally christian piccolini is a
ex-nazi who exits people from these
groups maybe he would
have fallen out with sam harris but if
it was sam harris because sam harris
needed to defend the honor of staff and
mullin you apparently
uh i can't remember i don't remember
what it was they had a falling out what
a surprise
but bitchelina was right of course
piccolini was right we don't need to
know what it was no picciolini was right
so that's incredible
so even if so if you come at us with the
grain of truth of what sam's saying here
yeah which uh by the way i just want to
hasten to add picciolini was not saying
that about
christchurch he was absolutely not
saying that about christ's church but i
do want to just say more broadly if you
want to say the
the grain of search that sam harris is
identifying contradicts
every single thing that he said that he
has ever said about terrorism in islam
so great take that line of inquiry
read scott atron read steve cole get a
proper understanding of these things
because
at this point as we deal with ascendant
white nationalist terrorism and
governments
we um well we really needed to not have
the same failures to begin with when it
came to the middle east and south asia
but uh in a very self-interested way if
you live in the united states
you cannot apply the same horrific
national security state
policies and rank stupidity of analysis
that people like sam harris brought
forward but that really is i mean i
again i really remain
i want to keep putting on the record
that i uh
20 of me for the fact that i have zero
respect for sam harris
that has to be taken away there's no way
that he's saying that literally
you know they're spelling that out
sounds somewhat invidious
and we don't really have time to clean
up the mess
[Laughter]
see describing his whole career oh my
god that is
unbelievable like that
actually even me again
i have zero none no respect for sam
harris and people
there's still people who whine to me
about it it's incredible but like
that is just amazing my entire career is
under threat now because i just thought
occurred to me that
what if muslims are posting too
[Laughter]
could you imagine if after
there was an isis beheading and somebody
was just like
you know you have someone like jihadi
john who's directionless
and disturbed and has some bad
experiences with the british national
security state and he's kind of
shitposting a little bit he's looking
for direction and purpose
and then you know there's this political
vacuum that gets opened up
sam harris will be the first to call you
a morally relative
every term in the book it and it's just
what's so incredible is that
there's nothing wrong with a little bit
of clarity about isis or the christ
church shooting
you just have to say okay how do we
actually deal with it which of course
sam had nothing for
but it is amazing if that clip is
correct
to see him just in the most
naked terms contradict like the whole
point of really his very relatively you
know his totally boring and anodyne
model like yeah people believe bad
things so they do bad things it's like
it's the reverse fundamentalist
fundamentalism model where you take
the written word of any sort of
scripture as like exactly how
fundamentalist would read take
that is just i'm sorry i'm still
actually
blazing from that all right we got a few
more things to get to we got to end
really soon so i'm going to do
one last call you're calling from a 408
area code who are you where are you
calling from
408 are you there
oh 408 are you there is this me yes
what's your name where are you calling
from uh hi this is sarah i'm in indiana
hi sarah what's on your mind
hi um well we've been talking a lot
about uh gun control this week right
right so first seeing basically an
upswing and white supremacist vigilante
is
would would you say that's right i think
so
yeah so
like i'm just not sure how the solution
to that is
like directing the white supremacist
police state to disarm people from like
communities that are most vulnerable to
that violence
well i guess the argument i mean look i
think the stronger argument against gun
control is that
how is that first the how small scale
what's actually on
tap is how much of an influence that
could actually have and the other one is
that
you know enforcement of new aggressive
gun laws will
absolutely i mean stop and frisk is the
result of gun laws in new york
but the reason that you would direct the
state to do that is because
i mean one we know that you know
there's no liberal or left version of a
good guy with a gun stopping this stuff
that's
not how it works and that in fact if you
took away
mass-powered artillery from like
if this guy in el paso didn't legally
have that gun collection
he would not be able to commit the
extent of the atrocity committed so
that's the argument that i see for it
but i
i do understand your concern thank you
for the call
um all right uh
sorry guys really gotta gotta get going
here
i'll take one more one more
call
[Music]
let me see i don't see that
one okay uh
let's see one more call you're calling
from an 847 area code who are you where
are you calling from
hey uh michael it's josh from chicago
hey josh what's on your minds
uh two quick things um first of all i
mean uh you talked about ill on omar
and briefly i'll say this because i had
a conversation with a friend who's a
centrist liberal
although who likes bernie thinks bernie
would be a good nominee
um and he called illinois devices and of
course i i met ilana
she would go in dc she's a good friend
of mine um
she did not ask me to dehorn myself
because of my my jew horns
um but i think the reason people find
her devices is that she's a woman of
color
because if you look at and this is like
centrist liberals right you look at her
message it's not that different from
bernie sanders
well i don't think i don't think most of
your friend i think your friend's very
weird outlier to be honest because i
don't know
any personally i don't know a single
person who supports bernie sanders that
doesn't like elon omar so
that doesn't make any sense tonight most
people who think she's divisive that are
on the center it's because of israel
stuff and frankly
that has nothing to do that has nothing
to do i mean it's amplified by her
background but these are the same people
that are
very excited to elevate someone like
cherise davids or something so
i don't think that's really the dynamic
with that one amongst uh
the centrist liberal types obviously
amongst the conservatives it is
josh i am really tight on time you got
anything else real quick
uh yeah about the kabon thing um i would
say
don't mourn organize um it is
unfortunate that caban will not win
um she conceded i was at her confession
uh confession
well i saw a confession of speech um but
uh the fact that we came within 55 votes
means we have a lot of power
do you know when uh katz is up for
re-election is it a two-year term or a
four-year term four years
it's a four-year term all right because
i think there would have been a
re-election this year regardless i mean
there was
it was bumped up because the guy died
right but um i mean
you know don't more organize i will say
this one thing um
we talked about uh you talked about the
difference between elizabeth warren and
bernie sanders both endorsed her
warren did not put in the work that was
required to get caban
that was required for an endorsement um
you know sending around a few emails was
not good enough
right bernie you know i got text
messages from bernie about
going in for recounts and for me too
this is the fundamental difference
so yeah i agree with you 100 bernie's a
movement candidate he gets it
and and don't listen i mean i'm sorry i
like elizabeth warren i like what she
put forward today i like her in some
ways but when she but when she
says structural change that is a again
it is a
light pale imitation of what bernie it's
technocratic and bernie's doing it
he's doing it now he is running the race
that is the administration and it's
fundamentally transformative and it has
a and also if you look at the
cross-racial working-class coalition
it's exactly what's necessary to win
thank you josh uh this uh
uh one point i want to make on that is
there's a certain type of part of the um
let's say libertarian left that likes to
downplay the significance of say
krasner's win or d.a victories
um across the country and i would just
say that the
degree to which machines are willing to
fight those shows you how important
they actually are oh my god are you
kidding me
d.a races are you cannot possibly
emphasize
how important da races are um
all right we'll get to a few more
stories we're running later than we're
supposed to be but that's okay
um sorry
what did you say okay um
you know what let's let's just we gotta
just do this
i don't we'll just play um
this is just more witness bearing uh
this is
children crying after their parents were
deported in mississippi
uh from this massive ice raid yesterday
i don't know do we not have it if we
don't have it we can go to honduras
all right let's do honduras instead i so
let me just say i'm sure that uh sam
will cover mississippi tomorrow
uh you know the rocky man that was
murdered by ice
obviously in some ways serves a similar
function although this is an ongoing
crisis now because
they've uprooted this children by
kidnapping their parents it's
it's terrorism we know what it is and we
just have to keep
uh shining the light shining a light
until we can win
and destroy these people and never allow
it to happen again
and pay restitution and everything else
um in
honduras a lot of the propaganda that is
used against venezuela says venezuela is
a narco state
i don't there absolutely are elements of
the venezuelan military as an example
that are involved in cartel business
it just so happens that cocaine
generates a huge amount of revenue
and cocaine has been something that the
cia and u.s foreign policy have been
intimately involved with through their
proxies in latin america
death squads right-wing juntas and
everything else and today
in honduras several years after a coup
that the obama administration backed in
2009 that removed manuel zelaya from
office you cannot
understand the migrant crisis going back
several years to the extent and when i
say crisis let me be very clear
it's not a crisis of people that can't
come to this country and be helped
that's easy and no problem we would do
it if we were humane and not racist
but there is a crisis going back to
2013 2012 of a situation that is so bad
in honduras where you had children as
young as five years old walking by
themselves thousands of miles to a
border
that is a crisis and that crisis flows
out of the coup that the united states
backed
and the current government it supports
of
uh of of president uh orlando hernandez
thousands of people are in the streets
demanding he step down because of his
far-right policies
and because of his close connections to
the cartel trade u.s southern district
court new york
in and filed documents have said that
hernandez has received proceeds of over
1.5
has received 1.5 million in proceed drug
proceeds
that were used to bribe local officials
in exchange for protection and
completion
of public works projects and i'm quote
one more quote from telus or
conservative ally of the united states
honduras has come under increasing
pressure since his younger brother tony
was arrested in miami in november on
drug trafficking charges
uh this is some footage of thousands of
people protesting
that uh narco must go joh
must go into gol cigalpa and honduras
trump administration's tight with this
government the u.s has backed
right-wing coup governments under obama
and
trump and this is another major issue
that needs to be addressed all
solidarity
with the people of honduras let's just
play i'll stop talking
[Applause]
there you have it um in brazil yesterday
as part of this
broader far-right um push and again
2009 is crucial the coup in honduras
was the signal that u.s foreign policy
starting under the obama administration
was actually going to accelerate
its response to rolling back the pink
tied progressive governments which
really dominated latin america from 2000
to 2014 and that is
also why regardless of any specific
criticisms there are many
of venezuela cuba and nicaragua we have
to see
the trump coup and regime change efforts
there as part of this same process and
obviously there would never be any
improvement in anybody's rights
a worsening of the right situation and
oligarchy
brazil's the prime example of that
in uh ongoingly glenn greenwald who is
of course under threat from
uh jair bolsonaro and from the corrupt
justice minister sergio moro the
politically motivated judge who put lula
in jail they're threatening glenn
greenwald on a daily basis
um there's assassination threats and
there's also political and journalistic
threats including
deporting him from the country illegally
investigating his finances and so on
people including jake tapper and tucker
carlson
have condemned what the brazilian
government is doing to glenn
so he is under real threat
lula in spite of all of the revelations
that the lava jotto process just yeah
and the new revelations are of the lead
prosecutor delton taking money for
speeches to
banks and other corporations which is
also completely unethical
in spite of all of these revelations and
the absolute transparency of the
political process that made lula a
political prisoner and took him off the
ballot even though he was
leading bolsonaro by double digits and
that means if lula was able to run he
would be president right now you would
not have this
aggressive deforestation of the amazon
you would have the most powerful country
in latin america that could be somewhat
of a counterweight to the trump
administration
and you wouldn't have murders of
indigenous people you wouldn't have
all of these different things that are
first and foremost horrifying for the
people of brazil but actually have a
global impact
annulling the 2018 election releasing
lula from prison has global implications
for democracy
and yesterday even if the courts have
still not released this political
prisoner
there was a horrifying move that came in
the beginning of the day
which was that there was an announcement
that lula was going to move
uh a from prisons currently he's in
curtiba
in police headquarters in a uh
a sort of makeshift prison he's held in
solitary confinement very repressive
conditions
but he is not in what is an incredibly
dangerous uh you know open population
politician
uh prisons for a former two-term
president
so those are the conditions he's been
held in it was announced yesterday that
he was
moving to sao paulo and the first
reaction was that this was a positive
signal because the presentation was that
yes he
this regional court judge said yes he
has a right to be close to his family
but there was immediate concerns because
this judge is close to moro
who again the the justice minister who's
been exposed
um uh in his corruption with lava jato
and who has an
extreme vindictive uh horrifying record
with lula which goes back
uh years including of course making him
a political prisoner
lula's lawyer said we didn't ask for
this transfer and in fact we don't want
it we're very worried about it
the uh morrow wanted to uh still
push it forward and um
[Music]
this basically a quote now briefly from
brazil wire
uh lula's defense team quickly acted to
prevent the transfer since the condition
of brazil's penitentiaries is dismal and
the transfer would likely put lula's
life in danger i mean this really did
seem like
they were attempting to publicly
orchestrate him being killed or
significantly harmed
the action sparked a huge mobilization
by lula's supporters in social media
to the point that by the day's end in an
equally surprising move
several parties in congress including
brazil's equivalent of the speaker of
the house rodrigo
maya a staunch opponent of lula and a
key supporter of
bolsonaro called on the supreme on the
sdf the country's supreme court to stop
the transfer in a similarly unexpected
action by a court
known for its continued support for the
path leading to bolsonaro's election
including lula's illegal removal from
the election last year
the stf rule tend to ruled in a ten to
one vote
to annul the decision of judge sacri
guaranteeing lula's stay
in carditiba um
so now actually as dangerous and as
horrifying as that was yesterday
some people read this as a very positive
signal because this specif the flagrancy
of this move was actually opposed by
some very right-wing forces who demanded
the supreme court stop
it and as the daily endless revelation
of all of the just rot and corruption of
lava jato
this whole scam uh process which has led
to the election of a fascist president
who is destroying
so much of the earth's bio sphere and
harming so many in brazil
that that pushback and the supreme court
finally even though obviously they
should have never put lula in jail to
begin with and so on
that they're totally compromised in this
might mean that this is part of a
broader pushback on unraveling but it
remains an incredibly dangerous
situation
bernie sanders and rokhana have spoken
on this aoc and elon omar and others
have signed
petitions but way more needs to be done
on this from progressive forces united
states and another thing and it is a
it's just disgusting that bernie's the
only presidential candidate who's called
for the release of lula let alone any
you know the most major mainline
politician other than roe connor to
speak clearly on this another i mean
look tulsi gabbard please she's so
progressive she hasn't said anything
about this because she practices in my
view a form of isolationism doesn't
speak on these things
that's my speculation the only reason as
to why she wouldn't
elizabeth warren has no concept of
courage and solidarity on these issues
it's the blunt fact that's why she's
been totally silent
and these other candidates by all
appearances indicate leading with joe
biden
joe biden is a major architect of things
like what's happened in honduras
his record along with the drug war in
latin america is despicable and
dishonorable and there's no indication
that any of these other candidates
harris buddha judge
would do anything to change and reform
that relationship which
is so damaging to them and in fact is
generating uh
these other broader problems all right
folks
uh one more i am geopolitical politics
the film sorry to bother you is a great
companion piece to the interview you had
about
on the clock the low-wage work what
low-wage work did to me and how it
drives america
insane that you uh that you all did the
other day yes sorry dubai
is great everybody should see it
everybody should see it it's a really
really good movie
thanks everybody
to get to where i
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah i know the clock is
[Music]
shining bright
