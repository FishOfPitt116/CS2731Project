now
uh ladies and gentlemen as you know
tucker carlson
um has been um
been having some issues lately with
appearances that he made
almost 10 years ago
on a radio show now
where um he's talked in the past about
having um
you know uh issues like
this so-called rapist is going to take
care of somebody for
the rest of their life i mean can you
really charge him with rape
uh so he has a slight misunderstanding
of
of rapists and um
he also apparently um now to be fair
this was ten years ago of course
uh nobody would be talking about
a rock on uh radio anymore because
nobody cares anymore
we've killed all these people uh but
here is uh tucker carlson
um talking about his uh sense of the
iraqis and and these are clips that
range from uh 2006 to 2008 or so
uh let's listen to so this isn't a
one-off maybe we're misinterpreting what
he's saying let's listen
and you decide
is a crappy place filled with a bunch a
rock is a crappy place filled with a
bunch of
you know semi-literate monkey but i just
have zero
closet for one second a rock is a a
place a crappy place
uh filled with semi-literate monkeys
now
i don't imagine there's a lot of people
out there who need me to
um justify the statement that that is
incorrect and racist
uh it's not meant to be taken literal
there's always there's not literal
semi-literate monkeys oh he's just
referring to the people there as
a semi-led so he's not saying that's a
country full of really smart
monkeys what he means is that because
they are we shouldn't go to war with
them so i don't
agree but maybe we could build a
alliance to end war
but i just have zero sympathy for them
or their culture a culture where people
just don't use toilet paper or forks
i can tell you that in addition to using
toilet paper and forks
in iraq um by 2006
it was quite clear there was no threat
to this country
whatsoever there was
our defense department i believe by 2006
was releasing defense department numbers
that we were responsible for the deaths
of over a hundred thousand
civilians i imagine uh that number is
significantly higher now
on defense department numbers
which uh certainly were at the low end
of assessments of how many hundreds of
thousands
of people were civilians were killed
never mind i know by 2006 we were
talking about 2 million displaced
refugees 2 million internally displaced
2 million that were sent out of the
country
but he has no sympathy for these people
he cheerleaded this war too i can tell
you that right now
um the the american public
by certainly by may 30th of 2006
was aware of all these things that's why
they uh in part
got rid of the republicans and the way
they treat women you know i i agree with
you
their culture is but you're in their
homeland
and you're over there as an american i
will also say the way
they treated women in uh saddam
hussein's iraq was probably one of the
most progressive things about that
regime yeah i'm sure he cares a lot
about the way they treat women
indeed and if they didn't have toilet
paper and the saddam
era because of our sanctions the co-host
is saying this
here's tucker's response american who
they hate and they want nothing more
than the americans off of their soil so
they're not going to play i mean they
can just shut the up and obey is my
view
how could you salvage iraq at this point
i don't you know it's beyond our control
i mean if somehow the iraqis decided to
behave like human beings or something
he'd need to say look i'm a bigot okay
i'm a bigot i don't
like islamic extremists like if you are
really heavily into islam i really i'm
sorry i just don't i don't care for you
that much and i don't care what that
sounds like you can call me a racist you
can tell the you want and
at this juncture you could say that and
not catch a lot of for certainly
could i vote for you if you said that
you know white men you know they've
contributed some
i would say like creating civilization
and stuff i think they've done a pretty
i don't know whatever
right uh white men created civilization
thank you uh thank you white guys just a
note on uh the semi-literate monkeys
comment iraq was actually more literate
than many u.s states prior to the
invasion well there you go yeah but it
was to oppose war
uh so there's uh tucker carlson now
i suppose you could say like oh you
could cherry pick a couple of isolated
statements over the course of two years
that's not indicative of the man
these are incidentally statements that
were made on public radio uh commercial
you know like
i i think it's not actually in fact
public radio right now
the love sponge wasn't it after morning
edition
publicly broadcasted late radio let me
just say that
something so low on npr tucker carlson's
a scumbag
if fox wants to maintain tucker carlson
on their payroll
um they can do so
but the folks who own
uh fox should be completely
uh ostracized from uh society for
allowing someone like that on their
broadcast i mean
uh that's just the bottom line
well they should be already for
everything that they've done right
they're
basically a disinformation outlet at
this point in time
and it's at the end and the information
it's it's not even just that they're
disinformation outlet
it is that they are a disgusting
disinformation
i would i think it's worth doing a
little memory lane trip at some point
though to recognize that
obviously the vulgarity
stands out but i remember that time like
now this is the time where i
you know i was very well aware of what
people were saying and
you even i mean you had democrats like
dick durbin couching their criticisms
of ongoing operations in iraq is
literally
we've done enough for those people they
need to clean up their own mess
after we had invaded and killed hundreds
of thousands
of them so obviously it stands out
because of just how disgusting it is but
in that context of that time there was
a just a uniformity well that's totally
human that's the only way you can get
out of a war right
if you've gone in there like we did and
uh
invaded a country it has to be
ultimately well we've got to leave
because it's their fault
they're not good they're not right they
don't show enough gratitude for the fact
that we came in they don't show enough
and bomb them back into another age
there was a super bizarre time were the
only people and it was a total lie and
fake obviously but the only people who
spoke with any even
feign public respect about iraqis on
mainstream media were bush
administration officials who were like
we're going to give them democracy they
deserve it
