with us in studio today congresswoman
alexandria ocasio-cortez
congresswoman welcome uh welcome back to
the pie hi thank you for having me
um so this is the first time we've had
you on since you took office
i remember in the first year of the
obama white house
uh there were quite a few times where we
looked at each other and said wow
washington is even worse than we said it
was on the campaign
have you had moments like that yes i
have had moments like that um in other
ways though
it has been better than what i expected
where has it been worse and where has it
been better uh
worse in that i see how laws are made
and i am shocked you know i sometimes i
feel
as though if people really saw what our
legislative process was like
it would be a national scandal sometimes
um but it's been better in that
i actually i think i was more cynical
about the capacity for change even going
in and now i actually
surprisingly believe that it's even more
possible than i
had thought going in not that i thought
it was impossible going in but
seeing how a lot of these dynamics work
i feel
more hopeful now more than ever about
the possibility of grassroots politics
what what has made you more hopeful than
you thought you'd be
well i think so many of our decisions
are
based and on public sentiment
and i believe that if we can really
unlock the ability to transform and
change and focus
on moving public sentiment then we can
really open up our possibilities
of of what we're capable in dc and
granted i think that i and our team and
and some other members are in a unique
capacity we haven't had this
strange fusion of politics and pop
culture in this way
since i think frankly the the 60s
but it's an enormous opportunity that we
have and i think we should use it
so on an issue like immigration where
democrats couldn't pass a on their own
a clean humanitarian funding bill that
included protections for migrants and
children
um like where do we go from here do we
is there no choice on immigration but to
wait until 2020 like what progress do
you think we can make between now
well i do think that out of all of the
issues
immigration is is probably the most
difficult within the democratic party i
think that it is the single most
challenging issue
within the party because we have members
from all over the country
and we have members that want really
tough districts and immigration is the
one issue that really touches
a big nerve and so it's a challenge
it's a really big challenge and it's one
that for me coming from a district
that's 50
immigrant i come from one of the most
diverse districts
arguably the most diverse district in
the country in terms of languages spoken
over 200 languages are spoken in in my
community and it's
it's tough to reconcile that it it
really does get very difficult
what uh what lessons did you learn from
the last sort of immigration funding
battle
for next time well i learned
i learned that i learned where a lot of
the fault lines are
and a lot of these decisions you know
when we talk about
how legislation is made it's
made a lot of times um there's a long
process where people are kind of
writing it and toiling over it but
really the chips fall within 48 hours
everyone finds out whether we're going
to vote on a bill
48 hours before that vote happens and so
a lot of times there's this massive
scramble
looking for things because a lot of
people who see these bills initially are
only those folks where the bill has
moved through that committee where
they've been able to really comb through
it
um not everyone may be on that relevant
committee where there may have been a
hearing on it or not
and so um so one of the things that i've
learned is where those fault lines are
i've also learned where some of our
strong points are as a party and where
some of our weak points are as a party i
think
internal communication is a weak point
within the party
and um even between the senate and the
house
you know that immigration bill i think
schumer thought some things were
happening
pelosi thought something else might have
been happening and it
members within the caucus didn't know
what other members of the caucus were
trying to to do
and so it created this this huge tension
out of a lack of communication i think
it does seem like so much of the
immigration debate
is driven by fear politicians have the
fear
obviously there's fear among voters i
mean to me it seems like
even hopefully long after donald trump
is gone
this is going to be a dominant political
issue not just in america but around the
world
we're going to have more asylum seekers
more refugees
more climate refugees how do we start
changing the politics around this issue
so that
in districts that aren't like yours or
that aren't on the border
it's not driven by fear well this is
really tough because
there's the short-term political work
that a lot of people are engaged in
which is winning elections
and then there's the long-term political
work which is
transforming the ethos of the country
and really debating our long-term values
and
immigration as you said this is going to
be a global issue
climate change alone is going to drive
hundreds of thousands of people to be
changing and migrating across the world
and people
say that and especially on the right
they think it's a joke
but a lot of our wars and a lot of our
conflict is going to be over
droughts it's going to be over uh lack
of resources it's going to be over food
shortages in many parts of the country
people are going to be forced to migrate
they are already migrating because
places where they once lived are no
longer livable
and um and frankly
migration is a is within
our human nature ever since the dawn
of humanity humans have migrated it is a
natural it is it is as natural as eating
and breathing
um and we're going to have to figure out
how to
show people that it's it's actually
really not a big deal
we see if anything it's positive yeah
where migrants go regardless of their
background regardless of
how poor or rich they are where migrants
grow prosperity follows
and there is a myth that the president
is peddling
because he's peddling a zero-sum vision
of the world
right and um but it really deepens to
having national conversations about race
and they're very uncomfortable and
i think that a huge part of this moment
right now is because we've been kicking
this can down the road
and it's been getting worse and worse
and worse and there's a huge fear
around a changing america and when we
can't avoid that conversation
and we want to in the short term to win
an election yeah
but if we keep not talking about it
it's only going to get worse well this
is you know
i keep having this thought about the
2020 election where
to me there's this central tension
where you know donald trump wants to
make this election
about race and immigration and white
identity politics
and i think that's a fight that
democrats
have to join that we can't avoid at the
same time
you know we just did a a poll in
wisconsin
and it was a messaging poll and the
messages that
moved voters furthest away from trump
were
economic in nature it was about his
medicare cuts his tax cuts his trade war
with china
how do we how do we sort of reconcile
the need to you know battle donald trump
on race on issues of race but also get
an economic message through that we know
will sort of galvanize a majority of
people
well i think one of the things that we
need to do is
really dismantle this idea that
it's either race issues or class issues
we need to learn how to talk about this
intersectionally
and it's going to take a lot of
white people yeah we need white people
right now
to do the work we need white people to
organize themselves
and and to do that kind of work you know
in my campaign there was this
really phenomenal local organization but
they're also national in nature they
were
once known as well they're still known
as surge stand up for racial justice
in our community they've kind of spun
off into their own local community
organization
but it's it's white people talking to
other white people about race and
that i think is a lot of what we're
going to need
um in addition to a whole lot of
other work because racism is economic
and we need to a lot of the long-term
work that we have to do on a lot of
different issues is educational
and there's a reason that donald trump
is using racism as a cultural because
it's how he gets
away with his corruption it's how he
gets so that's how he steals the bag
you know it is it is with racism well
it's a point too where
racism doesn't only hurt people of color
it hurts
white people as well because donald
trump's base isn't making out any better
right right from what's happening and
he's going to use racism
and he's going to try to the reason he's
trying to center
issues of race of immigration etc is to
sink the economic agenda he's trying to
eclipse it
and the only reason that that has power
is because
we refuse to talk about it and so
race is going to be an issue and the key
is if
we're going to allow him to define that
conversation
or if we're going to assert ourselves
into that space and to find that
conversation
um you gave a speech that went viral
last week where you called on young
people who find themselves
being radicalized by white supremacy to
quote come back
because there's a mother waiting for you
i know there's a teacher waiting for you
we will love you back you are not too
far gone it struck me as
a message that conveyed something that
you don't
hear much in our political conversation
which is grace
what what made you want to say that
well a lot of it does have to deal with
the fact that i have listened
to those moms i was
maybe a day or two before i was actually
at the mall in queens my
my now god daughter we were getting a
christening dress for her
and i was in this um
i was actually in a disney store and i
one of the employees at the store came
to me and said you know i'm so thankful
that you're representing us and she said
my son
has been is is kind of falling into this
funnel and he
it's really hard to feel like i'm losing
him yeah
and i hear this all the time about
families that are being torn apart by
this radicalization and it's
hurting so many people and this
political polarization it's
it's not just within our politics it's
personal right
people's marriages are strained their
friendships are string they feel like
they can't even talk to their loved ones
and that is the power of white supremacy
that is what
this cult like culture
that the president is cultivating is
doing to us
and the only way that we're going to get
past this
is with grace and it's on grace on
on both ends it's not just the white
supremacist
and it's not just young people that are
falling into this funnel
we need to have grace with ourselves
to acknowledge our past
mistakes and i think in our
conversations about race
the immediate um the the immediate
conver
the immediate emotions that come up are
defensiveness
you know like if i for example pointed
out something
that you may have said in this
conversation it's like well i didn't
mean that you know there's this
defensiveness that comes up
and i think that we have to show that
conversations about race
can be safe they can be even if you have
made a mistake or even if you have
stepped into outright hatred that
the conversation can still be safe it
can be loving
so long as we are at least
open to the possibility of moving
forward together yeah
this i struggle with this all the time
because
you know i i'm an obama person i worked
for him for a long time
you know i have this desire to not see
this constant polarization in political
warfare
trump becomes president and there's this
debate about you know
are trump voters racist and clearly
you see the rallies you see some of the
stuff online and there's racism there
and then i wonder like i don't
necessarily want to
vilify people who vote for trump but at
the same time
you also need to call racism out and i
don't know how
even beyond trump i don't know how we
ever sort of piece this back together
or where are the spaces for these
conversations it's not twitter
no it's certainly not well first of all
i think
the biggest mistake that we have
and it's a trap that gets set by the
right
whether intentionally or unintentionally
is just the frame of asking is blank
racist
that is something that we have to pull
ourselves out of
it's not about asking whether trump
voters are racist
we need to talk about racism not
racists yeah racists it's a very
two-dimensional
boring conversation is something racist
yes or no
and then you debate what do you do what
do you do about that we need to talk
about
racism its contours its histories
where it manifests how it's used because
like all winning political phenomena
whether they're good or bad in your
opinion they rely on coalition building
so trump relied on a coalition and a
core part of that coalition
were racists building a coalition
with all sorts of other people
that could be susceptible to
racist views if they were blanketed and
layered and
made people feel good about it not being
a racist thing
right and so there are a lot of people
who support trump that genuinely don't
believe that they are racist
um because we do not talk about or
educate people on recognizing racism
and because we do not do that um
it it just allows itself to just
we get caught in this debate of is
something racist and then a person uses
their defensiveness
and they say well it's not racist
because i'm not racist and i believe
this thing because it's economic in
nature
right um so i was just listening to a
podcast where some of my
democratic friends who are very smart
have been on winning presidential
campaigns
said that their biggest fear in 2020 is
that we nominate someone who has
taken positions that are not supported
by
a majority of people in states that add
up to 270.
do you think there is anything valid
about that
fear and what do we sort of do about
that fear
yeah i think i tend to think that
people a lot of folks um especially in
dc sometimes misunderstand the average
voter
i think that people think that voters
are more ideological than they are
i think that people think that voters
cast their votes based on
policy positions more than they actually
do
and i think that what is actually
important
is how we message our positions how we
not even defend them how we evangelize
them
how we talk about a vision for our
future
and the only vision for our future that
i think
is winning is an audacious one and
whether you like it or whether you hate
it a wall
is a vision it's a tangible vision
that is symbolic and representative and
galvanizing
and if we do not have an ambitious
inspiring galvanizing vision
i think we risk losing even more
and it's not about you know it and it's
it's all about how you
message these issues that i think is
more important than the actual positions
that people take
um and that i think
has always been the historic weakness of
the democratic party
it's something that we do not have
institutions for
republicans messaging lines i mean you
see you watch fox news
any old schmo that's in the republican
party goes on cnn and says or goes on
fox news
and they'll use the same words the same
terminology their messaging
is completely unified and um
and it's aggressive in winning over the
electorate what
i always wonder why we have this problem
on our side because
a lot of these messages from democrats
are polled
right which is a problem on itself the
polling is not
completely off right like we know that
the polling would probably tell us what
you and i believe which is
some of these economically populous
messages really resonate
somehow though when they say it when the
candidates say it it doesn't
ring true you know i mean you ran a
campaign where
whether someone agreed with you or not
they saw you as authentic and inspiring
and believing in what you were saying
how do you like what advice do you give
your colleagues and friends who are
running in some of these tougher swing
districts well i think
first of all we have to become
master storytellers i think anyone who's
in public service
needs to be a master storyteller it's
not just about being
a legislator we have to be it requires
so many different skills
we have to be legislators we have to be
policy makers
but there's this idea that if you're a
good enough legislator
you should just win re-election because
you're good at your job
but that is clearly not how politics
works we have to be master storytellers
and so my personal advice in terms of
storytelling
is to tell our stories and to make
arguments with your five senses
and not five facts
use facts as supporting evidence but
you need to communicate and tell the
stories in terms of
you know the smells that other people
are smelling the
the stress the
how your heart is beating you we need to
show that we are having the same human
experience
and too often it doesn't come across
that way
because frankly a lot of people aren't
in dc a lot of policy makers aren't
having the same human experience as a
lot of people in the country
and that is what trump has tapped into
the visceral
and i think our politics is our best
when our head and our heart align when
the visceral
also matches with with the
the academic and
and when our facts are not separated or
not that we have this hierarchy
but that they are put together because
um
because emotions are also information
as well and if we i think are
the amount of resentment that happened
in 2016 that i think led to democratic
loss
was the fact that we were telling
implicitly
i feel like we had been telling people
that what they are seeing is not what
is happening and that created a lot of
resentment
and people wanted to punish
those who were doing that and i think
that was an outlet for that
how much do you think sort of our own
history plays a role i i see you do this
a lot which i think is really effective
is
talk about fdr or
you know sort of line up progressive
beliefs with
progressive traditions and american
traditions you know and i i think
obama used to do this a lot and say that
you know patriotism isn't sort of
airbrushed history and wearing a flag
pin
patriotism is the civil rights movement
that's at the core of what this country
has been about
um do you think the democrats do that
well enough do you do it more
i think we need to do it more yeah and
it's not just about recounting
the story right it's about saying this
is who we are
we need our best at our best but this is
also not even just at our best but
it is who we are now too
but we have to tell our story
because america has always been a story
of
people who want of some folks who want
to cling to their own
small vestiges of power and prevent us
from progressing
and those who have been able to
galvanize and bring us together
and move us forward and it's always a
stutter step between those two things
in in that move
towards progress and we need to tell
our story because a huge part of hope
is not just you know hope is an optimism
right
and um it's not it's not just this
naive belief that things will get better
hope is saying this is where we've been
we have already done this we can do this
there's a strategy for doing it
but we need to take a leap and we need
it will only happen if we are courageous
right it will only happen if we take a
risk and there's this
idea that we can win without taking any
risks
and that is not it's just not how the
world works i know one of one other
thing that sort of scares me about
this coming election is you know in a
way
we were able to run by saying you know
the greatest risk you can take is
doing the same thing over and over again
and because
george w bush wasn't going to be
president again there wasn't as much
fear in the electorate and so people
were willing to take a risk on someone
completely new i feel like heading into
2020
the emotion that sort of pervades
everything especially among democrats is
this fear that we're going to lose to
trump again yeah and it's making
a lot of democrats more cautious than
they would be
and i sort of worry that that caution
could lead to a bad plan
i completely agree i mean just from your
gut and it's unfortunate because this is
how authoritarians typically
come into power but
coming from your gut which so many
voters vote on their gut more than
people want to admit
right especially in washington but if
you have two options in front of you
and one is self-assured has a direction
saying this is where i want to go i know
some of you may disagree with me
but i believe that this is my diagnosis
of the country
this is our solution this is how we're
going to move forward
versus another person that's like i
think
this might be what it is but not quite
that but this that and the other
you have a self-assured leader and you
have
a timid one people are going to go
to where they feel a sense of certainty
right just
policy questions aside yeah and so if
you have someone that's constantly
stutter stepping and
back you know backtracking that does not
inspire
confidence in an electorate especially
in a time
as tumultuous as this one and
i think what folks also need to realize
is that this time is not just scary
because donald trump is president
this time is scary this time has been
scary because people don't know if
they're going to be able to pay their
rent at the end of the month
people don't know if when you wake up
if you walk out of your house if god
forbid you get hit by a car
or slip off of a curb if your life is
going to be over because your health
costs are going to be out of control
and that is the uncertainty that people
are actually feeling
and trump is is a huge destabilizing
factor on top of all of that
but at the end of the day a lot of
people are feeling an insane amount of
economic insecurity as well
and it's concentrated in the people that
trump is hurting the most
right and laird on top of all this of
course is
the climate crisis um you know
so you propose the green new deal this
is something that requires
a mass mobilization like we haven't seen
since world war ii
and it requires it urgently and it
requires it at a time when
our political system is in crisis
because one of our parties has
been radicalized how do where do we
begin to make
real progress on this when you know our
best hope is
democratic president 51 senators no
filibuster
and then you're still dealing with like
joe manchin
it's a huge um it's a huge challenge
especially with manchin as
chairman of energy and commerce in the
senate
uh this is where i think a huge amount
of public sentiment comes in
um and when we first introduced the
resolution one of the biggest critiques
that we get
on the left is that it's too much it's
too sweeping
but energy policy is not just about
putting solar panels on everyone's roof
right our
entire system is incentivized to
destroying our planet and the only home
that we live on
and this
is it's so long as
fossil fuels are profitable and so long
as
um low wages are profitable people are
going to be economically marginalized
and feel like a coal mine is their only
hope
and and so
the reason it has to be so sweeping is
because we need to give
our entire economy i think a golden gate
of retreat and decarbonization
and so um so that's
why we have to you know that's why we
have to make
a renewable energy job just as good of a
quality as a coal job
because coal jobs are unionized and
a lot of solar panel jobs are like these
ad hoc
weird hourly or like you have horrible
catastrophic health insurance plans
and that's a lot of the reason why
people don't want to switch over too
and so we need to address a lot of those
underlying economic issues
so and and frankly it's going
the green new deal i think is in many
parts it's also an an economic stimulus
package for main street
you know we had we had no problem
blinking or snapping our fingers and
passing
uh passing the stimulus package which
created a large amount of political
resentment as well because we build out
wall street
and did very little for main street and
you know this
i think is the answer to that is that i
think agreement when people say oh this
is
so expensive well we don't care when
this expense
when these expenses go to bailing out
big banks but for some reason the idea
of billing out
a generation seems unconscionable do you
think that the next president should
prioritize
a green new deal even over
medicare for all like knowing that a
president has
i don't know two major legislative
initiatives before the midterms
well i think scientifically um we
have no choice but to put climate front
and center
um so in terms of that aspect
uh we have to do it but i do think that
in making these massive investments like
if we're going to make a million dollar
if we're going to make millions of jobs
i want those millions of jobs to have
health insurance to have a high quality
and that's why i don't think it's
necessarily either or it's going to say
we're going to make this investment and
these are the requirements that this
investment is funding yeah
um so republicans have already tried to
make you
the face of the democratic party heading
into 2020
it's a curious decision to me i mean i
will tell you that in our wisconsin poll
your net favorability is higher than
most of our presidential candidates
including joe biden um what what do you
think about this how do you
you know do you feel like there's a
added responsibility
because you have been made this
notorious star on the right
i mean i think there's there's certainly
a responsibility
because there's a certain power in that
and so
if they're going to make me the focus
then i get to determine
as a proxy what they focus on and so if
they're going to spend all of their time
trying to trash the green new deal
i think that's great because the green
new deal is enormously popular
or like yesterday in this like little
tiff with barstool sports
if we want to get into a fight and
you're going to be the anti-union side
i will take that any day of the week
please
go on the record bashing unions please
go on the record saying
we shouldn't have health insurance go on
the record saying
this country should only be for white
people and i will
gladly take up that mantle and force
them to be on the defense
because people say oh what like
how risky is this if if a presidential
candidate gets elected or
you know wins the primary on medicare
for all are they going to be too far
left
these other schmoes are literal white
supremacists
and they're not worried about that right
so i mean
come on like this is an outrageous point
to make
um and we have to be as galvanizing as
possible
is one of the reasons you jumped in on
that yesterday because
it's so hard to get coverage of the
labor movement in unions like i noticed
that you
sort of pick your battles on twitter it
seems to me very strategically
thinking that there are some issues that
just never break through in the normal
political conversation
and if you were saying earlier if you
can sort of fuse
the politics with pop culture and what's
interesting
you can sort of get more people to pay
attention yeah i mean that is something
that i enjoy
doing because at my core i come from the
background of community organizing
and in my primary election
i won because i expanded the electorate
68
over the last off-year midterm primary i
talk to people who don't vote
that's my jam i talk to young people i
talk to people of color
i talk to working-class people that say
why should i
consent to be governed by the lesser of
two evils
this system doesn't work for me you know
i think one of the biggest
misconceptions that we have in politics
is that
people who don't vote are apathetic and
if anything sometimes i find them to be
the most passionate about politics
and they're just very heartbroken and
dejected how do you how do you overcome
that
cynicism about the system that i think i
i understand it i mean i've talked to
these
a lot of these non-voters too and
democrats say these should be our voters
they're younger they're predominantly
people of color
they're poorer and then you know some of
the solution is like well
we can get there by just sort of
proposing more ambitious policies
but it seems like there's something
deeper going on the only way
you are going to get those voters is by
actually telling the truth
yeah and do you try to set expectations
with them like
i'm gonna go fight for you but by the
way because one of the one of the
worries i had when
the democrats won the house is there's
gonna be a lot of expectation from
people who don't pay
super close attention to politics that
democrats won the house
now everything's gonna be great yeah and
we only control one house of congress so
we can't promise that much but is that
gonna create more disappointment well
i don't i when i go back home it's
not about winning it's about fighting
and every time i come home people say
thank you for
trying thank you for fighting for us
that's the number one thing that i hear
when i go back home and it's because
they know it's not
i come from a district that is like d
plus 24
or something like that
people vote for in my community vote for
democrats no matter what
but they don't like democrats you know
it's not
they don't love the party and i think
that's the mistake that people
that we have we take we take young
people for granted we take communities
of color for granted we take
working-class people for granted and we
just say oh well you're going to vote
for us no matter what because we're the
lesser of two evils right so like you
should there's this entitlement
that's like it's your fault you don't
vote it's your fault that you don't vote
and if you only voted
we would pass all of these things for
you that's
that's yeah and that's why i
unseated a 20-year incumbent
that was the fourth most powerful person
in the party and the argument that i
made
people you know some people were saying
oh well he's going to be the next
speaker
um do we really want to give up that
power to our district and i said
how much of that power has been used to
improve our lives
yeah how much of it and i think that's
when people
were saying you know what we should have
a change
yeah and i i don't always understand it
because like
i think politicians and and people
who've been in washington for a long
time
believe that people who are disengaged
from politics
like they believe that everyone pays as
closely attention to politics as we all
do
and so if they don't automatically know
that donald trump is the worst person on
earth
they don't automatically know that
voting for a democrat
is the best thing to do then it's their
problem
and i think we don't realize that people
are busy and living their lives and
there's a certain obligation that comes
with citizenship but there's also an
obligation
on behalf of our leaders well not only
that but
deep in that message that you're talking
about where it's like oh well you should
know that if you don't vote trump will
win
right what you're saying and well what
people say what that argument says
is you should vote for us for your
survival
right we don't tell
white folks in the midwest that right
it's like
we tell communities of color the other
side will kill you
and we won't right so isn't that an
inspiring message to get to the polls
right and so how why is it a surprise
that young people don't vote that
that working-class communities don't
vote why is it a surprise that
that the union vote did not turn out in
2016
because none of these message were
messages were galvanizing
and you know i think that we could have
permanent majorities if we told the
truth and fought for people and actually
took a risk
and i think the reason people appreciate
even if they disagree with
me i hear this a lot from even
republicans that i talk to that say you
know i may not agree with you but i
respect you
is because they know that i am not
it's not a show like they know that i am
legitimately risking things
to make people's lives better and i
think that that's what a public servant
has to do
and it's not i think that's what all
public servants have to do regardless of
your party
you it is a service we have to risk
and sacrifice the real things of
ourselves not
pretend things and um
and i think that that's that is what is
winning and i think in terms of that
ethos
people vote for ethos's as well they
vote for vision
and ethos and in how their communities
are
are galvanizing in a moment i think that
was a huge reason why bernie sanders was
was successful in 2016. because no one
had ever heard of medicare for all
and tuition-free colleges like those
were i think we underestimate how much
these policies were put into the map and
how they've become
mainstream in such a short period of
time
well and it wasn't just his policies too
i always remember thinking back to
bernie's announcement speech in 2016 and
the very first line of the speech is
just
i believe we need a political and
economic revolution and she's like oh
you know what his worldview is
i saw you talking uh when you spoke to
david remnick about
sort of trying to understand different
candidates world views and how important
that is
yes what do you believe is the world
view
that succeeds in 2020
well i think the world view
it's you know and this is also very much
from
from obama's practice and marshall gans
too you have to tell the story
of me us and now and
that story of me us and now should
coincide
you know the world view is the diagnosis
after telling those three stories
and so i think the world view right now
is that
and i think a lot of candidates have
kind of gotten this but i don't know if
they're getting it just because it pulls
well
or if because or because they've deeply
internalized the reality of america
today
and it's that our system and
our politics our structure
is is designed to help
the powerful and we do
need to have these huge changes we do
need a political and economic revolution
but
we we are at a crossroads right now and
the crossroads and i think we have to
tell the story of the crossroads
where our nation
is coming apart and it will continue to
come apart
or we can use this moment as an
opportunity
to transform but there is no going back
to where we were right and i think that
is the bitter pill
that is very hard for a lot of people to
swallow
but the america that we had
even under obama is gone right
and it's it that is that is the nature
of time
you know the america that we had with
obama
the america of george bush was forever
gone right
and we have to decide how we're going to
transform
but there is no staying the same anymore
and
and taking that step forward requires a
certain level of courage and ambition
but that's always been the way it was
right and
as i think as humanity evolves
we can always evolve for the better and
i think we're almost scared
of living in a more advanced world
because i think that
in ed we have to we the way we advance
as a society
a more advanced society is one where
everyone can go to the doctor
a more advanced society is one where
every person
has the opportunity to educate
themselves as
far as they see fit for their own lives
that you know it sounds like science
fiction to a lot of people but science
fiction is written
for the societies we're going to live in
decades from now
and that
these policies are the ones that are
policies of an advanced society
so we're going to have to decide if
we're going to be a regressive society
because we're used to it
because we're used to barbarism and
we're used to 300
insulin and we think that not having 300
insulin is quote unquote unrealistic
or we can actually realize that reality
is what we create and that we have
all of the money to do all of these
things we just have to
decide that this is going to be our
value as a country congresswoman thank
you so much
for joining us this is great absolutely
thank you for having me
you
