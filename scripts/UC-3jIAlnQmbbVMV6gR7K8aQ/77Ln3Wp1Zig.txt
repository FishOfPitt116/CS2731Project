we are back
sam cedar on the majority report on the
phone
is a pleasure to welcome to the program
professor of political science at george
washington university
co-author with michael tessler and lynn
vavrek
of identity crisis the 2016 presidential
campaign and the battle for the meaning
of america
john sides welcome to the program thank
you so much for having me
so let's start um the this story
of uh the of the 2016 election really
starts
uh closer to 2008 and
um i i want to just start with one uh
fact
that i just did sort of blew me away was
that less than
50 percent of of non-college
educated white voters could could
place the democrats to the left of the
republicans
on the question of which party was
more supportive of government assistance
i guess broadly
help for americans is is that right and
what what are the implications of that
at that time what that's showing you is
of course that
that lots of people just don't pay close
attention to politics
and don't register features of
political parties that to most political
observers are well known and
have been well known for years if not
decades
the reason that this changes though has
to do with the presidency of barack
obama
and in some sense barack obama clarifies
the party politics of race and this
helps voters
who may have been paying less attention
to politics
come to realize that the democratic
party is to the left of the republican
party on these issues
that to me is stunning because there was
plenty of uh there i mean i've seen
uh studies that suggest that um
i guess the the idea of like of
um of government support becomes
racialized right before this but it's
not
lined up with with the parties until
essentially people see that a black eye
is the democratic nominee
yeah there for especially for voters who
had less formal education um the
alignment of their partisanship and
their racial attitudes really was
a feature of the obama era and what that
did
of course overall was just to strengthen
the correlation in the american
population more generally so that people
who have views of immigration that are
more favorable
or want more immigration or people that
have views of racial inequality that
think that it has mostly to do with
slavery and discrimination those people
are increasingly democrats and if you
have
a view that is more concerned about the
level of immigration wants to reduce it
or if you have a view of racial
inequality that says that it's
mostly about blacks not trying hard
enough or not working hard enough
then those people are increasingly
republicans
you know so maybe the partis maybe
people are changing their views about
immigration to match their partisanship
or maybe they're
updating their partisanship to align
with their views of race and integration
but either way
you know we end up with a country where
the standard way that we can test
elections you know democrat versus
republican
is now not just a debate about let's say
how large government should be which it
has been for years and years and years
now it's a debate about
you know what kind of country we're
going to be how exclusive or inclusive
we're going to be toward these different
kinds of groups
and i mean in some ways like i feel that
um
some of us here i'm speaking literally
in this room
i have been uh guilty of assuming
that um these things were already
racialized
right i mean to because race has played
such an enormous
um part in our politics
but i guess so so the big difference is
really just sort of
this this new level of sorting that
that's taking place right that that has
been
really a basically an eight to ten year
process
that's absolutely right i mean there's
no question that
racial politics have been endemic in
american politics from the founding
but the ways in which people's views
about race and their own racial
identities align with partisanship
is a much more recent phenomenon
and even even like in the context of
like the dixiecrats and whatnot
and lbj saying we're gonna lose the
south because of these issues uh for
for a decade he turned out to be a
little bit a little bit off
uh but um but even then i mean this is
uh so it all comes down
let's let's just start with this i mean
where where do you guys
what tell us about the research that you
did that you started to
come across this notion did you enter
into this
work with with an awareness that
this dynamic had taken place yes i mean
in part because my co-author michael
tesler
um had previously written two different
books about the politics of race
um during the obama era one about his
2008 presidential campaign
and then a second book about um his
not only his presidential campaigns but
his presidency more generally
and we knew this was happening and there
are some you know there's
been a lot of attention in the political
science literature
to this concept of sorting into the ways
in which
democrats and republicans inc you know
may increasingly differ from each other
on a variety of policy issues
but what michael was able to show in his
work on the obama era was that this
sorting came to encompass
racial issues as well as more general
kinds of ideological issues
however i think that this
more general trend towards sorting may
or may not have been
as consequential in 2016 had it not been
for the 2016 campaign itself i mean
there was plenty of sorting already
underway
by the 2012 but yet the role of issues
like immigration and race in 2016 was
clearly greater than in 2012 or that's
what our evidence suggests and that
tells you that
a lot of it had to do with the specific
choices of the
candidates in terms of their ideas and
messages in 2016
and how it was different from other
recent presidential elections
okay so conceptually to understand this
it's almost as if there was like a
there was something uh like like a like
a dormant um
i don't know uh virus uh embedded in all
of us
and the environment in 2012 or 2008
um brought that to the fore
and and then um in 2012 it was a little
bit less
the environment was a little bit less
stimulating to that virus and then in
2016
that virus or uh allergy or however you
want to conceptualize it
what was even magnified because of
of the context is that sort of like
conceptually
the right eye way to think about that i
think that's right i mean sometimes we
talk about it with kind of an
agricultural metaphor which is
um you know aspects of the obama era
kind of fertilized
the soil for more racially charged
politics
and the that made the
probably increase the likelihood that
that kind of racially charged politics
could be potent
if the candidates were to really embrace
that
and obama obviously didn't he was always
trying to
moderate on questions of race he didn't
talk about it as frequently as some
other democratic presidents he took very
careful positions
you know mccain and romney you know
really did not want to run heavily
racialized campaigns and you know
explicitly rejected certain kinds of
tactics that might have played the race
card
in a more explicit way um but of course
for trump and clinton it was a very
different kind of election altogether
all right well let's i mean let's talk
about that in terms of you know because
uh my understanding is that
clinton found herself relative from 2008
to 2016
the way that she was perceived on race
and as reflected in her
supporters um almost flipped
is that right yes basically of course in
2008
you know her coalition was built around
primarily um white voters in the
democratic primaries and especially
white voters who had
more conservative views on racial issues
and in 2016
it flips that now her coalition she
actually she gains all the support among
african-americans
loses some support among whites overall
and the role of white
primary voters racial attitudes just
doesn't really matter as much anymore
because there's no african-american
candidate on the ballot and and clinton
and sanders are not really
different on their in their own views um
about
about racial inequality so yeah it was
basically
a a coalition that became the inverse of
itself
so how do you measure this stuff i mean
how i mean because 2008
you know it's not um we had our first
black presidential candidate we also
were coming out of
uh or entering into you know the most
severe
uh economic um uh
uh i guess event in
generations um how do you how do you
sort of parse this stuff out like how do
you determine
what is operative what is because i
imagine there's a lot of things that go
into
you know the question of who am i going
to vote for
how do you parse these out and how do
you determine what is the sort of the
driving factor
sure what we did
in looking at the 2016 election
um was we we did as many comparisons
to recent presidential elections as we
could because we wanted to distinguish
what is distinctive about 2016
from what is kind of a chronically
important factor in presidential
elections
in which case if it's chronically
important then the story isn't really
about 2016
it's just a broader story about american
presidential elections
one of the ways that we did this was
with us a unique survey that interviewed
the same group of voters first in the
2012 election we talked to them in
december 2011 so
you know almost a year before they voted
we talked to them in november 2012
after they had voted we asked them you
know did you vote obama did you mitt
romney
and then four years later right after
the 2016 election we were able to
reinterview those same voters and so we
could see
you know how they voted in both
elections and who shifted from obama to
trump or from
romney to clinton and we could compare
the relative
impact of their views about a variety of
different issues that we had measured
way back in 2011
you know well before you know both
campaigns but especially 2016.
and we found that it was these things
about race and immigration that
that although in some cases they
certainly
appeared to correlate strongly with your
choice from between obama and romney
that those correlations
increased in 2016 other factors didn't
necessarily share that same pattern
how do you like i mean what are the type
of questions that you ask to
to make that determination where you
pull it apart very good question very
good question so like let's we can break
up
um a couple different topics take
racial inequality you know we're asking
people whether they agree or disagree
with a series of statements
and the statements are designed to get
at do you attribute racial inequality to
structural forces like discrimination or
do you attribute it to the fact that
you know to your belief that blacks
don't work hard enough
so you might generations of slavery and
discrimination have made it difficult
for blacks to get ahead that's you know
do you agree or disagree or you may ask
them
um it's just a question of trying harder
if blacks when we try hard enough they
could be as well off as whites
do you agree or disagree so we asked
those kinds of questions to measure
views of immigration you know it's in
the three questions that we we had in
the survey when we
first did it in 2011 where do you want
to increase or decrease immigration do
you want to or keep it the same you know
and then do you support a path of
citizenship for undocumented immigrants
and then
thirdly do you think that undocumented
immigrants are
um benefit or drain on society so you
know you know we combine these questions
together to get you know kind of indexes
or scales that measure people's views on
these issues
to do one more example where there's a
lot of discussion about the role of
economics and economic anxiety
and so in both 12 and 16 this is now in
a different survey project but
a really nice battery of questions how
worried are you about losing your job
how likely is it that you're not going
to be able to make a mortgage or writ
payment in the coming months or not be
able to make a health care payment
um several questions of that nature so
really designed to get it
the the what i think people really
thought were the the
driving insecurities even after eight
years of economic recovery since the
recession
and we just found that those economic
anxiety measures really
didn't strongly correlate with your vote
in either election 12 or 16 and didn't
correlate more strongly in 16 than 12.
do you were there significant
differences
in the way that people answered those
questions so you're asking the same
people in 2011
uh that you are in uh 2016
um are do do their answers
change at all i mean did you see any
like did people become
more or less um express more or less i
guess racist views or
you know however you want a very good
question overall no
um there aren't really big shifts
in in people's overall views about
immigration or race or things like that
one of the metaphors that we use to
illustrate this sometimes people talk
about
trump's victory or the success of
right-wing populist parties and
european countries as a wave it's
reflecting it's a wave of populist
sentiment but if you if by populist
sentiment you mean
things like concern about immigration
you know there is no wave
it's not that like the public was
becoming less
open to immigration and that's what
trump was able
to ride to victory what we would say is
that
public opinion on questions like race
and immigration and other issues is
really more like a reservoir
you know there's a there's a range of
sentiments from positive to negative or
favorable to unfavorable
and the question is are those sentiments
going to be mobilized
uh and therefore become more powerfully
predictive of people's choices and again
that's where the that's where the
decisions of the candidates come in
so it's in in let me ask the same
question about the economic uh
the economic anxiety measures was there
any movement from
from 2011 to 2016 um
yeah the american public became less
economically anxious
which again i is it's a mystery to me
why this was so
undercovered going into the 2016
election but
um there have been you know 50 years of
survey data that asked people things
like you know how are your personal
finances doing are they getting better
or worse
what about the national economy do you
think it's getting better or worse what
about
in a year from now do you think you'll
be better than or worse off then
you know the the standard battery of
questions
showed pretty clearly that the public
was getting
more economically confident and again
this is just tracking the actual risk
the recovery from the recession um it's
not to suggest that like every problem
had been
solved right but in terms of what the
public was seeing
it clearly reflected a belief that the
economy was getting better and what's
remarkable to me is that since trump's
gotten elected
there's much more news coverage now
about the economic recovery the growth
rate the unemployment rate
people with positive views now the
question is
why isn't the positive economy helping
trump or helping the republican party
but if you look at people's actual
views about the economy they're only a
little bit better than they were in
2016.
so again we i think in some sense the
popular impression
of the campaign really missed the boat
on what was happening
in in public opinion overall and and and
was that
um sort of uh you know i guess uh
improved perspective on the economy
um was that equally distributed
across um you know
different uh income levels and
wealth levels and all different sort of
subgroups that you would you would look
at very good question
so the answer is yes that you can
you can segment the public based on
how much formal education they have you
can segment them based on their income
level
and the trends are moving in parallel so
like every group every educational group
and income group is becoming more
favorable about the economy
and in fact the ironic thing about the
the comparisons across the income groups
is that during the obama years
there were actually fewer differences
between the wealthiest and the least
wealthy americans
and their views of the economy so in
some sense the
the income differences shrank during
obama
far from it being at the case that they
were growing because
the wealthy people thought the economy
was doing much better but the poor
people thought it wasn't
um the only really thing that
differentiates people's
perceptions of the economy overall is
just partisanship
and you know democrats and democratic
leaning
people were much more likely to perceive
that economic growth in republicans
because the republicans didn't want to
give credit to a democratic president
and this kind of partisan bias and
economic perceptions is a pretty chronic
feature of contemporary american
politics so
if you wanted to find the really angry
people or the so-called economically
anxious people
it was really republicans tired of being
out of the white house for eight years
you know it wasn't
due to social class or income or
anything like that
and in much your research suggests that
that that that race or that
party becomes a surrogate for racial uh
questions is that right i mean is that
is that is that
is it yes okay so yeah we uh so so
explain
that to us the party becomes a surrogate
for
for the yeah the race racial views that
that you have that like the more things
become racialized i mean
it's just even getting back to the
immigration uh point you were making
people had the same feelings towards
immigration
it's just that they didn't realize they
could
express them in like the political
arena like is that is that like a way of
conceiving
i would i may maybe put it slightly
differently i mean
they express them i mean they'll tell
you their views i mean release if you
believe survey data
but again like but you can't act on them
you can actually act on them within the
context of politics and they didn't
understand that before
well i mean i think what they what from
from from the standpoint of social
science right
if there's a lot of different
ingredients that can go into my choice
between a democratic and republican
candidate
and we we know that partisanship is
always going to be a factor
and it's been it was a strong factor in
2016 as it has been in previous
elections but the question is
are other factors well it depends right
it depends on
first of all what are the candidates
talking about are you getting enough
information
to think that this is an important issue
what positions are the candidates taking
if they're taking the same position then
it doesn't really help you choose
to think about that issue because
they're not you know they're carbon
copies of each other
so again what i think makes a difference
for voters is to see first of all a lot
of discussion about an issue which
brings it to the top of your head and
makes it a more
salient part of your thinking and then
to see the candidates
sharply differ on that question
and so what you saw in 2016 that was
different than 2012 or 2008 was
both this extraordinary emphasis
on all of these issues tied to race
ethnicity and immigration
and also very very sharp differences
between trump's
positions of course which attracted
controversy for the entire duration of
the campaign
and clinton's positions which we argue
were to the left of obama's probably
and more generally of course she was
structuring her entire campaign
in many ways as a rejection of trump and
so
i think if you were a voter now you had
a very clear contrast
on an issue that was being discussed
more frequently than it had been so
that's what makes
your own views about immigration now
become activated and
a more more important influence on your
choice
i see so um as i grow older i may think
that um
you know tax deductions for mortgages on
homes are more important than i did when
i was
you know 22 i guess but
uh in this instance it is outside of me
that remains a constant and suddenly uh
the candidates are talking about tax
deductions
on home mortgages and how important they
are and i may be
become more attuned to it at an earlier
age just
for example yeah and it it and it's not
to say that that
people don't make choices based on
factors that
are um you know kind of intrinsic or
idiosyncratic to them
right um i certainly i certainly also
care a lot more about the mortgage
interest deduction than i did 20 years
ago
um but and it's not to say that we can
reduce
people's choices in 2016 or any election
to one factor or one set of factors
um but what what i would typically say
again is if we want to see what
what is distinctively important um about
voting behavior in one election as
opposed to other elections a lot of
that's going to depend on the
the the choices and the messages of the
candidate
and so and this is uh and this was one
of those things that was different than
the other
essentially is what what stuck out and
so
