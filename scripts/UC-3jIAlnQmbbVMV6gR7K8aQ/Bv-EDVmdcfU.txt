uh
but let's start with uh ben shapiro
one of america's leading intellectual
lights
as people always say with ben shapiro or
people don't always say this i think
increasingly people are not saying this
thankfully but there was a period of
time where he was in the
even if you know you disagree you gotta
admit he's smart
category um who was saying that
well i think like the new york times
when they called him a cool kids
philosopher
as an example let's watch because the
new york times knows so much about being
cool
new york times is really at the cutting
edge
of cool let's watch ben shapiro
philosophizing he has on a guest
uh uh codepink national director
arielle gold there's a lot going on here
including i think a little bit of um
permits for feelings it's for feelings
i'm not sure i don't want to impute
anything but
you're saying he's afraid of girls i'm
saying that ben shapiro's a little
rattled by a lot of elements of this
exchange
and uh like matt made the point before
the show this is also a good example
if you keep your cool and you present it
well which she does
how to sort of knock somebody like this
off of their game
especially within tight parameters on a
cable news segment let's check this out
canceling classes for the students
thankful that we live in a country that
still values dissent
and protest that's much more than we can
say right now
for the apartheid state of israel whoa
not sure where that came
from and um that's a lie but
i think we'll save that live for another
time since we actually have other topics
to get to suffice to say that muslims in
israel have more rights than muslims any
place
in the middle east by a long shot so he
has to trot out that old chestnut that
we hear
all the time now if we're being real
and what people including two former
prime ministers have they put different
timelines on it but everybody
acknowledges
ehud barack ehud olmert and so on that
obviously
israel controls gaza and the west bank
the west bank is an apartheid situation
with a security perimeter and complete
control of palestinian movement
in outside of the west bank which is
very narrow piece of territory
and in gaza palestinians are
regularly murdered for
engaging in non-violent protests inside
israel
there's just been a new law to sort of
formally codify
israel as an ethno state in a very
apartheid-like fashion but i guess
if what you want to hang on is that
within 67 borders
israeli arabs are treated better than
they might be
in saudi arabia if that's your big
claim to success and democracy
i go for it but i'm actually going to
say
as a left half jew we could do a lot
better than that
benny uh but i enjoyed the way she
injected that that was a lot of fun
i wish you would have said suffice it to
say we could do a lot better than that
right exactly
