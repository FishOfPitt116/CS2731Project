michael brooks uh what is it is that an
adidas outfit that you're wearing or no
uh
well the jacket is from adidas okay and
the uh shirt is not
right i don't understand actually i need
to the my friend justin sent me a whole
box of these from this company in la so
i'll get you the name of this
t-shirt company soon great that sounds
great it is i want to
obviously fast track that no i'm sure
that is going to be promoted
um indeed uh jamie is here obviously and
brendan is here as well michael i mean
matt is out uh for the day
um we've got a bunch of stuff to cover
the
um the administrative assault
on our government continues by the trump
administration we'll go over a couple of
those things that we had mentioned
in headlines over the past couple of
days
uh i want to go a little bit further in
depth into the
the new uh public charge
laws but you know i i want to talk about
this first because
i was on the um uh hear the burn
podcast a couple weeks ago and
um was talking about
the the presses
the press or you know in general and
um but specifically in terms of the
coverage of bernie sanders and we don't
go through this too much on this program
because
um i think there's broadly a a fairly
um sophisticated
if you've if you've made your way to
this program
you already have a fairly jaded
perspective i think of
of the of the corporate news and if
you've been listening to this program
you know since its inception on air
america then you certainly
you certainly do um and and it's and
it's warranted
um we never dug up the name of that uh
reporter from politico
uh michael who called and i and i tell
the story now almost weekly
it feels like of when a political
reporter called
in the spring of 2015 because he was
doing a story on martin o'malley
and he the way he said it to me martin
o'malley wants to know how he can
he can get progressive support away from
elizabeth warren i was like elizabeth
warren she's not running
he's got to worry about bernie sanders
and the guy just laughed laughed laughed
laughed and laughed
literally laughed and i'm like i'm i'm
being
i'm being serious um
let me just double check that name yeah
let me double check that name but
but i mean and it's largely irrelevant
who the na who the guy
specifically was because this is the
mentality
that the largely largely
hashtag not all reporters and
journalists
have towards bernie sanders and and more
broadly
toward the left
but also i think
there there's a something there's a
specific quality that they have a
problem with
because when i think back to the dean
campaign
howard dean he was uh perceived in many
respects as
the the leftist the the most left of
that
uh of that 2004 primary
field but i'm not quite sure that that's
an accurate assessment of his politics
and he was governor of vermont
he was a fairly conservative
i don't say conservative but but within
the in the context of the democratic
party
a conservative uh when it came to uh
many issues
in in vermont but he happened to be
anti-war
but the other element of the dean
campaign was that he was one of the
first candidates
to harness what what was at that time
a nascent online presence
we didn't have social media nearly in
the way i don't even think we had the
term social media per se
except for in academic circles at this
point you know my space may have been
around but i don't think people
perceived it that way
facebook wasn't particularly ubiquitous
but there was a lot of internet based
organizing and there was a lot of small
donors in fact that was one of the first
as far as i can tell real big small
donor campaigns that use the internet in
fact it was probably the the first of
the big
that use the internet and there was a
resent
by the press to the inclusion
of a lot of newbies essentially
and a lot of activists
who did not have the pedigree
that they had and by the pedigree i
don't even necessarily mean education or
uh aristocratic background it really is
just sort of like
there was a lot of resent towards people
who
were smart and dedicated
and excited oh i remember my friend's
mom
had some kind of chocolate dessert party
for howard dean
right i mean there was but beyond that
i'm talking specifically about the
people that they had to bump up against
people who were challenging their
their particular story in narrative that
they wanted to tell
about politics and was that primarily
iraq as the fulcrum at that point
well i mean it was a rock but it was
broader it was a much broader uh
palette of things i mean that's what
that's what brought well
just the whole notion of politics
understand with the blogs was the first
time that people in the media
had their voices questioned in any
fashion whatsoever
because for years they had the ability
to go on cable television
and they can't hear people yelling at
the tv and other people can't hear
individuals yelling at the tv they had
the ability to write stuff
and the only way to rebut what a
reporter would write
at that point and remember the left had
no mass media air america was the the
first
the first even vague taste of criticism
that these media reporters got from the
left
that was in any way
um organized
and then all of a sudden these blogs
show up and people get really offended
hey wait a second you're questioning my
and they're getting embarrassed
and they don't like it and they don't
like it
and there is still remains although
to a certain extent it's diminished
without doubt
this divide and there is a resent of
bernie not just i think because of his
politics although i think there is
there is a
there is a um there's probably a
connection between his politics
and the sort of the nature of the
political movement around him
that that irks them and certainly in
2016
uh there was a lot of bernie sanders um
uh supporters
who could be obnoxious online and who
were difficult
that that that comes with the territory
we're all adults here
right and uh was there a candidate who
didn't have some difficult supporters
well i i mean uh martin o'malley and so
um so
anyways the the point is
that there is already this sort of
low-grade hostility and
and look let's be honest you can look at
the reporters and see where you know
what
who's get where the hostility comes from
there's a
there is a class element to this
and there is a uh insider outsider
element to this
and there's a lot of overlap in those
groups but uh
so here is a um a story from brian
williams
on the 11th hour and there's two aspects
of this it's coming out of
let's play the clips of bernie sanders
talking about amazon
and washington post because
bernie sanders has been saying has been
talking about the
the the coverage and the nature of the
questions that he's getting
which are all we saw this during the
debates and he wasn't certainly the only
person who made this complaint during
the debates
he just did it in a way that gets more
attention maybe
but we saw this in the debates which is
that the framing of these questions
are being framed from a right-wing
perspective
if i ask about immigration i there's
there's four different ways
that there's 20 different ways that i
can ask
about um the same issue of immigration
but ask it in ways that are
leading in one direction or another
and certainly if it's up to me i'm going
to lead
in a way that is a framed by the left
and i imagine if sean hannity is doing
it he's going to lead by a frame of the
right
but when you're doing a debate
with democrats
what is the point
it's for democrats to figure out who
they want to vote for
what is the point for boxing them in on
a republican
frame unless you are already taking this
uh this primary to the general election
as a reporter because they don't do it
on the right i mean it's just simply
they don't
um and what we'll see it whether it's in
the questions of abortion
or the question of i mean
well we won't see these debates this
time around but we've seen it in the
past
so here's bernie sanders making
he's not broadly attacking the media he
is specifically criticizing
the type of coverage he's getting and
the nature of the coverage
which reporters which which politicians
like i said there was multiple people
who said this who made these comments
during the debates
but here he is and he ties bezos into
this but listen carefully because he's
being accused
of creating some type of conspiracy as
if jeff bezos calls up people in the uh
office and says you know don't do this
anybody here know how much amazon
paid in taxes last year so you know i
talk about that all of the time
and then i wonder why the washington
post which is owned by
jeff bezos who owns amazon doesn't write
particularly good articles about me i
don't know why
we have pointed out over and over again
that amazon made 10 billion dollars in
profit last year
you know how much they paid in taxes
they got it zero
any wonder why the washington post is
not one of my great supporters i wonder
why
new york times not much better nothing
now so that's that's basically the
evidence that bernie sanders is peddling
some type of conspiracy theory
here is a coverage of that on uh
with brian williams was this last night
okay
and uh he's got two reporters on one is
um costa from the washington post
um and the other one who is
and then the other one is wall street
journal uh reporter
um here is uh
brian williams caught my attention from
the uh political twitter site called the
horoscope okay first he's going to start
first he's going to start with a
with a uh a tweet from the political
twitter
site of the horse whisperer yeah um
prominent
yeah uh website twitter.com horse
whisperer
this is this is uh the the
closet whisperer king sweet my attention
from the uh political twitter site
called the
horse whisperer okay since this is
trending here's my bernie story
the year was 2016 and bernie was already
long eliminated from contention
an actual democrat would have stopped
torpedoing the nominee
and worked to defeat trump but bernie
had books to sell
the end that kind of nicely sums up how
some democrats feel about bernie when
they hear
using it all right let's just stop there
for a moment
so that that that summarizes how some
democrats
perceive what bernie did and that is
accurate some democrats
do perceive bernie as having done that
who are those democrats well since
brian williams used the horse whisperer
to
represent them let's look and see who
the horse whisperer is
turns out the horse whisperer is a
marketing guy
who has worked with exxon aetna citibank
uh click on the right there this is a
list of
his linkedin he is a senior strategy
consultant independent
consultant to leading agencies and
clients clients include american express
gillette directv l'oreal exxon
genotech merck eli lilly those are
pharmaceutical companies cisco verizon
a t t-mobile old navy
time inc etc so he's definitely a
hillary clinton democrat well
i don't know if he's a hillary clinton
democrat or not the point is
he is a corporate he
is from the corporate sector now
led the growth efforts for u.s offices
the international integrated
agency network in this role was
responsibility of cultivating
relationships proposing marketing
strategies and programs from major
marketers including aetna
citibank bristol myers numerous others
now i'm not suggesting
that aetna or citibank
or exxon or any other of these major
corporations
told the horse risk whisperer to tweet
like that
okay because this dynamic in this
relationship is really important
i don't believe that aetna at
t exxon bristol myers
eli lilly whatever other drug companies
he worked for
you know the ones he's not mentioning
because he thinks those might be
problematic
the military is the military that's the
number i've heard yeah
i'm not suggesting that any of those
companies told him to tweet that
no what i am suggesting is that
the reason why they hire a guy like that
is because
he's a guy who would tweet like that and
this is an important dynamic to keep in
mind here let's continue that
trump talking point um what is the state
of the sanders campaign
as you know it well the sanders campaign
is very
frustrated right now with coverage and
they're not
alone democrats republicans politicians
generally
start to blame the media when they don't
like coverage what is new and what is
sort of a trump-like
attack line is tying the washington post
to amazon with no you know he has no
evidence here and we saw him tone this
down a little bit but
we saw marty baron come back and say
this is a conspiracy theory
but the bernie sanders campaign right
now he is pulling in second or third
he's doing a lot better than
21 22 people in that field but he is not
moving
up he's been sort of stagnant and so he
needs to
expand his support and he is frustrated
about coverage that points out
that he is not you know he's number two
but joe biden is still certainly in the
lead and he is competing with people
like elizabeth warren
who has a lot of very similar ideas but
her polling
is going upwards so while sanders is
stagnant his campaign is frustrated by
coverage that they view is not talking
about all of the great things he's doing
and all of the support he has which he
certainly does have support he's got
lots of donors
he's got grassroots support but
political campaigns
want to talk about the good and not any
of the bad so
robert costa when general electric owned
this building and this network
i was it coincided with the birth of the
uh
the interwebs and a lot of conspiracy
theorists had us all on a
conference call every morning with jack
welch so we'd have the talking points
from the
electric power division the nuclear
division uh the
electric trains all of that of course it
was never true
and i ask you just to show our homework
when was the last time you met or heard
from jeff bezos about your coverage
pause it now
i will tell you this that in 2004
i knew a an msnbc contributor
who was
very very explicit i could we couldn't
talk about it at the time
but bob wright
who was the nbc executive
ceo and then the chairman
and ceo until about 2007
bob wright spoke to jack welsh
and bob wright spoke to all the people
at ge who were the number one
manufacturer weapons manufacturer in
this country
who owned over 51 of
nbc and i know for a fact
that in the run-up to the war they
certainly got calls
about people saying certain things on
the network
and putting frank luntz out there to do
stuff so
ryan williams might be right that jack
welsh never called him
but why would jack walsh call brian
williams why wouldn't jack walsh call
brian williams boss
and say hey now my bet is
that never had to happen because in the
same way that aetna
and exxon and eli lilly don't have to
tell the guy who works for them and does
marketing
hey you should be critical of
the political candidate who wants to
take away our power
you don't have to say that to him
because the reason why you hired him
was because you don't have to say that
to him
so when bernie sanders says
that the washington post comes after him
and cites the relationship they have
with amazon and the
one of the richest individuals in the
country
with a corporation that pays no taxes
the issue isn't that
jeff bezos calls up the washington post
and says hey
i need you guys to tow my line
when jeff bezos buys the washington post
he does so because it's a paper that
tows his line
that doesn't mean every reporter there
but when decisions are made and we know
how
it went down at the times when decisions
are made to put coverage
on bernie sanders and when decisions are
made to ask
questions of the stable of people who
are there the least sympathetic
are appointed which does not happen
does not happen on uh
across the board with candidates
look this is controversial in the
context of book reviews
and people are able to say hey wait a
second
why are you having someone who doesn't
know anything about this topic review
that book
or why are you having someone who has a
problem because uh
his wife left him uh to go with uh this
guy's brother
you know review this book that happens
all the time when people talk about that
there's no conspiracy theories
people say this is this is a bad
editorial assessment
jeff bezos buys this paper
and if he doesn't feel like he has to
interfere it's because
he's happy with what it's doing for him
and his interests i would just like to
add i think another thing in may i'm not
sure we have time to play this chomsky
clip but it really speaks to it that
another thing that's very reflective and
i could speak
in personal conversations with some
journalists but actually also people
who do uh marketing jobs like the horse
whisperer gentlemen
that they are so into this
unacknowledged ideology
that they actually have they're they're
being very sincere that they think that
bernie's being conspiratorial because
they're so deep in that thought process
that they think that any even noting of
it
is conspiracy if that makes sense like
they can't
they can't they're not even
disingenuously putting it off
they cannot even understand the
distinction how stupid
to financially support
a a major publication
that would be critical of it and they of
his interest and they understand that in
every other field of life because it's
intuitive and obvious but when it comes
to them they're
so regimented that they don't think so
all right
we're gonna get to let's get let's do
the chomsky clip in a second but i gotta
just um
i gotta take a break i mean because
liquid iv has told me to say all of this
staying properly properly hydrated one
of the most important factors during hot
summer months
liquid iv the fastest most efficient way
to stay hydrated
uh we fight for it when oh we still have
some in that box up there

got her
doing some exercise over the course of
the summer that's been nice i have
friends who do it i always
uh take a bunch of packs with me when i
travel and when occasionally i go a
little overboard

we all know the value of a truly uh
compelling
narrative cue hunt a killer it's the
murder mystery box that immerses you in
an
ongoing experience with every delivery
or episode you dive deeper into what
it's like being a detective
so they send you a box and in it it has
like uh
it has documents has evidence you're
going over it it's like um
what was that true crime what was that
one on hbo it's like one of those
detectives true detective what was that
true here's the thing i really like
about it and why i got milo into it so
much
no screens you build an investigation
board
you can do it in on an online community
if you want we do not
we do it at home which is great and we
help
each other through each challenge um
part of the proceeds of every box go to
the cold case foundation to help fund
cold case investigations
for me the thing i like it is like i
liked clue when i was a kid
and this is like uber uber clue and it's
ongoing
and it's the only time that milo will
talk to me for the most part
and right now for our listener my
daughter uh right now for our listeners
you can go to huntykiller.com
majority get 20 off your first box they
only accept 200 members per day
so how do you take advantage of this
offer that's hunt a killer
dot com slash majority for 20 off your
first box
huntakiller.com majority
all right so let's continue i just want
to play this uh
noam chomsky clip because when we talk
about
bernie sanders saying that the
people who work for jeff bezos
unsurprisingly have a
tainted perspective to his politics
they they necessarily i mean despite the
fact that if you look
at his platform issue
by issue
his policies are mainstream
as far as the american public is
concerned they
are by any definition of the word
at least in terms of what they have they
hold and support
his policies are mainstream
he is not covered in that way
and his policies are not covered in that
way
and these are the type of people who are
going to work in this type of
institution
largely speaking not all
but many that is going to be the
editorial thrust
on some level is going to be broadly
status quo
this is a a washington post has a
culture and a pedigree that comes from
things like saying that like bill
clinton is not of this place
i mean that is the attitude and culture
that comes from that paper the new york
times
no better in some instances i think
maybe even worse
but here's noam chomsky talking about
this dynamic
gang you don't you don't wait like the
reason the problem that people had in my
work
offended andrew mar i might say the
problem i had
with uh hillary clinton doing those um
speeches for whatever it was 250 400 000
whatever it was was not that she was
going to do something
for those banks because they were giving
her the money
it's that they knew that she was the
type of person who does stuff for them
and that's why they give them the money
yeah they're friends yeah
that's basically it we should we're we
are here right here you and i
like this and so i don't need to
tell you to do anything i just know
you're going to do it
answering organization um
tell me how that works is that you're
not suggesting that
proprietors phone one another up or that
many journalists get to their
copies spiked as we say it's actually
orwell you may recall has an
essay called literary censorship in
england which was supposed to be the
introduction to animal farm except that
it never appeared
in which he points out look i'm writing
about a totalitarian society but in free
democratic england it's not all that
different
and then he says unpopular ideas can be
silenced without any
force it gives a two-sentence
response which is not very profound but
captures it
he says two reasons first the press is
owned by wealthy men who have every
interest in not having certain things
appear
but second the whole educational system
from the beginning on through
just gets you to understand that there
are certain things you just don't say
well spelling these things out that's
perfectly correct
i mean there it's the first sentence is
what we expand
this is what i don't get because it
suggests that i mean i'm a joke people
might be
are self-censoring no not self-centering
uh you're
there's a filtering system that starts
in
kindergarten it goes all the way through
uh and
it's not doesn't work 100 but it's
pretty effective uh it selects for
obedience
and subordination uh and especially i
think
so stroppy people won't make it
influence
behavior problems or if you read
uh applications to a graduate school you
see that people will tell you
he's not he doesn't get along too well
with his colleagues
you know how to interpret those things i
i'm just interested in this because
i was brought up like a lot of people um
probably opposed to watergate film and
so on
to believe that journalism was a
crusading uh
craft and that there were a lot of
disputatious
droppy difficult people in journalism
and i have to say i think i know some of
them
well i know some of the best and best
known investigative reporters in the
united states i won't mention names but
whose attitude or the media is much more
cynical than mine
in fact they regard the media as a sham
and they know and they consciously talk
about how they try to
play it like a violin if they see a
little opening they'll try to squeeze
something in that ordinarily wouldn't
make it through
uh and it's perfectly true that the
major i'm sure you're speaking for the
majority of journalists who are trained
have it driven into their heads that
this is a crusading a
profession adversarial we stand up
against power very self-serving view
on the other hand in my opinion i hate
to make a value judgment but
the better journalists and in fact the
ones who are often regarded
as the best journalists have quite a
different picture
um owned well first of all what i love
about that is like he is
subtweeting the guy sitting right across
from him
before subtweeting even existed no shops
he's
mastered it interview for me i am
talking about you
just in case you were actually wondering
but i'm not going to say that
um and and that is i mean this is the
reality of this now
with that said bernie sanders didn't
come
i i'm quite sure that bernie sanders
understood this dynamic before then
and so i saw bernie sanders speak in
college he made
precisely the same right he spent most
of his speech talking about media
monopoly here's the other part
of why what we talked about earlier is
bs
because all those journalists right
they're making it like he's being
conspiratorial and he's being
uh trump-like what bernie sanders is
doing
is he is he's not discovering the truth
of what is problematic with the media
this is political campaigning
and the other conversation that brian
williams could have had and we played
that stuff earlier
but the other conversation of brian
williams had if he didn't choose bob
costa from the washington post
or the other reporter from wall street
journal
costas i mean he's a good reporter
um started out covering right wing stuff
let's say ryan williams had a different
msnbc contributor on
to talk about this let's say he had me
on
my perspective wouldn't be you know
he's frustrated about the the campaign
this is coming out of frustration in the
way that like you know a child when you
get frustrated because you won't give
them a
you know you won't give them uh they
can't watch the second episode of
television or something like this
they're
they're complaining he's complaining no
what i'd say like look
this is a reality that bernie sanders
knows to be the case
uh we used to talk about media
concentration in this country and the
power of wealthy people
owning the press as being problematic it
still is
even in the era of donald trump when we
have more reliance on the press than we
may have
uh wanted to uh you know admit in the
past
and bernie sanders is using this as an
example
of how corporate interests are aligned
and how they own
this network that we're talking on the
other
networks that we could be talking on and
all the papers
and that we need to rebalance stuff and
from a political perspective this is a
very smart move
this is a very smart move like
brian williams and his guests are not
above
taking a cynical look and looking at the
political value of these machinations
and that's what they do for virtually
every
other single candidate
but they don't do that for bernie
sanders they don't say
with his brand of politics this actually
makes a lot of sense
because um
it's it's perfectly consistent with
everything he's saying
and he's saying that there is uh people
at the uh one percent
let's call it have aligned interests
they don't necessarily have to meet at
davos to plan out their year's agenda
they have aligned interests and they
work in those interests and they have
outsized power
and that's what you get
but even the way that they framed that
segment
was indicative of the problems and even
though jeff bezos doesn't work
at um you know doesn't own msnbc
comcast does ge
does and they're more comfortable
and brian williams certainly understands
this
with stuff that is a little bit
more to the right than where they've
been in the past
you don't need to give jake tapper
questions or talking points but if we
did a really easy
thought experiment if the cnn ad lineup
was filled primarily with um
teamsters unions and uaw ads it's very
unlikely
that he would say john delaney you say
that bernie's healthcare plan is going
to ruin american society would you like
to elaborate i know
i disagree with different i think i
think they use me
maybe maybe the question to to delaney
but the entire
frame of the question would be massaged
and influenced
by the concept jake tapper is not
sensitive to what ads are on there
jake tapper wouldn't be hired right if
this was
i'm not giving you a linea i'm not
saying linearly he watches it
in the same way that it is arranged
broader atmosphere the filtering that
chomsky i mean
i i don't even think it's that that that
sensitive because certainly i know that
unions used to advertise on msnbc i
don't know if they still do
but unions used to advertise on msnbc
because they thought they could
aggregate
the the the biggest audience of the left
there
bp used to advertise on msnbc because
they thought could aggregate
as green they could aggregate the
biggest group of most
outspoken critics of them there um
the advertising thing is just is
ebbs and flows the bottom line is these
are owned by major corporations they
will hire people who are
corporate friendly period end of story
there is no specific pressure that comes
in these um
in these news organizations but the
the the general flow of things
is what leads you down these certain
paths what you get rewarded with
leads you down these paths and they're
not even specific it's not if you do
this you'll get that
it's just broad principles that you see
and you see them more and that's how you
got through the door in the first place
yep i co-sign everything that you said
can i just add two things real quick
please um i agree
with uh chad vigorous or pretty bad
lefties take
on twitter which is that bernie stands
to pick up more votes from
joe rogan fans and cardi b fans than he
does from people who stan
msnbc so maybe this won't be so bad for
him
and two can we just appreciate the
terminally basic mean girl shade on
display
in that first clip like you are only
talking about me for attention
because your campaign is crashing and
burning
sad like if anyone is using a trumpian
line i think it's that
right i think that's true and frankly i
think that
on balance i'm not quite sure
that even the msnbc uh
discussion doesn't help um bernie i mean
definitely to the extent that there were
people out there
who do have issues with corporate
control who watch msnbc
there's some um i think it also
raises um his you know him out there i
don't think that
i don't think this
in its totality actually hurts bernie at
all i think
bernie wants to be in the news and i
don't think it necessarily hurts bernie
to be criticized
by brian williams or by someone from the
wall street journal
in fact like let's recall
what the sort of one of the uh biggest
you know sort of like
piercing things that pierced through the
noise
in terms of bernie's ad campaigns was
here are the people who don't endorse me
and having them all line up
to not endorse him and to criticize him
i think is probably
not a bad thing it's just people should
be aware
of what the dynamics are and how this
how this works because there's more to
be gleaned from this than just
how it impacts bernie sanders i mean we
should be watching the news
always with this perspective and this
understanding these are broad
they're very sort of like long
broad strokes in terms of what impacts
the media in this way and so
uh let's talk about this um
this these these new regulations by the
uh trump administration
um they are um
they're basically a way of limiting
immigration particularly um legal
immigration for people who are already
here
as well um
this public charge stuff and
i mean it fails under the weight of its
own um
rules anyways but here is uh aaron
burnett in the ongoing saga
of ken cuccinelli trying to
make the trump policy
fit in to at the very least the
perception we have about ourselves in
this country
that perception i would say is um
probably a little bit more aspirational
than actual
but nevertheless let's use this frame
when it is um worthwhile
and and to a certain extent
there is an obvious truth to the fact
that it wasn't necessarily always with
open arms
and it wasn't always necessarily
pleasant but this country was built
and has been built through must much of
its history
on taking in refugees and
immigrants from around the world and it
is strengthened
um this uh society
in in many respects um here's aaron
burnett
again returning to ken cuccinelli's
you'll recall yesterday we played this
clip
when he was asked about we'll take in
your poor your wretched
and then he said and he added we'll take
it
we will take in your poor and your
wretched who can stand up on their own
two feet
and blah blah blah now that concept is
good um
for ken cuccinelli we'll we'll pick it
up after this
you say this is about self-sufficiency
and you say that proudly you heard me
play you
uh this morning uh when you quoted the
emma lazarus poem on the statue oh i
wasn't quoting it i was answering a
question
right okay i'm sorry but you were giving
your version of what you thought the
poem should say right
no no i was not you said give me you're
tired
who can stand on i'm not rewriting
poetry okay well what you said is give
me your tired and your poor who can
stand on their own two feet and who will
not become a public charge
i just played you saying it right i
listened okay okay so i'm just making
sure you're not just putting that okay
so obviously the actual poem is quite
different i'm gonna read it right i was
answering a question
i wasn't writing poetry aaron don't
don't change the facts
i'm not changing the facts you're
twisting this like everybody else on the
left is done all day it's important
you're saying
that it's very important to be able to
stand on your own two feet a lot of
people may support you and respect
you're saying that
but the poem doesn't say that right the
poem that's on the statue of liberty
i didn't bring up the poem well an npr
reporter did and now you have
i didn't bring it up i'll answer your
substantive intelligence so i'm going to
give you a substantive
okay however it came up you said
give me your tired and your poor okay
who can stand on their own two feet and
he will not become a public charge
that's what you say i just played it
the poem reads give me your tired your
poor your huddled masses yearning to
breathe
free the wretched refuse of the teaming
shore
send these the homeless tempest tossed
to me i lift my lamp
beside the golden door wretched
poor refuse right that's what the poem
says america's supposed to stand for
so what do you think america
stands for well of course that poem was
referring back
to people coming from europe where they
had class-based
societies where people were considered
wretched if they weren't in the right
class and it was introduced it one now
what the f does this guy talk about yeah
america was a total
communist egalitarian utopia well i
understand i get it
it's his logic his logic is that yes
in in the way he's talking about class
is that in a european context
at that time you might even be
relatively loaded but you're looked down
upon because you don't have a title or
something
and so you can come here and you don't
have to put on errors but you have a lot
of money still so you can
stand on your own two feet so classes i
think it's literally i think that's
basically what he's saying
you don't know the difference between
poor idea
i'm not saying he's i'm telling you how
i think he's spinning it dude
i i think he thinks he's just skipping
over poor i think i think this is like
he should rewrite the bible like the
meek who own their own business
shall inherit the earth the opposite
small business
small business owner i mean aaron may
have hit
may have uh you know emphasized wretched
but the poor seems to be the operative
issue here i think
and not talking i think poor of title
poor of title there's a lot of there's a
lot of old regency dramas about that
type of thing this guy's
he's got a shoe factory i'm sure he
wants to marry the duchess
everything's problem everything's fine
but it's a problem because he ain't a
dude
poor of olive gardens it was written
one year one year after the first
federal public charge rule was written
that says and i'll quote it any person
unable to take care of himself
without becoming a public charge unquote
would be inadmissible or in the terms
that my agency deals with
they can't do what's called adjusting
status getting a green
card becoming legal permanent residence
same exact time
aaron same exact time in the year it
went on the statue of liberty 1903
another federal law was passed expanding
the elements of public charge by
congress this is a i mean when my family
came here they came here
as as crafters from scotland right they
could they had no education
they had nothing right but i am here
because they were allowed in
and i'm an anchor on cnn right so i'm
just saying
my italian grandfather sponsored his two
cousins to come here
this is a tradition that many of our
families yours and mine can point to
aaron we're white we're white from
europe
well we weren't at the time but we are
now
exclusionary uh no no but what i'm
saying is i would have been excluded i
don't know
about you but i i would have been well
no that's not
you're you're deciding on one point and
our isos are going to take what's called
a totality of the circumstances test
which has been long been the test for
public charge
okay and this one he's lying about this
and i'll tell you this
here's the here's the thing um
the public charge thing is a vague term
and the rules and regulations that
define it and according to
this new rules and regulation
they must have a 51 percent
they must assess with each uh potential
um uh immigrant
they must assess that there's a 51
chance that they will end up being a
public charge
now we know that at least
80 percent of all immigrants do not
become
a public charge and there is no subset
of that group
that has any different numbers than that
you can't say
only 50 percent of of immigrants from
guatemala
don't become public charges or only
you know only um 40 percent
of people from maldeva
moldovia moldova whatever
don't become uh public charges there is
no department of homeland statistics
that would indicate that you can make an
assessment
on any group of immigrants that they're
going to be
a public charge
51 sure so this is ripe for abuse
and it's intimidating immigrants and
it's total
bs well he's not lying about the law
from 1882 though
like it's crazy it's funny because i had
it pulled up before he even brought it
up
i pulled it up at the beginning of this
segment no i have the law here
that that the statue of liberty has been
lying since the beginning
no he's not because the public charge
rule had to do
with a lot of different stuff at that
time than what he's made it out to be
you could obviously get in if you were
poor the question is
do you have someone who is going to
vouch for you
it seems like well that's my point is
they've changed
it's it's not the same idea it it is it
is the same idea
but in practice it's radically different
that's the whole point why they've
changed the rule the public charge rule
well i'll also add that the criminal
provision of the act did not include
immigrants who were convicted of
political offenses
reflecting the traditional american
belief that the united states is a haven
for those persecuted by foreign tyrants
and that's definitely not being honored
now
right all right let's go to the uh
phones
yeah you got a phone up
come from a 509 area code who's this
509. hey hello hello
this is ronald reagan is this me yes
yeah hey
ronald reagan um tell us about this
public charge thing cuomo
huh oh oh
oh you want to talk about immigration
okay yeah well i have
okay yeah that's fine um
so for public charge uh it might help
just real quick to
talk about the way that it already
exists so if i
have a client who's a foreign national
um let's just say he's mexican
and he's been here for 20 years working
and supporting himself
and without access to the the public
uh safe the social safety net and he
gets married to u.s citizens she wants
to petition for him
she has to also file this affidavit to
support this contract with the
government but if she's a stay-at-home
mom
even though he's been completely
self-sufficient for many years in this
country
um his income doesn't count towards
the affidavit of support um because it
doesn't technically come from a legal
source since he's working without
permission so anyhow
this person who's been totally
self-sufficient has to go and find a
co-sponsor
usually a family member maybe a boss
and ask them to sign off um on the same
sort of
contract that they'll support this
person yeah and let's just be clear here
i just want to be clear here and and you
gotta you gotta talk a little more
uh clearly because you're there's
something going on with your phone that
it sounds a little weird but
this this affidavit is a contract where
you're basically it's almost like you're
guaranteeing a
um you know an apartment for uh for
somebody
right it's like if if they don't pay the
rent i will pay the rent
right except right but not for bills and
things like that but
um you know for any type of uh news
tested benefits
and so um that that's an obstacle for a
lot of people even though
like i said they've already been working
uh they're very self-resistant
and and the new rule is like 800 pages
long
but there's some pretty nefarious stuff
in there like they can look at
english language skills to determine
whether or not the person
could be self-sufficient um that's never
been
a requirement obviously they can do
credit score
uh credit checks and uh
and more things like that but uh overall
it's just creating a sense of fear
it doesn't apply to a lot of types of
immigrants like asylums or refugees but
even those people
have been taking their kids off of
uh you know medicaid or obamacare
thinking that they're going to be
rounded up and deported
if they get food stamps for example for
the u.s citizen children
but one of the things that i think is
not really being reported
which is pretty nefarious about all of
this is that
uh uscis which is a benefits agency it's
not
ice it's not uh border patrol
ronald reagan hold on hold on for a
second can you
wha what are you talking into yeah what
are you talking into
are you talking into a phone like are
you talking to a headset yeah
headset oh that's better whatever you
just did right that's much better okay
yeah much better okay okay i turned off
my prius
great i'm gonna i'm gonna die i can't
hear you i don't know
so uh uscis
um has made two other changes
uh one is that if they if you file for a
green card
they can uh essentially deny the case
typically they'll issue a request for
evidence if they're unsatisfied with
the evidence that you filed or that you
submitted
but they they announced this change i
don't know maybe a year ago or so saying
if we're unsatisfied rather than issue a
request for evidence we can just flat
deny the case
and so you're then out the 1200
filing fee if you if you filed for a
green card so that's one change and the
other change is that there's going to be
more aggressive than issuing
uh notices to appear to removal
proceedings for cases that they deny
so if you take a situation where
now instead of just looking at an
affidavit of support and
does somebody support you who earns
enough money yes or no
well now we're going to look at all of
these other circumstances like
what kind of uh diseases you might have
or uh if you speak enough english
uh all of these other things and we're
gonna use that as a pretext to deny your
application
and we're gonna be more aggressive in
denying applications and
in forwarding your case to the
immigration court for deportation
proceedings
it has a real uh chilling effect
and also can result in you know lots of
good people
of being denied and tied up in hearings
for years and years so
uh this guy's a real douchebag
ken cuccinelli uh with all due respect
um but it's not just the affidavit of
support
and and the the public charge thing
although i think it's
that's horrible um but it's it's just
sort of
combination of three or four different
policies
uh which make it possible to to really
target people and
and and turn what's supposed to be a
benefits agency
into an enforcement agency right um
and there's also a lot of other types of
cases where people have to go back to
their country to consular process
and that's uh you know
they've emboldened the consular officers
to uh deny more cases
uh on the affidavit of support in the on
the public
charge grounds and the problem with that
is that
uh if you if you go to consular process
in mexico let's say
um and if they deny the affidavit of
support now instead of being in mexico
for
a couple of weeks the process can really
drag on
you could be down there for three or
four months
and for a lot of people that's not an
option and so you know more and more
people are going to just
stop applying for things that they
perfectly qualify for
um and do you know about the 1882 law
wait a second wait wait wait let me let
me just we can get to the 1882 law in a
second
uh so what when you say that people are
applying for benefits
what what benefits are they eligible for
now
i mean based on their status
um well usually
um people aren't applying for
uh benefits for themselves it's for
their us citizen children
right which is perfectly fine so uh
food stamps or things like that um
under the current rules um
uh medicaid and and obamacare those
sorts of things are
are okay um mostly it's uh you know tanf
and certain things like that that
they're not
uh supposed to be getting or i think
like certain types of emergency medical
uh treatment um could be
included the affidavit of support
typically
is used it's not enforced
all that much by the government but it
can be used
in the family court context in
in a divorce so when michael brings over
his um
his wife from wherever moldova
right there you go and it's amazing
you'd want to make that joke
yeah his wife his wife um
yeah and then he's like you know he
kicks her to the curb because it's
michael
right uh she could use the affidavit of
support
in in their divorce proceedings to say
look this guy promised to uh provide for
me
and and that's typically how it's
enforced but
so it is also enforceable by the
government there are are there
situations where someone is in here
they have no papers that they're getting
tenth
support
no right are there are there instances
where people are in here without papers
and they're getting food stamps
now so what we're talking about is we're
talking about people who
have a legal status
but they're enroute to trying to become
citizens
because their kids are citizens or
they're getting married to a citizen or
uh their their their parents are
citizens maybe
theoretically i guess and they're simply
right and and so they have they have
some type of residency status here they
have some type of visa
they're legal
right well so it's it's people who are
who are either uh
so they're not applying for citizenship
applying for permanent residency or a
green card
so they're either going from
undocumented or
um what they call a non-immigrant visa
so like a student visa or a temporary
visa to
being allowed to stay here permanently
with the green card so it's in that
process
that you know they look at all kinds of
grounds of inadmissibility or reasons to
deny your green card it could be
terrorism grounds or immigration
negative immigration history there's a
big long list of things that can
disqualify you and public charge is one
and it has been one for a long time
basically since like 1997 they've said
just fill out this form prove that you
earn 150
of the poverty guidelines based on your
household
size and that's sufficient to to not be
denied a green card
because of the on public charge grounds
and now what they're saying is well we
don't want to just
look at how much you're making or how
much your sponsor is making
we want to be able to pull back the
curtain and look at all of these other
things
and um you know let's run a credit score
of you or your wife or your your
co-sponsor
or let's you know take a look at how
much english you're you're speaking and
and these sorts of things so um
yeah they're they're widening they're
wide they're raising the bar
essentially is what they're doing and
they're looking for any type of excuse
to deny people
all right so jamie had a question about
the original underlying law
of uh the public charge that cuccinelli
was talking yeah like
reading through the language in this law
i don't see how what's happening now is
not
a legacy of immigration policy that
we've
had for a very long time
right yeah i think that's true and it in
a way like when cuccinelli is like hey
well the statue of liberty we meant
europeans like he's telling a more
accurate version of history than people
who are like this isn't
who we are and we're better than this
it's like
no we're not and and his version of
of the history and and of our
immigration history
specifically is actually pretty accurate
and and that's the problem right so
like getting lost in some poem um
rather than talking about the the
realities of
of our policies over the last uh hundred
plus years
seems like a real um failure on the part
of the media
how was i how was how was the uh
charge law though used i mean 97
obviously it was amended what was it
prior to that
um i don't i don't know too much about
that i was in like middle school so
well you knew about 97
no i mean i'm not sure exactly um
you know i think it's been pretty much
the same
um for for quite a while um
but um i'm not sure if it was
more strictly enforced or less strictly
enforced i'm sure it sort of
ebbed and flowed right to some degree
but i don't know specifically
all right well thanks for uh yeah i mean
this guy's a real piece of work and uh
he's terrible i did want to ask you real
quick about chris cuomo
yeah um
don't you think it was kind of lame that
he stepped to this guy and threatened to
push him down a flight of stairs
that's like stepping to somebody and
threatening to push him in front of a
bus
kind of right like i think you're either
going to fight a guy
or you're not but don't like use a
flight of stairs to win the fight for
you
oh to me that was the most defensive
part of the whole thing i i thought it
was good
okay i think um
yeah i mean ronald reagan i mean that's
looking like a guy who really clearly
never uh never gotten in any type of
like altercation
uh with another guy that's his way of
saying like
i'm gonna beat you up and then i can do
with you whatever i want
like i.e throw you down the stairs that
was like um
what that guy said to that guy the um um
the the former staten islands
congressman when he's like i'm gonna
throw you over the edge here at this
road time like a boy
yeah it's i wish uh i don't think he's
being literal i think uh i don't think
he was
i think what cuomo was actually saying
was like i'm gonna threaten you until
one of my posse comes here and gets in
between us
so that we don't actually have to have a
fight because i know i'm gonna get sued
i thought it was funny how he said i'll
throw you down the stairs and i'm smart

a little bit i mean
look it's a free speech issue if you
don't like me
hey hey hey shut up thank you for
calling into the majority report
sam will be with you shortly
did you you confirmed the name of that
reporter right
well that's what i have in my inbox that
okay that's must been what it was
i can't hear his microphone it's
microphone oh okay
okay um
let's go oh i'm gonna fire up the im
machine it's the fun half ladies and
gentlemen super
fun half of the
program um
here is uh donald trump defending ken
cuccinelli
for rewriting the uh the poem
now again i agree the poem is
aspirational our country has never been
um
uh you know as as welcoming uh to
immigrants as we um sort of pretend
that we have been but there is no doubt
that immigrant populations in this
country
have um well i mean to some extent we're
all immigrants
um here but the ones that we consider
to be immigrant you know waves of
immigration
have um undeniably
uh made this country to the extent that
it's um
a great one a great one
and uh here's donald trump though um ken
guccianelli just
can't they're so insular that they just
don't know how this sounds
to to people outside of it and again the
question is they've redefined
and provided their uh henchmen and
incidentally this is being done at a
time where the trump administration
is attacking the unions representing
immigration judges
because the union makes sure that the
immigration judges have some
independence from the doj
remember jeff sessions want all the
immigrant judges to basically say like
you know you have to decide basically
you know here's a color chart and if
they cross this
um this uh a shade of brown
they're not eligible something it's an
exaggeration
it's an exaggeration but it's on that
continuum maybe exactly
and it's like we found proxies actually
that we uh
scientifically tested can find actually
the hue of the person that is standing
in front of you without having to
um to actually just stand in front of
this light sir exactly i feel like they
hired a weird british guy for that
um but nevertheless
um here is uh donald trump defending
ken cuccinelli
maybe there ought to be a different poem
on the statue of liberty
that
a big says well i don't think it's fair
to have the american taxpayer you know
it's about america first
i don't think it's fair to have the
american taxpayer
paying for people that come into the
united states
so what we've done is institute what
took place many many years ago
at our founders virtually but we are
just
reinstituting it and i think it's long
overdue
i am tired of seeing our taxpayer paying
for people to come into the country
and immediately go on to welfare and
various other things
first of all that doesn't happen it just
doesn't happen
um i mean obviously it happens to some
extent but it certainly happens uh to a
lesser extent
than native born americans um and
uh the the amount that immigrants put
into the economy and pay in terms of
taxes
is still a net positive
and their you they don't have the
ability which is really the bottom line
to make these assessments in any
accurate way
unless it's like patently obvious
someone comes in they don't have the
ability to work or they don't have the
ability to care for themselves
they don't have someone who's going to
sponsor and guarantee
that
that they won't need that type of
support
so um there you have it
it would be fine if they did though like
people
are entitled to a basic level of
a humane life no matter where they're
from or who they are
i mean i think that's true and um i
don't know that
you know the american public would
necessarily agree with that broadly
speaking
um and i think from a moral standpoint
we should take in uh anybody that
that that that comes um
but i think you know broadly speaking
for the american public i mean this is
obviously
they're doing this for
not just for ideological reasons but
because they perceive that this
is the what their voters want
and they are trying to create a wedge
where
they are getting democrats to get on
stage
and say we should let anybody in even if
they're going to immediately your tax
dollars are going to go
pay for them i mean this is the same
dynamic that they have been demonizing
all sorts of welfare programs um
since you know the the mid 60s
which is to make it as if all these
money you're paying in taxes just go
to black people uh or
two mexicans um i remember studying
the welfare state for everyone i
remember a study from the 80s
where it was like or yeah i think it was
late 80s but it was basically
chomsky used to cite it all the time but
it was basically that from news coverage
americans believed that the the majority
like they didn't even overshoot they
thought that most of their tax dollars
in the federal budget went to welfare
and foreign aid
right right incredible propaganda job
and they i bet you they also believe
that the majority of their of the money
that goes to welfare goes to black
people
well not only well i mean of course i
mean there's a reason why those two
things were even correlated in the poll
like why why you know welfare programs
and foreign aid are not necessarily at
all the same thing right like i get in
some ways how there aren't a continuum
but of course
racializing it would even connect those
two things
so firmly to begin with oh yeah like
here's all the money we're giving to
other people
across the board and that's why
anti-racism has to play such an
important role
in getting back some semblance of the
welfare state
right and mass politics but i feel like
where we got hung up on
yesterday was that you were arguing more
in the short term and i was arguing more
in the long term
about this stuff because it is true down
the line
i see climate change is going to cause
massive waves of migration around the
world like we know that that's true i
don't have the numbers in front of me
and until we take a hard look
at borders and the idea of
border enforcement and keeping people
out of
our particular state where the stage is
set for kind of eco-fascism and i
really don't want to see us go there
i'm not sure i follow but um listen to
the antifata
i i i will uh
here is um
here is ainsley earhart trying
you know she has a friend incidentally
who has an
all um chicken salad
uh restaurant it's an enterprise and
that is gonna be um
she worries about the the future of that
chicken salad enterprise particularly if
if immigrants are all getting um you
know all sorts of taxpayer large ass
refugees asylum seekers not part of this
but it is folks who come here
listen it's common sense if you're a
taxpayer you want to know your dollars
are
going to people who if they're here are
doing so productively
if you show a pattern of dependency why
would we want you to become a permanent
resident or a citizen
as opposed to the folks who say i've
worked hard two or three jobs to provide
for my family
i want to do it the right way legally to
get a green card that and that's what
the trump administration has said those
are the folks we welcome it is common
sense think about it
usually people come over here and they
get a green card so that they can work
in a restaurant or whatever they want to
work a better opportunity but
to come over to our country when you're
not fleeing your country because you're
not in danger you're just coming to
lives
on our soil shouldn't you contribute to
problem is the left has created
incentives for that when you can get a
driver's license get free college you
can free health care and then ultimately
positive
well first of all we don't have free
health care yet we don't have the free
college yet
and getting a driver's license i
wouldn't say is like a huge benefits
just a way in which you can work
also a way to vote illegally right
exactly to take you to the polls
but the fact of the matter is is the
point is is that
to the extent that people subscribe to
this notion
that you don't want to allow a citizen
regardless of
who their family is or um whether their
family is here
whether they are in any way inhibited
from working
because of ailment or whatnot i mean
even if you subscribe to their
ideological perspective on that that's
where we're at now
this rule is about denying people that
assessment based upon stuff that has
no reasonable way
of predicting that
they would not be if not self-sufficient
largely self-sufficient
free health care and then ultimately
food stamps and possibly voting i mean
all of that leads to
that culture and that's what the
president's trying to fight
i mean what culture well the culture of
dependencies
browning the culture of brown the or as
nas said in african-looking manhattan
although he meant it in a positive way
but i i think
it's also just so like
the way you can not talk about the
foreign policy dimensions of this stuff
across the board right and there's no
contradictions for
ruthlessly protesting and fighting
against and dismantling what they're
doing
and at the same time whether we're
talking about ecological policies
or direct us interference in places as
well or
european or chinese for that matter
these are it's just going to be
impossible to solve i mean you can
you can directly correlate just even
specifically
honduras with this massive spike going
back to
the obama administration backing a coup
against manuel zelaya right in 2009
and now they have a narco state with
massive street protests happening i mean
the foreign policy dimension is so
obvious and inescapable and you have to
ask those people
when they talk about our borders and
blah blah blah
how they think they take they take that
stuff seriously when they
continue to push these foreign policy
paradigms that generate instability in
crisis as long as you fly over the
border
well there you go it doesn't have the
same idea it's different it's a
different flow
uh calling from a shoot
248 area code who's this where you
coming from
sounds like an insightful caller going
once
248. hello hello
hi you got me yeah yeah hey this is
karen calling from michigan
hello how are you today good how are you
doing what's on your mind yeah here i'm
going to mute the tv maybe that'll help
yeah i'm calling because you know i've
been listening to this well yesterday
you
you were talking about you know
immigrants and they come here for these
great jobs
i worked at a meat department for five
years
in michigan in a you know legitimate
grocery store it was 29 degrees in there
all the time
and you're standing on a cold concrete
floor
so it's freezing in the middle of summer
i had to wear you know jackets
and sweatshirts and everything else
right
the floor got wet it was dangerous
you know and this was after everything
had been slaughtered and cut up and put
in
just big packages so if you had to
uh cut a chicken into pieces it was just
one of those
chickens like you find in the counter
and we just take it on the bandsaw and
zip it in half you know
it was not a big deal well that it's you
know it's
it's hazardous anyway because there's
all these germs and everything
you get to take that home with you right
and then like i said the floor gets
slippery i felt once and got a terrible
concussion because the floor got wet
in a spot so if it's like that for
me and um in michigan
and and we have the state come in and
inspect that enough they don't tell you
when they're coming they just make sure
everything is
kosher imagine how it's going to be for
migrant workers in these um
slaughterhouse factories
slaughterhouse oh yeah my dad said oh
you know
because he lived on a farm and then he
went to a slaughterhouse and
he said they're just horrible
he was disgusted and he'd seen a lot of
things i bet
so you can't tell me all these people
they're taking our jobs
you know gee you want it and go take it
they'll be glad to share
the thing is though i started listening
to chomsky yesterday and i figured out
the reason
that we're so short on jobs is because
the jobs are going to slaves in the
prisons
i mean why couldn't a person who's not
in prison
make a license plate and get paid a
decent wage
and slaves overseas that was
revolutionary for me
there's a lot of prison labor
yeah you know we're not paying them any
money or 10 cents on the hour or
something ridiculous and they when they
get out of prison they owe money
and they have to pay the state back
so this whole thing about um you want to
know why you don't have a job it's
because they keep locking able-bodied
people up in jail and not paying them
any money to take your job well i think
there's a lot of dreams
there's a lot of different reasons i
think that's one of them i appreciate
the call karen
yeah yeah this is just one more reason
why prison abolition needs to be
incorporated
into a workers movement
come from a 415 area code who's this
where we call him from
oh hi sam yes
hi oh hi my name is joe fenberg i wow
it's cool to be on the show
joe um so i actually i'm calling because
yeah
joe where are you calling you hear me
okay yeah where you calling from
san francisco california okay sounds
like calling from the highway what's up
what's up
what's up i'm walking i'm walking down
the street right now
um so i guess i wanted to ask your
opinion on two things
um i've heard you say a lot of things
about israel in your show and i'm i'm
also jewish like you
um i wanted to know what you think would
be a fair and just solution for the
israeli-palestinian conflict
okay secondly when debating people on
the
center-right or alt-lite how do you
convince them that they're wrong
when they argue in bad faith and say
that fascism is left-wing
or they try and conflate communism with
fascism
well people who call antifa fashion well
i don't know that you convinced those
people i mean i i i have arguments with
those people for the sake of other
people who are not
arguing in in bad faith
um and so uh that
that's that one in terms of like a
a just a solution in israel um
one that i think is actually we'll put
aside for a moment what i think is
actually doable
because i don't know what is doable at
this point to be honest with you
uh and i've always thought giving sorry
well i mean i i i would have i would
like to have seen
you know full return of the west bank to
the palestinians i would like to see
jerusalem
an international city uh
internationalized in some way
i'd like to give three 1967 borders 67
and um okay i i would also
like to see some type of if not
if not right of return reparations mixed
in with like a right of return for
people who lost their
homes and their uh and were dispossessed
um yeah but that's a pipe stream at this
point isn't it well
look i'm not convinced that all of it is
in a pipe dream to be honest with you
so i mean that's my point is like i i
don't know what the
i don't know what is practical
or possible at this point i mean i
really i don't
i mean i i i i think if we got rid of
bibi
if bibi was no longer prime minister
there'd be a way to possibly have a vote
in the parliament
about the knesset about having a um
some kind of special citizenship status
given to palestinians living in the west
bank in gaza
like um i think a possible solution
would be to convince jordan
to give them citizenship and then grant
all jordanian citizens permanent
residency in israel
and maybe like exemption from income tax
and uh
exemption from property tax to
incentivize it so you know
gaza could become the las vegas of
israel that that that seems a little bit
rube goldberg to me and i don't know how
it's sustainable going forward
i mean what you're going to have i mean
are you going to have
um a special class of citizenry that
um i mean presumably like their children
would have that same sort of status
this sort of like weird quasi
have no uh tax responsibilities i mean
it's
and then to think that that's
sustainable down the road where uh
other citizens are gonna wait wait a
second why don't these people
have to pay taxes in our society i just
don't think that well they'd be
permanent rather they'd be citizens of
jordan and they'd be permanent residents
in israel
this is so i'm sorry this is this is
just nuts
i mean this is like this is like some
type of hybrid like dubai
like almost like like foreign service
workers situation
i i mean look i actually got the i got
the idea when i was in
australia and i saw that new zealanders
have a similar arrangement in australia
right but here's the big difference
between new zealand and australia and
israel and palestine
australia doesn't occupy new zealand and
not allow anybody democratic or
political rights
and also i just have to say and
regardless of what one thinks of hamas
or whatever
i think you have to at least somewhat
consider some of the local sensibilities
in a place like gaza and i think going
from like a
sort of slightly islamic oriented
government to being the las vegas of
israel is
i think you got to go back to the
drawing board on a lot of things i would
also suggest that
new zealanders who go to australia may
have that
that deal but they also have a uh
sovereign country that they can return
to precisely that is not
right you know it's not like we said
like okay well how about this
instead of new zealand all the new
zealanders you'll become
uh citizens of of indonesia
and uh but you'll have a special benefit
in
australia and then you can go back and
live i mean i just
i i mean i think it's imaginative
but i don't it's also it's also just i
just have to say too like it ain't just
bibi
people need to let go of that there's
zero incentive for the whole
far-right structure of israel and some
of barack's talking points which
to be fair some other members of this
new centrist block have slightly pushed
back against but
barack's first instinct he's the lead of
it there's a
undoubtedly guilty of some of war crimes
but i think he
was a centrist leader who was willing to
make concessions and that does not exist
anymore
uh appreciate the call which is sad
yes it is sad that's that i like
situations sad exactly uh
hdw on the uh ims trump is like
captain planet villain come to life
ainsley earhart is like a nazi stepford
wife
contagious chameleon i think um coming
on the heels of that joe rogan interview
that this media attack on bernie will
help him
i mean the first thing that rogan fans
see after this interview is the
mainstream attacking him it reinforces
their view that he's an enemy of the
elite
yeah i mean i would love to get my hands
on like sort of the demographics of um
of rogan's uh audience to be honest with
you but
i think it's actually i mean it's
obviously very disproportionately male
he is
but i think it at least anecdotally
there's a hell of a lot more you think
disproportionately male or almost
exclusively male 1 because
no no i was about to say our channel
well right i'm
okay all of youtube is insanely over rep
most of youtube i think political
youtube political youtube but um
on the anecdotal side there's a lot of
people
that i mean he's got when you have that
type of audience like
i know plenty of people who it's like
they don't they're like yeah he seems
like a nice guy i watched him interview
michael pollan because i'm interested in
that
when you hit that range he he's he's
intersecting with a much broader
audience i think
well they might realize and i also think
in a weird way his position
is more representative of what you could
call some type of like
quote-unquote center in some ways than
cnn
but uh but yeah i think it's i think
it's all
i think it's all good news for bernie i
think it's the same i think it's
just like the anti-endorsement list i
agree uh i love sarah palin sam good on
you for having tim
on as a guest yesterday he helped me
move on single-payer from the public
option when he was on that unnamed
you read that yesterday we got that
yesterday i read that yesterday
tim faust wow sam you're doing the whole
jews run the media thing you're really
showing your libertarian bone a few days
i thought you were better than that why
are you playing this clip of noam
chomsky if he was so smart how come i've
never seen him on cable news
uh bob carmody why don't any reporters
ask trump where
are is all the billions we're getting
from china actually going
i yeah i don't know maybe doesn't answer
it central mass comrades you see
yesterday that idiot dave portnoy of
barstool sports breaking labor laws on
twitter yesterday he gave us pat fans a
bad name
you know i saw that tweet
and i i i was like wait
does this guy work at barcelona like i
didn't know who he was i was like that
is
that was stunning wait the one where he
said unions are for
no no the one where he said like
somebody
i think it was him somebody tweeted
something like hey if you know anybody
who
who wanted something like you know like
anybody wants to talk to a union rep or
talk about unions tweet at me
and he like like blatantly violated the
law
he he he uh quote tweeted it like
anybody does this is gonna be fine
[Laughter]
now i know he did tweet out in today's
world you
being in a union is for without
that i didn't see the other one oh yeah
and someone had the correct take on that
which is
you know it's mask off time for the
connection between toxic masculinity and
bourgeoisie i love that though i wanna
i wanna
sam gets leaked out guys everybody
going to reunions like being a yes
do you see
that is it's
that i've heard though like i've that
that would be the last
like criticism i would have i would love
to drive a crew of teamsters up to this
guy's first part sports and ds man i
will fire you on the spot
somebody so this guy rafi let's letzer i
don't know who he is he must
be he's like a wga rep i think if you
work for bar stool and you want to have
a private chat about the unionization
process how little power your boss has
to stop you and how you can leverage
that
power to make your life better my dms
are open and
dave border said if you work for
barstool sports dm this man i'll fire
you on the sport
and that is
the most explicit
of the national labor relations act that
i think one could see
he should have had it he should have
added if you were one of my lawyers
and you didn't vet my tweets i will fire
you on the spot
if i was to sum up like if someone said
could you sum up the national labor
relations act in one sentence like
what's the
what's the heart of it it is
you cannot threaten to fire
your employee if they if they uh anyway
multi-billion dollar industry like
refining
how to threaten your employees without
actually doing it how to discourage them
how to propagandize how to imply how to
and this guy's just like how you punish
them without it make it look like you're
publishing them
but like literally i know what i'll do
i'm gonna go on twitter and tell them if
you do this
you'll be fired it's sort of like uh
that that theory
in that movie silver streak with um um
with gene wilder and um uh
oh god richard pryor where they the idea
was like
you the louder you are or maybe that was
the young frankenstein the louder you
are the less they pay attention to you
so maybe he thought if i'm
so explicit nobody's gonna notice
right it's nice to know though barstool
sports is not merely appropriating
dumb bro culture to make money right it
really is
by dumbbells they're really really bad
on copyrights they've they will ding you
for
like general feed videos they've like
they suck
attorney andrew just want to remind
everybody that jamie kilstein still
exists has a podcast and just had david
from unsaid podcast um
and yet his podcast is still better than
another podcast because he didn't take
my money on a lie and then have david
frum
oh tucker tuck face
carlson sam it uh probably wasn't mere
coincidence if bernie was on rogan's
show shortly after cornell west what
about elon musk twetting out his support
for yang just a couple days after the
rogan sanders episode went live
there you go uh amg from
nc hey you guys i know it's kind of hard
annoying to self-censor and not cuss
when talking
thank you guys for trying it has helped
me openly listen to you guys in front of
my parents when i pick them up
they always get cussed out at work and
so they'd rather not hear it outside of
work
wait they get cussed out at work per oh
my god well that's
possible i was just about to make a joke
about that but i will not i'm sorry
i contend that the value of not cussing
in in this context and what we do is
uh such a net positive over the value of
cussing you do
a lot of cussing when you're
discouraging unionization off air
off air yes you you you guys catch me
you blankety blank
blankety blank people if you like blank
blank blank
uh anybody on any
i actually really do i i just i i think
uh
i mean now it's just a totally different
show but i think the phase when
stern first went to satellite and it was
basically pretty much a similar show
it was definitely funnier when they had
to not
like when they crossed every line
imaginable except for just like word
lines
right there was something actually
really funny about right because the
juxtaposition of like
anything goes and then are these very
kind of silly arbitrary
rules was pretty funny absolutely all
right oh okay
so let's let's do this for a moment
um i don't know when we did this
some um uh you know video of uh
of of matt walsh this is the guy from
the daily wire
oh is he the uh the minimum wage guy the
minimum wage guy
and this is uh i mean i refer to him as
like the not funny matt walsh
because i know matt walsh who is
actually
successful and funny and he's a um
he's an actor and a comedian he was a ub
guy
and this is the not funny
matt walsh and we did a video
about uh i guess a video he did on the
minimum wage
and um he
a listener sent this to us um
i guess i don't know why it took so long
i don't know when he did this
on his show maybe a couple weeks ago or
something
um and and so he
uh apparently was very upset because he
felt like i was just mocking him the
whole time that we did like something
like a 20 minute video on him
and he uh he said that uh
sam says pathetically steamrolled yeah
sam says i'm irrelevant but he spent 20
minutes on me
making fun of us and i just want to be
this is more of like a general show note
we do three hours a day and when i see
someone out there who is saying
something stupid about the minimum wage
that doesn't mean that i think you're
relevant
it just means that i think your point
was stupid and you're just copying
some right wing talking point and you're
a good vehicle
for me to discuss it we're not on the
matt
walsh's turning people beat here i
want to make that clear definitely did
not remember this guy's
anything until today's sound sheet i
know i know that he
talks a lot about abortion that's the
only thing that i associate
him with i just remember i remember the
minimum wage stuff but
it's like people should have babies and
let me just preface this
with this because this is gonna get a
little bit weedy because he he was
very very upset that all we did was make
fun of him saying that he
his work was worthless that it looked
like he didn't prepare
did we do the hockey well we do support
the minimum wage but if anybody's not
gonna get paid for their work maybe it
should be
this guy well no he was trying to make
the argument
that you are always paid what you're
worth
that that's what happens and the minimum
wage is wrong and i was suggesting
that he that what you
what you deserve you're always paid what
you deserve and what you're worth
to the employer and i was suggesting
like no
i think you you the work you're doing is
an example that you don't get paid what
you're worth assuming you get paid
anything
and maybe he doesn't maybe it's an
elaborate internship
it's it's possible but and then he was
upset
he he was upset that i compared him to
my 14 year old daughter
and he said that was rude of me to do to
my daughter and that's
probably true because that's good
there's times where i think she's more
astute than this guy
but my point was daughter son any uh
junior high uh student and and and i
have to
maybe amend this early junior high like
more like sixth or seventh grade
as opposed to like eighth grade when
things get a little more sophisticated
so here's and then he complained because
we didn't really address
his argument and and so
let's let's play some clips from this
but this is going to get a little bit
weedy
it this is such a basic concept that
i i didn't think i'd have to but but
matt
believes that workers get
paid exclusively based upon
their value to
an employer in other words how much do
they make for the employer
so let's just keep that in mind let's
let's listen to what he's saying here
probably someone who's going to be fired
that's someone who's not going to
have a job anymore so sam's exactly
right about that
so apparently i think that was like
where matt also thinks that you can make
theoretically zero as an employee but
if you're not making any money then
you're not really an employee
now that's a sticking point but it's
it's relevant
because having a job is not just about
like well you know
it is you're setting aside your labor as
a commodity
and you're also having to deliver that
and provide for it to the employer but
go ahead
i think he's getting it maybe he's maybe
he's catching on the people who are on
the minimum wage
the real minimum wage in this scenario
are probably going to be the people
who mostly don't have jobs they have
zero worth to any employer
thus they have no job thus their wage in
effect
is zero and that's the starting point
okay
the least amount you can be worth to an
employer
is nothing right no
wrong because if you're worth nothing to
an employer
you're not an employee they're not an
employer this is a relationship between
two people
i don't walk around in my life
as an employer you do it's very
confusing i've seen you at uh
don't say to me like and i go into the
supermarket well there's one of our
employers
i've had some coffees with sam and it's
so bizarre where he said he just will
look up and say
you offered nothing to this this is
important because he doesn't understand
what work is and he doesn't understand
how
employers when they are employing
people make assessments about their
worth
and continue least amount you can be
worth to an employer
is nothing right
what's hard to understand about this
have you ever heard of the concept of
xero sam
it's possible to be worth nothing to an
employer for instance right now i
am as an employee i am worth nothing to
um subway because i don't work for them
so i get paid zero from them i i'm worth
nothing to them my my wage from them is
zero right all right
what i'm saying is that a minimum wage
of 15 now i know that's
it's but and i know i'm not supposed to
make fun of him on this but he's doing
this from notes
he's taking this off from notes
the old we all work for everybody and
nobody argument
what i'm saying is that a minimum wage
of 15. now i know that's
it's an obvious point but so you might
say why am i
why am i bringing it up well because
people like sam struggle with it
so i feel like i have to you know he's
someone on a remedial level here which
is fine you know i'm not i'm not making
fun of them but
so i've got to just slow down and spell
this out for
what i'm saying is that a minimum wage
of 15 an hour
doesn't make sense because it assumes it
commands really
that every person who has a job must
necessarily be worth at least 15 an hour
to their employer just by the fact
that they exist and they walked in the
door i don't think that's the case
so sam of course goes for another
personal dig there as you saw says that
i'm worth
zero to my employer um
but again not an argument that's just an
insult a lame one
and here's the thing sam it's also not
our accuracy it's actually kind of funny
because
i'm i'm not worth a zero to mine player
i'm not even worth a zero to you
because you're using me for content
that's true
um all right well look i i don't know
the prob the basic problem that that
matt has is that he assumes that wages
are set
based upon the
value that the
worker produces for the
employer and if that was the case
if that was the only thing now obviously
i'm not going to hire workers unless i
think they're going to provide
value to my business that's obvious
but if it was the case that there was
some type of very specific algorithm
that a worker has to produce
x and they are worth y to me
then you wouldn't see things like
this chart this chart
is the gap between productivity and a
typical worker's compensation
that gap has increased significantly
since 1973 now let me just before we go
into this
let's make it clear you'll see that as
you go up to like
1973 from this starts in 1947
that dynamic is used as the baseline
there
is necessarily there is
necessarily a delta
between the difference between
what a worker's productivity is and what
their compensation is
this is ultimately out of that chunk of
money
comes paying for capital improvements
paying for technology paying the rent
paying for uh the goods that come in
and then profit
now your rent may be fixed
your systems cost may be fixed
to some degree maybe you can improve the
efficiencies
the investment you have to make in your
uh your
you know your equipment may be more or
less
fixed your labor costs
maybe you can fudge those and your
profit
okay now so understand even though it
looks like
these two lines are
are equal there's still a that's just
because it's indexed to 1947.
well maybe the workers just got lazy
starting around 1973.
well if that was the case in 1973 you
would not see
productivity continue to rise in the
same fashion
however hourly compensation
goes flat line there while productivity
goes up
so that delta
grew significantly during that period of
time
now which is not to say that there
wasn't a delta before then but again
it was static because it's indexed at
1947.
but just the existence of the ability of
hourly compensation
versus the productivity to change
disproves
all of matt walsh's theory that you are
paid what you are worth to an employer
because
the value of those employees did not go
down
from 1973 until 2000 whatever
17 when that chart was finished it
continued to go
up in fact i think it went up slightly
steeper
than it had gone before which means that
productivity got even
more efficient and there was even more
productivity
but compensation barely budged
sam i do have a question for you though
what would you say the relative value
you're
providing as an employee to north end
motor sales
i would say it's a used car dealership
in worcester
zero right right so you can kind of see
how that's sort of a tension of what
we're saying he doesn't understand this
concept
that it's really just a question of how
much
profit now there are instances
of course where you run a business where
you're barely taking any profit
whatsoever
and a minimum wage
you can't exploit you can't create that
much of a delta as much of a delta as
you want
between the productivity of your workers
and what you pay them there are
businesses like that now of course
what is also problematic with those is
things like your rent maybe your rent is
actually the problem here maybe your
other fixed costs or maybe you have a
bad business idea or maybe you don't
have access to other forms of capital
but the point is you shouldn't be
allowed to ship that onto your workers
and not only that which is true
but we know that the minimum wage
as it has been historically there has
been able to
create productivity and economic growth
in the past
here is um where
uh the the value of the minimum wage
well here do the other one the that one
yeah
so if you go back to the 1960s you will
see here from this chart
that the minimum wage
kept pace with
um where where the economy was
and then starting somewhere probably
around that same time 1970
some odd um it it dips
it doesn't keep a pace with productivity
this is just another way of looking at
that same uh chart except for instead of
this being
the delta between productivity and
compensation
now we're just looking at it relative to
the minimum wage if the minimum wage
was maintained from where it was last in
1968 the minimum wage has been around
since 1938 i think it was
and has been raised periodically maybe
maybe about a dozen times over the years
um if it had kept pace with productivity
in other words
if that dynamic which worked for so many
years
from 19
44 in this chart i guess through
to 1973 worked
and i would remind you we had great
massive economic expansion during that
period of time
and we had it broadly shared at least
amongst
um white people um
largely due to wars but it's beside the
point well
there was also a there was also a
um just a broadening of the middle class
you could you could argue that's a
function of like
the rest of the world rebuilding there's
there's an argument you could make for a
bunch of those things
um
but that starts going south in 1968 i
guess it was
where you start to see the minimum wage
not keeping nearly
at the pace of
of of what productivity is and let's
look at the other chart
which again just simply proves the point
that there is no dynamic where
an employer says like well you're worth
uh 12
to me in terms of my uh revenue here
and uh therefore i'm going to always pay
i'm going to pay you 10.
we're always going to have a dynamic of
five six that's the
iron law of compensation uh
you're gonna get um uh i'm gonna get you
know
you're gonna get five sixths of the
productivity that you make and the
problem with that is
that that's a fantasy it doesn't exist
because we have seen evidence that it
has moved
instead of five sixth two five seven
again five eight
five ninths just to be intellectually
honest and fair how we correlate this
though with the fact that no offense
brendan that
brendan is worth nothing to mcdonald's
as an employee right now
uh so how do we sort of figure out that
test here's another way of looking at
that same thing
the ratio of minimum wage to average
hourly wage for private production in
non-supervised works
it has uh basically steadily dropped
significantly over the years now it
bumps up in times of economic peril
2008 you can see there's a little jag
there but still
significantly less than it was in the
late 40s so there it is i mean
there it is with statistics this is not
for matt walsh
this is for everyone else who has a
more than just passing rudimentary
notion uh
high school junior high school notion of
how people are paid
in his earlier video and i noticed he
didn't address this here maybe we missed
it
he said if you work at mcdonald's
and you do a really good job you'll get
a raise
as if there are people do we have that
okay oh there's more
how much you know how how
how how much you're you're worth your
employer my contention about that fast
food worker is that
based on the effort and the skill he
brings to the table his financial worth
to his employer is minimal
and the reason it's minimal is that
almost anyone
could do what he does almost anyone
could replace him
they could fire him and there's a 99
chance that whoever walks in the door
next
however old they are they'll be six
years old they could do what that guy
does
so he's just not worth that much
financially to his employer
um and importantly here the automated
things that mcdonald's
that they already have set up that thing
can do what that guy does and do it
better actually
now that could change here's the good
news
he has the power to change it he could
come to work tomorrow energetic on the
ball helpful involved engaged
on time ready to work you know making
the customers feel good
upselling doing all this stuff he could
do that tomorrow and
instantly just like that in an instant
he could be worth considerably more than
a dollar an hour
pause it wow we last week we had on the
show
a woman who spent
[Music]
time working at amazon working at
mcdonald's working at
a call center and uh she wrote the book
what was the name what was the
uh on the clock on the clock emily
gundlesburg
can i fit anything else into this box i
just want to upsell it
she worked at mcdonald's and um there is
no
that first of all not only
instantaneously
do you become not more worth to your
employer uh the
last thing an employer would do like you
know what yesterday you were lazy today
you're great i'm giving you a raise to
do the same job
that doesn't happen at mcdonald's it
doesn't happen at
all at mcdonald's it doesn't happen over
time at mcdonald's
uh you don't get there's no people two
people working the fria later
and uh who have been working there for
the same time
and one's getting paid more that's not
the way it works
at mcdonald's and it's also not the case
that
they're paying just for the skill set
they're paying based upon
how much labor is available to me not
the quality of it how much
labor is available to me that can do
this
and how much control do i have monopsony
over their wages one of the big dynamics
that we have that's uh
problematic in this country and i know
this is a little bit far afield from
minimum wage
is that we have such
a uh um we have such
concentration of corporate power in this
country
you have a far fewer firms starting up
far less employers and what happens is
you get
single buyers for labor
in localities
and then to some extent nationally and
that drives down wages
which again is more proof that wages are
not a
function of the value you bring yes
there is a baseline that you have to
bring in terms of value to someone to
get hired
but wages are not merely a function
of the value you bring to the employer
there is a lot of other factors
so this his whole argument
about why a minimum wage is wrong is
fallacious i've said it before and i'll
say it again
there's nothing worse than unearned
pedentry indeed
in deed
uh let's go to the ims
um if you had to work wendy if you had
to work more than one job
to have a roof over your head or food on
the table you probably shouldn't have
taken that job that's not paying enough
that'd be a you problem
that's according to ben shapiro
right uh jonathan armstead
two days uh on the way home i was in the
subway stop i saw a person reading a
jordan peterson 12 rules for life i
walked by and yelled put that book down
and clean up your room a co-worker asked
what that meant and i explained who
that was she looked at the rules and
yesterday told me that based on peterson
own rules
he is a horrible person his transgender
phobia ignores rule nine assume
that the person you're listening to
might know something you don't that's
how stupid his philosophy is someone can
poke holes in it in a 30 second google
search on their iphone
has anyone heard from jordan peterson
lately i think he's taking it i feel
like g-check
literally destroyed him with facts and
logic g-check did him a good
did him a body blow but he's there's
some things in the work for the fall
sam uh thames darwin sam i'm heading to
barbados tomorrow for a week
with the lovely mrs darwin to celebrate
my 50th birthday which falls on a friday
since i won't be able to listen to mr
then can i get a
birthday shofar and maybe a little bit
of love from right-wing mandela
your time in barbados where you corrupt
and pollute another island with your
cosmopolitan values
and lack of patriotism calm from a 716
area code who's this where you come from
hey sam yes hey sam yes
colin um from dan from new york dan from
new york what's on your mind dan
well i'm just wondering if uh the
democrats are ever going to step
up and really pick up this fight because
they seem to be weak in almost every way
and i hear you talking
about it every time i listen and i'm
just a little disappointed in them and
i'm wondering
if they're going to step up and
represent the party they're supposed to
the party of the working class and the
party of the people
in any specific uh on any specific topic
are you talking generally
well in general and i know that over the
past couple of years i've heard you talk
about um
why aren't the democrats fighting why
aren't the democrats bringing up things
why isn't nancy pelosi saying anything
why isn't chuck schumer doing anything
and i think it's just a
a trend of weakness and
i'm i'm a little bit worried about
what's going to happen in the upcoming
election
well i'm worried about what's going to
happen in the upcoming election
um i am in a constant state of worry i
would say that
um i don't think whatever it is that
you're expecting
uh or hoping for from you know this
generation of leadership in the
democratic party i don't think we're
gonna get i think that there is
three oh three three oh oh
god um i do think
i do okay i do think that if you wanted
to be optimistic
you could find some optimism in the uh
the the younger generation of the party
and
in sort of the rise of of of of folks
like bernie sanders and
and even i think to a certain extent uh
elizabeth warren as well
um and and just where they have yeah
exactly and
and and um you know
how they've been able to pull the party
not just to the pull the party to the
left but they have a different
perspective on how to fight
how to work politics now i don't know
well hang on a second let me ask you
well well let me just finish this
i don't know if nancy pelosi
i don't know if nancy pelosi is um
just bad at politics or is
actually good at politics and just has a
radically different set of of of
political
uh ideas um than
i would want her to have it's the latter
it could be it couldn't but i think it's
a little bit of both
and probably largely irrelevant because
either way they gotta go
i wanna ask a quick question i was
listening i think i don't know if it was
yesterday or the day before when um
jeff from georgia called and he said
that um
the party is going to resist becoming
the party of
the working class because they fear and
activated and um an active
working-class set of voters and i think
it was um
might have been jamie that agreed with
jeff from georgia you know sometimes i
hear a voice in the background and i'm
not sure
i think nancy pelosi chuck schumer i
think the the democrat establishment
even though they could
handily win by activating working-class
voters
they fear an activated working class
because it uh kind of
it um would tend to upend the
establishment
i i think they probably fear
anybody who would in some way be a
threat to their power yes
and so um i i mean i think
i certainly my sense was in the 2016
election
that they were trying to fashion a
presidential win
with a coalition that involved these
republican
um you know republicans in the suburbs
and they thought they had it and it
turned out they didn't
um and yeah i think you're right i mean
i think
that they i think that they fear i mean
i don't know that they
say it so explicitly but i think that
they anything that
that strikes them is losing um their
power
in some fashion yes i think is
problematic i don't know
how how deep uh their assessment of it
is but i think they're allergic to that
without a doubt you just have to follow
the money
i mean i'm gonna answer this because you
said my name caller thank you
um yes like the the democratic
and the republican parties not to sound
too ad busters about it but they
are the left and right wings of
neo-liberal capitalism
at the moment and actually we did it we
did a bingo
yeah hell yeah we did uh well i wasn't
in it but sean did a history as a weapon
episode with matt christman from chapeau
trap house
where they talk about why the u.s never
had a workers party like other countries
have like most of the european countries
um the democratic party was always this
bizarre
cross-class coalition so if we want to
really realign it
into something and they have to do this
weird dance right they pretend to fight
for the working class
because but that's only part of the
coalition so they also have to represent
the interests of the bosses which are
diametrically opposed to the interests
of the workers
etc etc so if we really want to build
to realign the party and redraw the
electoral map
in a way that will a win and b
fight for progressive reforms for real
instead of pretending they want to but
actually not
actively standing in the way in many
cases
we need a new coalition and the moneyed
interests that fund them right now
cannot be part of it like it's fine if
people with money
if rich people if bosses want to vote
for bernie sanders
we'll take it but we cannot be pandering
and catering to their interests
all right sam i have two more things one
um one i'm afraid might offend you and
the second is more of a personal request
that might go off the grid
um take your time caller and
be very detailed ignore all of sam's
discomfort
when he's frustrated that means he wants
to hear more
there's some truth to that okay is he is
he frustrated no go ahead
go ahead go ahead dan wow let's go
all right thanks um the first is you
know i
i pay for a membership to the majority
report i don't pay a membership to jimmy
dore but i listen to both and i've heard
you really razz on jimmy dore but
there's one thing that he said
that i think rings true and i if i
started i almost bet you could finish
the phrase because i've heard you guys
razz on him all the time dan let me say
this
i hope there's at least one thing that
he says that's true
okay let me try this then let's see what
you think i'm suspecting he constantly
says
the democrats the democrats the
democrats would rather
lose to trump than win
with a progressive have you heard him
say that um
i i think he's i think i think he well i
know he said that
i think that's true for maybe some of
them like
i think maybe a guy like horse whisperer
who works for
exxon and uh eli lilly and whatnot yeah
i think yeah he's a clown i think well
no i think it's true for him
but do i think that's true for the vast
majority of democrats
do i think that's true for more than 75
percent of the democrats
absolutely not okay what about like say
nancy pelosi and chuck schumer i i don't
i don't know about nancy pelosi and
chuck schumer
i don't know i mean i
i think we can test that proposition
but there's no doubt in my mind there's
no doubt in my mind
that yes there are some democrats who
are like i am
i've lived through four years of trump i
got my tax cuts
probably they would say i would have to
guess and
they are uh afraid of someone like
bernie sanders i think maybe even you
could probably find a small subset that
would also be afraid of elizabeth warren
i mean there's no doubt yeah sure but
you know what
there was supposedly uh you know a lot
of uh democrat
republicans who said like i would rather
you know um
have hillary clinton than uh donald
trump i mean i'm
none of that should be a surprise i
think i will i want to say i mean i
think
uh i'll meet somewhere in the middle but
anybody that was on the list of that new
york times meeting
uh reporting that came out in april
of you know meetings with nira tandon
and nancy pelosi and pete budej was at
some of them
that were literally specifically focused
on stopping bernie sanders
i don't know if i would necessarily say
that all the people in those meetings
would prefer trump to bernie that's a
that's a jump but they are certainly
people who are
deranged enough to
uh you know be conspiring against bernie
at a time when frankly they could
support their own candidates
and just move forward and think about a
general election yes there is
there is a
that is not going to be uh that is not
going to try
and and a lie against someone who is
threatening to completely upset the
apple car no doubt about that
that's important for people and the fact
i would say this
the fact that there's such a concerted
effort to stop bernie that's a good sign
indicates to me
that the problem they realize is that
we've got to support him in the general
over trump i mean well there's also i
think there's also
the other the big thing to watch is the
degree and the intensity like there was
a lot of people who
and i think this might actually change
when britain goes for elections but in
2017 you know people like tony blair
were like
i vote labor i always vote labor as in
yes i'm going to vote for jeremy corbyn
but right they did everything they could
to undermine that performance to the
point where they clearly would prefer
a win and look we know
that um what was it 20 uh
25 of of of clinton voters
did not vote for for barack obama right
in 2008
and so this is a dynamic that's not i
mean
people you know i think i you know there
was 12 percent of
of bernie people who last time um you
know
didn't support uh clinton so there's
always going to be a segment of
a part i mean look i i you tell me like
how many people um do you hear threaten
not to vote for joe biden
over donald trump i mean look that
dynamic exists
it exists uh you know on on all
different sides
i mean there you know i if somebody
invited me to a meeting on how to stop
joe biden i'd go
you know what i mean like hi
one thing the party could do though is
get over its romance with people like
mike bloomberg and anna navarro who
hell yeah absolutely not vote for bernie
over trump
i actually put him on i think i have no
defense no defense of michael bloomberg
i hate michael bloomberg i'll put my
dislike against anybody that clip that
was going around to bloomberg not
committing to endorse everybody i have
to say
by bloomberg standards was shockingly
open i think i couldn't believe
said every single person in the
democratic field running for president
is better than trump
yeah that was i mean that's more
unequivocal
than you will hear from people who have
superficially better reputation
look they invited michael bloomberg to
the
the convention it was stupid it was dumb
and it was like they thought they were
being cute by half
and et cetera but when you talk about
like the democratic party's embrace of
ann navarro like i would bet you that
nine people like her
okay well i mean but like whom like i
mean i think like
the point is like suburban moderates
that famous quote from
a friend chuck schumer yes right that
was my point is i think they were trying
to fashion
a a um uh a
i think the democratic leadership was
trying to fashion a win
and how'd that go for them it blew up in
their face and
so i mean i think like i guess i
what i take issue too with is this
notion of the democrats
like you know like the the democrats
in 15 years could easily be
aoc and and and
justice democrats throughout the
leadership and we'll be talking about
them differently then
maybe hopefully i think i i think
i think i think easily i think easily
might be a jump
because i think the establishment
democrats are going to
fight it tooth and nail of course nobody
wants to give up power
of course
i don't know this
i've taken up a lot of your time i
haven't i have an education thing for
you
um next year is going to be my 20th year
teaching in public schools in new york
now i'm a little bit
north of you i'm out in the rural area
but i have to tell you that i appreciate
the hell out of everything you say about
schools about education about public
schools and education reform i think
you've really got your
your head on right about those things
and being a father
of three beautiful girls two of whom are
off to college and one who's still got a
few years left in
high school i'd like to get a chance to
ask you like about your experiences
as a parent trying to find the right
schools for your kids and like what you
did about it
in an urban setting because i do some
writing that i
um put on different different locations
and i just don't know what it's like to
be a parent in a city trying to find
the right school for my kids well i i i
will say this
that in the brooklyn district
that we live um we live with a great
elementary school although it's become a
lot less diverse in the past probably
ten years
um we the the middle schools
varied and when my daughter applied for
middle school they had a system that was
just
horrible it it it made the kids compete
against each other you had to go in some
of them that she had to like
have interviews these are all public
schools and
uh they now in district 15 in brooklyn
it's lottery
which is much better now the only
problem with it is that
but the only problem is some kids may
have to travel further than others
it's just you may end up not going to
the school that's right next to your
neighborhood but i think that's the only
the only like good way to do it in terms
of like
providing as much diversity as you
possibly can
in high school she applied to 15
different
high schools and
my daughter sings she auditioned she got
into um
laguardia but she was like i don't want
to travel an hour each way
on the subway every day hour and ten
minutes and
sing opera for three hours and so she
ended up going to another
very solid school that was a lot more
economically
and and socially diverse
and there's still a good you know music
program there too so
um it's it's hard it's a lot of work and
i frankly
don't know you know um my
uh my my former wife and i we
we i don't know spent hundreds of
dollars
on like taking courses that provide us
with like here's how to apply to these
schools
here's a list of really good schools and
getting on like
email lists and this and that we both
have the money to afford to like
a babysitter when we go to like one of
these talks we have the money to join
these things like
it is it i think it's
it's it's extremely challenging and what
we really need to do is just build
as many good schools as possible
and that means really basically
addressing poverty in a large
logic space if only getting your kid
into a good school was as easy as being
a
no extra charge boom but uh
things like uh university okay universal
pre-k i think is huge
and i think i would even take it a year
younger because if you do that
and you provide a quality pre-k
situation
you're going to see huge improvements i
think in schools across the board
but and sam i want to thank you yeah
i want to thank you because your
experience is vastly different than mine
out here in the country
where i've pretty much spent my whole
life where your school is this
the school that you have whatever is
serving your community and even though
you have had to bust your ass you've
avoided the
the bad teacher failing school evil
unions talk that a lot of education
reformers have like clutched
yeah well there's been some of that i
mean the schools that i've
my kids have gone to unfortunately have
been sort of like on the vanguard of
like protesting about
high stakes testing and whatnot but yeah
i mean the place i grew up it was more
or less like that too i mean we had
four high schools in the city and you
went to the one that you live near
but the the the you know the bottom line
is the way that we
fund education in this country is a
proxy for
basically how we could segregate schools
and that's a problem
segregate yes exactly segregation i
appreciate
that sam thank you for your time thanks
oh he didn't have anything more
there was nothing there wasn't anything
else he would like to explore
you didn't get uh terribly critical uh
we got time for one more
one more uh one more caller calling from
a 682 area code who's this where you
call him from
yeah is this me yes it is you
yeah uh i was originally gonna call to
uh satirize jimmy dore
okay um but then you start talking about
matt wash and then the last guy brought
jimmy jordan so i'm going to satirize
him anyways
okay well let me skip the satire and
we're just going to get to the point
um anyone who's still listening to him
they just need to know whenever he says
that he's an idiot and he knows
something
and whenever he figured when he figured
out that he's an idiot
so that means everyone else has to know
it like he's been a complete hypocrite
whenever he's calling on
other people gaslighting so i had a
funny story to satirize that but i'm not
going to
second anyways is yesterday you had a
calling from nebraska
yeah talking about uh why
why doesn't bernie go to nebraska and do
a speech there about rural america
well he had a speech in oh stage iowa
in may and he has a plan that's the
revitalizing
rural america plan so
just try to point that out all right
people come in and also regarding
yeah regarding matt walsh i'd like to
hear his plan
on how do people pay for whenever they
cost the company money so like when a
fund manager
who normally does get paid based on the
percentage of his production
uh what happens whenever they lose
millions of dollars for a company
so that's it good point appreciate the
call all right folks that's it for our
calling option uh portion of the program
i'm going to read a couple of items and
then we'll get out of here
uh water boat from cashmere the cashmere
issue is a symptom of a larger problem
of fascism that india has the scraping
of kashmir's autonomy is the inciting
incident the next act which has begun
fascism the global phenomena in india
has a billion people anyone who thinks
that
the fascist takeover in india is not
their concern is being a racist because
brown fascism is still fascism and
accelerating in
india also not interested in one's own
survival if you look at it from uh well
he goes this will come back and bite
humanity in a big way very soon right
the effects of climate change
also are pretty apparent there no and i
don't know about
as much about it i don't know how much
they play into the question of casualty
it plays
into well it's it's it's a
gentrification it's a it's a
massive tourism and housing market
opportunity because it changes residency
rules
that's a big part of it too but anyways
i am uh
good at uh sex you're bad at sex
david frum thinks trump is a marxist
uh putin yeah that was hilarious putin
on the fritz i found this interesting i
really get
into political arguments online but i
got into it with either pretty hardcore
member of the yang gang or a member of
his campaign social media team on reddit
over his version of ubi
i'd love to say that i came up with some
original arguments but for the most part
just parroting what you guys said about
it to him
to my surprise the guy fully called me
on it saying the dismantling of the
social safety net is also wrong and it's
puppeted by people here
who put way too much faith into a very
biased sam cedar
it is unbelievable the the
the how much i am trafficked i think in
these arguments
um but you got to give it to the yang
people for their social media savvy
i mean i think to a certain extent um
they really they really need to find
someone who has
more value to them in terms of uh of
their argument but
i mean look we've made it quite clear um
the problem is he went on uh dave rubin
and basically gave up the ghost
and he doesn't support a minimum wage
increase for god's sake retconned i've
been talking to everybody i can who
about and we also missed the whole
climate change thing
i did that i did that on my show and it
was funny because burgess sent it to me
because i totally missed it
i was playing it out and he's just like
you take your thousand dollars
move to higher ground i was like what
wait a second
that was amazing brendan caught it we
missed it yeah
um i've been talking to everyone i can
about who they're going to vote for and
even people who think bernie is kind of
radical say they're going to vote for
him people in their 20s 30s and up in
their 60s i know this isn't scientific
but it made me feel so much better well
we'll see
colorado guy have any candidates talked
about legislation that would give
financial assistance or debt forgiveness
to families or individuals with high
amounts of medical debt now
yes i think actually um i think
oh i don't know about that so i quote
tweeted
this is we'll see i'll but i'll say this
this is public and it was kind of funny
when bernie first announced their you
know the best student loan forgiveness
plan
i quote tweeted it and i said you know
this is groundbreaking this is amazing
blah blah blah
let's do it next step medical debt
relief
and uh josh orton you know who's bernie
sanders advisor
a sam cedar alum uh tweeted back at me
like a a uh like a thinking face emoji
kind of implying like that i i think
that's on deck
that's very possible uh secret identity
politics the neo-liberal language of
people serving the economy rather than
the other way around
finally makes its way to immigration
talk melts my brain a bit um
also what is common sense supposed to be
uh loose left
cody i'm on waiting on hold and i can't
hear sam
uh majora i just saw the full
animation of the fun half song and
realized there's a reference to caller
brenda's cinematic vision for the rand
paul lawn incident
brilliant that's amazing
all right three more leon grotzky hey
sam any thoughts on portnoy telling
sitting congressman asc that he'd be
willing to break national labor laws and
fire unionizing employees on the spot
